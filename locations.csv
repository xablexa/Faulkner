"""Knight's Gambit""","KGB","995","Backus-Harriss Plantation","Mansion","Text (when unambiguous)","The Mansion, The Town","1 330","365","<p>The ""old plantation"" on the ""good land"" north of Jefferson where the Harrisses live was probably built before the Civil War as a slave plantation.  Its more recent history is a major focus of the story, as it evolves (or, the narrative suggests, devolves) from a cotton farm worked by sharecroppers to one worked by wage laborers under the control of a non-local manager to a thoroughbred stable and show place owned by Mr. Harriss, who lives there only for a fraction of the year. The narrative describes in detail how Harriss ""transmogrifies"" a ""once-simple country house"" into a ""county (or for that matter, a north Mississippi) landmark: a mile square of white panel and rail paddock- and pasture-fences and electric-lit stables"" (141). The story gives a lot of historical background, referred to as ""legend,"" about the plantation.  For example, Charles  remembers it this way:  ""the old plantation six miles from town which had been an old place even in his grandmother's time, not so big in acreage but of good land properly cared for and worked, with the house on it which was not large either but was just a house, a domicile, more spartan even than comfortable"" (150).  Interestingly, the plantation is described as a gentleman-scholar-farmer's residence:  ""and the widower-owner who stayed at home and farmed his heritage and, with a constant tumbler of thin whiskey-and-water at his elbow and the aged setter bitch dozing at his feet, sat through the long summer afternoons in a home-made chair on the front gallery, reading in Latin the Roman poets"" (150).  Beyond the gallery was a ""garden which was just a garden, overgrown, shabby too, of old permanent perennial things: nameless roses and lilac bushes and daisies and phlox and the hard durable dusty bloom of fall"" (242).  Gavin Stevens remembers the garden in detail: ""It was a good deal bigger than even five or six rugs, spread side by side, with old bushes of roses and callicanthus and paintless collapsing arbors and trellises and beds of perennials re-seeding themselves without outside meddling help"" (246).  All this is before it becomes the property of a rich bootlegger from New Orleans: ""Harriss took command of the plantation,"" dramatically modernizing it, with ""electric lights and running water in the house, and the day-long, night-long thump and hum of the pump and dynamo were the mechanical sounds where there used to be the creak of the hand-turned well-pulley and of the ice-cream freezer on Sunday mornings"" (159).  Eventually Harriss rents the farmland out to a man who commutes to it from Memphis to work the land with heavy machinery, and people from the country drive to watch as it is surrounded by white-painted fences, long stables built with better material than most of their homes, ""with electric lights and illuminated clocks and running water and screened windows"" (161).  Harriss also rebuilds the house into a ""monstrosity"" (170) where he entertains his friends from New Orleans:  ""It had been just a house, of one storey [sic], with the gallery across the front where the old master would sit in his home-made chair with his toddy and his Catullus; when Harriss got through with it, it looked like the Southern mansion in the moving picture, only about five times as big and ten times as Southern"" (162).  Charles Mallison notes the opulence of the grounds when he walks them:  ""the house that was too big, across the lawn where the bushes and shrubs were too many, past the garages that would have held more cars than just four people could ever have used and the conservatoires and hothouses of too many flowers and grapes for just four people to ever have eaten or smelled"" (226).  The grounds include a polo field and steeplechase course (226), and a small stable built by Captain Gualdres away from the estate's main stables - these last two sites have their own entries in the database. </p>","","","","","","","","","Harriss Plantation","Rebuilt","Plantation; Stable; Sports Facility; Entertainment Site; Garden|Arbor","Site of Event","","","","",""

Physically, the county jail begins as the ""mortised-log, mud-chinked shake-down"" building that is one of the first structures erected by the whites who settle Yoknapatawpha around the turn into the 19th century (4).

The city is most elaborately evoked by Mr. Compson in Chapter 4, during his reconstruction of the visit Bon and Henry pay to New Orleans on the eve of the Civil War.  New Orleans already had a reputation as a sensuous place, but Compson's account oozes sexuality.  The city's architecture is ""a little curious, a little femininely flamboyant and therefore to Henry opulent, sensuous, sinful"" (87).  The remainder of his account is a heavily guided tour through a realm of aristocratic pleasures.  The stops include: the city's public spaces (""the flash and glitter of a myriad carriage wheels,"" ""women, enthroned"" and ""men in linen a little finer and diamonds a little brighter,"" 88); the private auction house in which mixed-race women are sold as concubines (""a neighborhood a little decadent,"" the place ""invested . . . with something of secret and curious and unimaginable delights"" (89); the adjacent enclosed dueling ground, with ""only the most recent of the brown stains showing"" (90); the living quarters of the woman Compson calls Bon's mistress and her child: ""a place created for and by voluptuousness"" (91); and ""Bon's rooms"" in an unspecified part of the city (95).  In the larger novel, New Orleans figures as the place where Bon comes from, and where his mother and the unnamed lawyer who shape his destiny live; there are several scenes in both her house (with its ""rich baroque"" furnishings, 263) and his office (with its ""secret drawer in the secret safe,"" 241).</p>","","","","","","","","","New Orleans","Continuous","City; Slave Market","Site of Event","","","","",""

Similarly, in the midst of a tiff between Charles and Maggie Mallison over Gavin's relationship with Eula Snopes, Charlie says ""That's what you want, is it? a husband that will spend every Saturday night in Memphis chasing back and forth between Gayoso and Mulberry Street"" (50). Gayoso Street was the heart of the red light district until Mayor Edward “Boss” Crump shut down the city’s brothels in the 1940s.  Mulberry Street, in contrast, was a predominately white, middle-class working neighborhood (laid out in 1840 by prominent attorney and businessman Robertson Topp).  Charles's reference, therefore, is a taunt that what Maggie wants is a husband who will cheat on his spouse. Gayoso Street runs into the notorious Beale Street, a black district known in the 20th century for its music, raucous nightclubs, and dangerous atmosphere.

Germany conquered both these Belgian forts in the early stages of the war.  1848 is a significant date in the creation of a unified Germany.  Gavin instead chooses to serve with the French as a stretcher-bearer working with the American Field Service ""just behind Verdun"" - the scene of protracted fighting during 1916 (110).  After being wounded there, and spending some time at home, Gavin returns to France with the Y.M.C.A., accompanied by Montgomery Ward Snopes were in charge of a canteen at a ""little town"" Chalons (120).

Before returning to the U.S., Snopes acquires a collection of pornographic images in Paris as well.  On a more heroic note, the Sartoris twins, Bayard and John, ""go to England into the Royal Flying Corps"" (110); the story of their service over the skies in France is told in several other texts.

Jefferson was built at the center of Yoknapatawpha, and at the center of Jefferson is Courthouse Square.  At the center of the Square is the county courthouse, topped by the ""four identical faces of the courthouse clock"" that face ""north and east and south and west"" (333).  Inside the courthouse is posted the ordinance prohibiting motor vehicles within the city, ""copied out on a piece of parchment like a diploma or a citation and framed and hung on the wall"" by Mayor de Spain in an irreverent mood (14).  In front of it stands a ""Confederate monument"" (118), and back of it sits ""the little brick house . . . that Judge Dukinfield calls his chambers"" (102).  The town's ""city hall"" may be in the courthouse, or nearby on the Square (31).  The town's main places of business surround the courthouse, facing each other from across the four streets that form the ""Square.""  When Gavin and Linda walk around the town in Chapter 15, we get brief cumulative description of its business district in ""the late spring"": ""the hardware and farm-furnish stores cluttered with garden and farm tools and rolls of uncut plowline and sample sacks of slag and fertilizer and even the grocery ones exposing neat cases of seed packets stencilled with gaudy and incredible vegetables and flowers"" (227).  Gavin also tells us that the population of Jefferson in the 1920s is 3,000 (219).<br />
Throughout Digital Yoknapatawpha we use the Square as the default location for events that are not set in a specific place in Jefferson - for example, we identify the Square as the place from which all three of the novel's narrators tell their parts of the story.</p>","","","","","","","","","Courthouse Square","Continuous","Courthouse and Square; Courthouse|Office; Jefferson Event","Site of Event","","","","",""

From the minor descriptions of the rooms - the porch, the dining room (12), kitchen (14), a room ""which [Father] and the negroes called the Office"" (15) but Granny calls the library ""because there was one bookcase in it"" (16), back gallery (17), Granny's and Bayard's room upstairs - the house seems to be a typical antebellum two-story house in the middle of the Sartoris plantation.  It is located at the end of a ""big road"" where there is a gate, is next to a hill, has a back yard, and is surrounded by a well house, woodpile, stable (also referred to as the barn), pasture, stock pen, orchard of apple trees, various negro cabins, and a fence.  When the house is burned by the Yankees, Bayard passes by the ""ash pile and the chimneys standing up out of it"" (79).  In ""Skirmish at Sartoris,"" Bayard describes the process of rebuilding the mansion: ""getting the cypress and oak out of the bottom to build the house"" (192).  In ""An Odor of Verbena"" the rebuilt house is complete:  ""Father had rebuilt the house too, on the same blackened spot, over the same cellar, where the other had burned, only larger, much larger"" (220).  Indeed, the descriptions of the new house are much more ornate, and specifically the parlor - ""the formal brilliant room arranged formally for obsequy"" - where John Sartoris is at rest with a ""festive glitter of chandeliers"" (219) and a piano (240).  Bayard, moreover, expands on this description on his arrival home: ""I could see the lights, the chandeliers - hall, parlor, and what Aunt Jenny . . . had taught even Ringo to call the drawing room, the light falling outward across the portico, past the columns"" (232) and the ""brilliant door and windows"" (234). Other rooms are mentioned such as the dining room, Father's office,  Drusilla's room upstairs, and Bayard's room where he finds the spring of verbena on his pillow.</p>","","","","","","","","","Sartoris Plantation","Destroyed and Rebuilt","Plantation; Plantation Grounds; Combat Zone","Site of Event","","","","",""

The novel's best cue to the various Whiteleaf locations comes when the sheriff asks about another way to Jefferson from Mink Snopes' place, and a deputy tells him that the ""old Whiteleaf Bridge road"" is fourteen miles away, that when they get to that road they are ""nine miles from Whiteleaf store"" and when they get to the store they are still ""eight miles from Jefferson"" (pp 282-83).  Much of the route ""winds among the pines hills,"" but the village store sits ""in the long broad rich flatlands"" under cultivation (283).  The store is also described as eight miles from Frenchman's Bend when it becomes the original venue of the two civil suits at the end of the novel (356).  Our placements try to take these distances into account, though all are essentially informed speculation.  The store seems to be a typical crossroads country store.  It is too small to hold all the people who attend the trials, which take place instead in ""the locust grove beside the store"" (356).

The novel does not explicitly provide the  date when Carothers built it, but we presume that happened before 1807, when according to the ledgers he traveled to New Orleans to purchase Eunice (253).  In ""The Bear,"" however, the narrative calls that same house ""the tremendous cavern which Old Carothers had started but never finished"" (286).  It sits on top of a knoll covered with oaks and cedars; Sophonsiba Beauchamp's dowry provides the means to finish it after the Civil War.  One of the novel's major thematic concerns revolves around ownership of this property.  It was originally founded by Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin, then belonged to his two sons.   Carothers (Cass) Edmonds gained ownership of the plantation when Ike McCaslin repudiated his inheritance.  In the later parts of the novel it belongs to Carothers (Roth) Edmonds, Cass' grandson.

The boundary line for Beat Four is specifically ""five miles from town"" at the start of the pine hills to the northeast of Jefferson (91).

Beat Four has a constable like the others, but is described as a law unto itself; as one townsman says, ""Hope Hampton might be sheriff in Yoknapatawpha County but he's just another man in Beat Four"" (39).  This ""region of lonely pine hills dotted meagrely with small tilted farms"" is inhabited by ""brawlers and farmers and foxhunters and stock- and timber-traders"" along with ""whiskeymakers"" for whom the hills that make it hard to grow cotton or more corn than a moonshiner needs remind the inhabitants of ""the Scottish highlands"" their ancestors came from (145).

The property was deeded to him by Carothers Edmunds' father, in recognition of the fact that Lucas is the (illegitimate, bi-racial) grandson of the same patriarch, the white planter Carothers McCaslin, whom the Edmunds family descends from.  Lucas' land is described as an ""oblong of earth set forever in the middle of a two thousand acre plantation like a postage stamp in the center of an envelop"" (8), and the walk up the ""half gully and half road"" that mounts to his cabin is characterized with adjectives that set Lucas as well as his property apart from Yoknapatawpha's conventional racial patterns: ""solitary independent and intractable too"" (8).  The narrative equivocates about what to call his home, using the phrase ""the house, the cabin"" when Chick first sees it (8), and the contradictory note of poverty and pride it strikes obviously confuses the twelve-year-old son of an old white family.  The adjective ""paintless"" is used seven times in its description (8, 9), but the yard is tidy and the secondhand furnishings inside are arranged with an air of dignity.  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> the symbolic center of Lucas' home is the undying fire in the hearth that he first lit when he brought his wife Molly into the cabin; the narrative of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> seems to allude to that when Chick almost remembers something the first time he sees the fireplace (10, 14).  But in this novel the centerpiece of the home is the large portrait photo of Lucas and Molly in their finest clothes set in a frame of ""gold-painted wood on a gold-painted easel"" (10).  Readers of Faulkner saw a similarly formal photograph in the upper-class home of Emily Grierson, in ""A Rose for Emily.""

In this case its occupants are a husband, a wife and three children, none of whose names are ever given.  It is further from Jefferson than the MacCallum place, on the road but in a very isolated part of the country, but how much further is not specified.  The man grows cotton ""right up to his back door"" (363), the cabin is a single impoverished room with ""a broken hearth"" (364).  Bayard spends his last night in Yoknapatawpha - Christmas Eve - in the hayloft of the barn, and in the morning has breakfast and Christmas dinner with the family in the cabin before the man takes him eight miles further to the next town.</p>","","","","30","FD17","","","30","Negro Cabin","Continuous","Negro-occupied Cabin; Barn","Site of Event","","","","",""

On Faulkner's two maps of Yoknapatawpha the spot is home to two families, with three different names: the MacCallums (in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>), whose name is spelled McCallum in two later texts; and the McCaslins (in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> and elsewhere).  As the MacCallum|McCallum place, it was built in 1866 by Virginius MacCallum; as the McCaslin place it has its own location entry, but it's significant that in that incarnation the spot is the site of a large antebellum slave plantation.  There is no taint of slavery associated with the MacCallum|McCallum property.  The MacCallums have a Negro cook, and seem to have Negro tenants who farm parts of their land, but they are identified as yeoman farmers rather than planters, and associated with hunting and making moonshine. There are some old fields near the MacCallum place, but they are going back to woodland. Otherwise the house, made of ""chinked logs"" and ""hand-trimmed"" floor boards (332), lies deep in the woods among ragged hills and ravines. This location includes the ""lean-to room"" attached to the house where Buddy sleeps and Bayard stays during his visit (340). The kitchen is in ""a separate building,"" which has its own entry (336), and does the ""spring house"" which is one of the outbuildings on the property (338).</p>","","","","30","FD16","","","30","MacCallum Place","Continuous","Farm House","Site of Event","","","","",""
