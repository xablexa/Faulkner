"001","Sartoris Bank|Merchants' and Farmers' Bank","","","","","","","<p>This bank is the first piece of unreal estate in Yoknapatawpha that Faulkner created.  Both the unfinished ""Father Abraham"" manuscript and <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, his first published Yoknapatawpha fiction, begin inside the bank - ""Abraham"" with Flem Snopes as its president; <em>Flags</em> with old Bayard Sartoris in control.  Bayard founded it in the 1890s, which is why colloquially it is referred to as the 'Sartoris Bank,' but its official name is the Merchants' and Farmers' Bank.  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, Faulkner's second Yoknapatawpha fiction, ""the old Merchants' and Farmers' Bank"" is described as having ""failed"" sometime before 1928 (216), but in nine more texts, from ""That Evening Sun"" through <em>The Reivers</em>, it remains open and prosperous.  The calculated steps by which Flem Snopes becomes its president is a major narrative element in the last two volumes of the Snopes trilogy, which in a sense bring Faulkner's imagination back to that origin moment in ""Father Abraham.""  In <em>The Town</em> it is also called ""the new bank"" (44), to distinguish it from the older Bank of Jefferson, which was founded in ""1830 or so"" (280).   Faulkner's own grandfather, John Wesley Thompson Falkner, started the First National Bank of Oxford in 1910.  Banks, of course, are supposed to <em>preserve</em> things from loss, but just as Old Bayard loses control of his bank and Flem ultimately ends up in charge of it, in 1920 J.W.T. Falkner was forced to resign from the bank's presidency.  In his fiction, however, Falkner's grandson could maintain ultimate control over the bank's fortunes.

"003","Jefferson Square Monuments","","","","","","","<p>""The slender white pencil of the Confederate monument"" - that is how <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> refers to the statue of an unidentified Confederate soldier that stands atop a tall pedestal in front of the courthouse in the Square at the center of Jefferson (48).  This monument appears in 8 fictions.  <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> provides the most detail about it and its history, and includes an account of the ""Confederate Decoration Day"" in 1900 when Colonel Sartoris' sister, Virginia DuPre, officially unveiled it and the town's surviving Confederate veterans sounded one last 'rebel yell' (188).  According to <em>Requiem</em>, the monument was ""instigated"" and paid for by the United Daughters of the Confederacy - a real Southern organization that in the decades right before and after 1900 erected many of the real Confederate monuments across the South (189).  Also according to <em>Requiem</em>, neither the U.D.C. nor the ""architect"" who designed the monument noticed that the soldier faces <em>south</em>, ""toward (if anything) his own rear"" - apparently looking ""for reinforcements"" (190).  This ""Confederate soldier gazing with empty eyes beneath his marble hand in wind and weather"" figures most significantly in the last scene of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (319), when Benjy Compson is briefly traumatized by being taken the 'wrong' way around the statue during his regular trip to the town cemetery.  That event is echoed, though it's hard to say how intentionally or ironically, when <em>Go Down, Moses</em> ends with the hearse carrying the black body of Samuel Worsham Beauchamp ""circling the Confederate monument"" on his trip ""home"" to a cemetery in the county (363).  Several fictions mention the different 'monument' that pays a perverse kind of tribute to Flem Snopes and his anti-heroic venality: the town's tall water tower, where one of Flem's corrupt schemes has made the water undrinkable.  Less obvious though perhaps also worth noting in connection with the town's official monument to the 'Lost Cause' and its defeated heroes is the image that forms in Quentin Compson's thoughts earlier in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, of ""Colonel Sartoris"" and his grandfather General Compson ""wearing his uniform"" on ""a high place looking across at something"" (176).  Faulkner considered the Confederate monument significant enough to include it as one of the Yoknapatawpha places he included on his first map of the county, and even though most of the fictions that mention the monument do so only briefly, in passing, it's probably always appropriate to consider the context in which those references occur, or even to think about how, in both a geographic and historical and ideological sense, this statue stands at the center of Yoknapatawpha.  On the other hand, it's also interesting to wonder why, in some texts, the statue is conspicuous by its absence.  For example, in <em>Light in August</em>, Byron Bunch stands outside the courthouse ""beneath the portico which faced the south side of the square,"" and notes how ""the stone columns rose, arching, weathered, stained with generations of casual tobacco"" (415); but Bryon (who is one of Faulkner's few major characters who leave their 'past' behind) does <em>not</em> make any reference to the marble soldier who in so many other Faulkner texts stands outside the courthouse's south side.    And one text, <em>Requiem</em>, adds two new monuments to the Square: ""a French point-seventy-five field piece squatting on one flank of the base of the Confederate monument"" that is apparently a memorial to the soldiers who fought (as American rather than Confederate soldiers) during World War I (190); and (presumably on the statue's other ""flank"") a memorial to the combatants of World War II that very explicitly marks both a re-united and still divided United States: an anti-tank gun ""captured from a regiment of Germans in an African desert by a regiment of Japanese in American uniforms, whose mothers and fathers at the time were in a California detention camp for enemy aliens"" (194).  These don't appear in any other texts.  As supplements to the original statue, they locate 'Yoknapatawpha' in a much larger context, even racially.</p>

"004","Sartoris Plantation ","","","","","","","<p>First appearing in the first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, as the antebellum plantation ""that John Sartoris built and rebuilt"" (8), the Sartoris place four miles north of Jefferson is one of the most frequently visited locations in the Yoknapatawpha fictions.  How it survived the challenges of the Civil War - including Yankee soldiers and emancipationist ideas - is dramatized in <em>The Unvanquished</em> stories.  In <em>Flags</em> it has survived almost intact into the 20th century, its fields now being worked by tenant farmers rather than slaves, though by the end of the novel its future as a material representation of the Old South and the plantation aristocracy is unclear.  In later fictions it is referred to more often than described; suggestively, in its chronologically last appearances (the final two volumes of the Snopes trilogy) it is a place to hunt quail.  (Fourteen separate sites on the Sartoris plantation have their own entries in this index.)</p>

"005","Mitchell House","","","","","","","<p>The narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> calls this ""huge brick house set well up onto the street"" (24) a ""majestic monstrosity"" (180).  Built on the site of a ""fine old colonial house"" by ""a hillman who had moved in [to Jefferson] from a small settlement called Frenchman's Bend,"" it is described as ""an architectual garbling so imposingly terrific as to possess a kind of majesty"" (24).  It is built close to the street in the fashion of the country rather than set back on a deep lawn, as dictated by the town's upper-class traditions (a practice endorsed throughout the fictions by Faulkner himself).  When the hillman left Jefferson two years after building it, he sold it to ""a new-comer to town,"" presumably Harry Mitchell (24).  Behind the house Harry and Belle Mitchell live in is a new tennis court.</p>

"006","Benbow House","","","","","","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> the ancestral home where Horace and Narcissa live is one of the oldest houses in one of Jefferson's oldest and most aristocratic neighborhoods.  It was built in the 1840s by an English architect in what the narrator calls ""the funereal light tudor which the young Victoria had sanctioned"" (163).  It is set well back from the street, with extensive, well-landscaped front grounds.  To Horace Benbow, seeing it again for the first time after experiencing the Great War in France, the house expresses ""the meaning of peace"" (163).  After Horace and Narcissa move out, the house stays empty for a decade, until Horace re-opens it in <em>Sanctuary</em>.  Horace is still looking for refuge, from a bad marriage and modernity.  Just as his sister Narcissa insists that the former Memphis prostitute her brother is helping not be allowed to stay in the house, so he himself tries unsuccessfully to keep Clarence Snopes (an embodiment of the newer, coarser South) from getting inside.  Interestingly, even in <em>Flags</em> the quasi-obscene letters that another Snopes, Bryon, writes Narcissa <em>do</em> get into the house - as Bryon himself does, illegally, one night.</p>

"007","County Jail","","","","","","","<p>The jail in Jefferson appears in 16 different texts.  In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, the first Yoknapatawpha fiction, it's Bayard Sartoris who spends a night there; although he has been drinking, the jailer treats him as a guest rather than an inmate.  In the other instances its inmates are lower class characters and, especially, Negroes.  Jabbo Gatewood, for example, in <em>The Town</em>, is a black man who is regularly jailed for drunkenness.  The jail includes the ""living quarters"" of the jailer and his family, a ""bullpen"" where black prisoners are confined in a group, and a single cell usually reserved for white prisoners, though there are major exceptions to this - including Lucas Beauchamp, a central character in the detective fiction <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, which originated in Faulkner's idea to have someone falsely accused of murder solve the mystery from inside a cell.  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> - which organizes the story of Jefferson's early years around the jail and includes a final act titled ""The Jail"" - Gavin Stevens says that the best way to learn ""the history of a community"" is to study the graffiti drawn by successive generations of prisoners on their cell walls (168).  Faulkner never does that, though one of the jail's windows includes the signature that a jailer's daughter scratched there with a diamond ring during the Civil War (he tells three versions of that story: <em>The Unvanquished</em>, <em>Intruder</em>, <em>Requiem</em>).  Among the jail's most significant inmates are Lee Goodwin (in <em>Sanctuary</em>), Joe Christmas (in <em>Light in August</em>), Rider (in ""Pantaloon in Black""), Mink Snopes (in all three volumes in the Snopes trilogy), and Nancy Mannigoe (in both ""That Evening Sun"" and <em>Requiem</em>).</p>

"008","Holston House","","","","","","","<p>Along with the jail, the Holston House is the oldest continuously standing building in Jefferson.  It began as a tavern, founded by Alexander Holston, one of the town's original three white inhabitants.  As <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> notes, it is ""still"" exists in mid-20th century Jefferson, with its ""original log walls and puncheon floors and hand-mortised joints . . . still buried somewhere beneath the modern pressed glass and brick veneer and neon tubes"" of the ""hotel"" owned and managed by descendants of the first Holston (7, 167).  According to <em>The Mansion</em>, the traditions it preserves are not those of the town's frontier origins but of Victorian gentility: it ""still clung to the old ways, not desperately nor even gallantly: just with a cold and inflexible indomitability"" so that ""no man"" dined there ""without a coat and necktie and no woman with her head covered"" (421).  According to <em>Requiem</em>, the kitchen of the Holston House is the site of ""the settlement's first municipal meeting"" (12).  The hotel is also where Sutpen stays when he arrives in Jefferson in the 1830s and where, in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Colonel Sartoris shoots Joanna Burden's ancestors during Reconstruction.  (By the way, in <em>The Town</em>, the Episcopal church is referred to as the oldest extant building in Jefferson - Faulkner is nothing if not inconsistent.)</p>

"009","Compson Place","","","","","","","<p>Best known as decaying, haunted mansion from <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, the Compson place began as a prosperous antebellum slave plantation on a square mile of land so near the settlement of Jefferson that the property is eventually incorporated into the town.  The ""Appendix"" that Faulkner wrote sixteen years after the novel notes the plantation's ""slavequarters and stables and kitchengardens,"" ""formal lawns and promenades and pavilions,"" and a ""columned porticoed house"" designed by an architect and furnished from France (328).  That ""Appendix"" sums up the longer story of its decline from this grandeur into a mid-20th century housing development consisting of ""row after row of small crowded jerrybuilt individuallyowned demiurban bungalows"" (331).  In the Snopes trilogy it turns out that Flem is behind this last stage in the fall of the house (see <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>), but even by the late 19th century and the childhood of the Compson children the path of its decline is clear.

"010","Coldfield House","","","","","","","<p>The Coldfield residence in Jefferson is small, with ""two storeys"" (6) and one of the more famous attics in American fiction. During Rosa's childhood in the 1850s it was a ""dim grim tight little house"" (55), but doubtless well-maintained, with its ""brick walk"" (36) and ""small, grimly middleclass yard or lawn"" (15). By 1909, when Quentin Compson spends an afternoon with her in the ""dim hot airless room"" that she calls the ""office because her father called it that"" (3), the house is ""unpainted and a little shabby"" (6), and although there is still a ""carriage"" in the ""barn"" in the back, there is no longer a horse to pull it (15).

Now Joanna, the last surviving member of the family, lives there alone, ""in a lonely house in a neighborhood populated, when at all, by negroes"" (258).  The entire property has fallen into decay even before the big house burns to the ground.  When Byron Bunch looks over it near the end of the novel he sees that ""the plantation is broken now by random negro cabins and garden patches and dead fields erosiongutted and choked with blackjack and sassafras and persimmon and brier"" - though the stately oaks that shade the plantation's mansion house ""still stand"" (425).</p>

Maples, crepe myrtle, syringea, and althea grow in the small yard. On the corner of the yard is an old sign, ""three feet long and eighteen inches high,"" which advertises art lessons, hand-painted greeting cards, and photograph developing (58).  Faulkner's working title for the novel was ""The Dark House,"" but it's not known whether he meant this house or the equally dark house in which Joanna Burden lives - or perhaps another place entirely.

"014","Jefferson Cemetery","Faulkner map","<p>The public cemetery on the edge of Jefferson is one of the busiest places in Faulkner's imagination.  Both his first Yoknapatawpha novel, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, and (almost three decades later) the second volume in the Snopes Trilogy, <em>The Town</em>, basically end there.  This is the cemetery to which Benjy Compson is being taken - though he does not get there - at the end of Faulkner's second Yoknapatawpha novel, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, and to which the Bundren family are taking the body of Addie through most of the third one, <em>As I Lay Dying</em>.  Altogether it appears in eight novels and four short stories.  It is landscaped with ""pointed cedars and doves and serene marble shapes"" (<em>Flags in the Dust</em>, 173) - or as the narrator of ""A Rose for Emily"" puts it, it is ""cedar-bemused"" (<em>Collected Stories</em>, 119).  It seems entirely non-denominational; even Yankee soldiers are buried there, alongside Confederate ones.  On the other hand, like almost everything in Yoknapatawpha, it is racially segregated.  For example, the deceased members of the Sartoris family lie together around the imposing statue of Colonel John in the cemetery's ""whitefolks section,"" but the head of the family that lives with the Sartorises for generations and serves them as slaves and then servants is buried in ""the negro ground"" outside ""the cemetery proper""; his grave is marked by ""tedious rows of broken gaudy bits of crockery and colored glass"" (<em>Flags</em>, 396-97).

Eck's neck brace isn't the most bizarre item in the cemetery; that has to be the hand of the outlaw Grumby, which is cut off and wired to Rosa Millard's make-shift tombstone by Bayard and Ringo, the two boys who called her ""Granny"" in <em>The Unvanquished</em>.</p>

"015","Jefferson Cemetery Monuments","","","","","","","<p>Eventually there are two recognizable 'monuments' in the Jefferson public cemetery.  The first appears in the first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  Colonel John Sartoris' imposing ""effigy and statue"" stands tall on a height overlooking the railroad he built, wearing a frock coat and an expression described as that ""haughty arrogance which repeated itself generation after generation with a fateful fidelity"" (399). There seems to be no question but that Faulkner based it on the statue of his great-grandfather, William C. Falkner, in the cemetery at Ripley, Mississippi.  This statue only appears in this one text, but here Faulkner gives it a significant role to play.  The car accident, for example, in which young Bayard Sartoris is responsible for the death of his grandfather, old Bayard, the Colonel's son, occurs ""directly"" under ""John Sartoris' effigy"" with ""its florid stone gesture"" (326), and the Colonel's sister's visit to the cemetery near the end of the novel provides an occasion to describe the statue, and quote its inscription, and sound the elegiac note on which <em>Flags</em> closes (399).  At the other end of Faulkner's career, in the last two volumes of the Snopes trilogy, another monument is erected in this cemetery.  It's paid for by Flem Snopes, who is in many ways the Sartorises' antithesis, and if there are good reasons to question the heroic claims made by the Colonel's statue and its epitaph - ""For man's enlightenment he lived,"" etc. (<em>Flags</em>, 399) - the tribute Flem pays to his wife Eula on her monument - ""A virtuous Wife is a Crown to her Husband,"" etc. (<em>The Town</em>, 372) - is preposterous.  But the marble ""medallion"" of Eula's face that her daughter Linda and her would-be knight Gavin Stevens have had made in Italy and then affixed to the marble ""monument"" that Flem erected is clearly meant to evoke the kind of great passions associated with tragic loss (366).  To quote what V.K. Suratt says about it in <em>The Mansion</em>: ""that face that even if it was carved outen dead stone, was still the same face that ever young man no matter how old he got would still never give up hope and belief that some day before he died he would finally be worthy to be wrecked and ruined and maybe even destroyed by it"" (165-66).</p>

"017","Sutpen Plantation","","","","","","","<p>Sutpen's plantation has its origins in both Gothic fiction and Southern history.  It first appears in the short story ""Wash,"" where there is nothing to distinguish it from other Yoknapatawpha plantations with a ""big house"" and slaves (537).  In the novel <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, though, it becomes ""Sutpen's Hundred,"" the ""biggest single"" cotton plantation in antebellum Yoknapatawpha (56), ""a hundred square miles of some of the best virgin bottom land in the country"" (26).  Realistically, even in the context of Faulkner's imaginary world Yoknapatawpha would have to be a lot larger to contain a plantation of that size, but the obvious effect Faulkner is after is 'bigness.' In the novel the story of the plantation, from its beginnings in the 1830s to its decay and eventual destruction in the early 20th century, is a synecdoche for the story of the South. At the very moment that the Civil War begins, Sutpen's Hundred is at the height of its prosperity.  By the time Quentin Compson visits it and its ghosts on a dark summer night in 1909, the huge mansion - the ""largest edifice"" in the county, ""bigger than the courthouse"" (30), furnished with ""crystal chandeliers"" (33) and embellished with details like its ""formal door beneath its fanlight imported pane by pane from Europe"" (150) - ""looms"" like Poe's 'House of Usher': ""square and enormous, with jagged half-toppled chimneys"" and a ""sagging"" roofline, ""with a smell of desolation and decay as if the wood of which it was built were flesh"" (293).  And by the end of the novel it's consumed in a fire that was started by one of Sutpen's own children, ironically to protect another of his children - both of whom perish with the house.  As a plantation, it was originally worked by slaves; it is drastically reduced in size after the Civil War, when ""a portion of the Sutpen plantation"" is farmed ""on shares"" by Sutpen's own, unrecognized, grandson (169); still later the entire property ""reverts to the state,"" and is ""bought and sold and bought and sold again and again and again"" (173).  The other locations on the property described in the novel - the garden, the arbor, the gate and drive, the stable, the slave quarters, the graveyard and the store Sutpen opens - have their own Location entries in this index.</p>

"018","Fishing Camp|Hunting Camp","","","","","","","<p>This camp in the wilderness on the southern side of the Tallahatchie River appears in a dozen different fictions, and is the scene of a number of major events - including the deaths of six human characters and a dog named Lion.  It first appears as the old shack where Wash lives with his granddaughter in ""Wash,"" which describes it memorably as ""a crazy shack on a slough in the river bottom on the Sutpen place, which Sutpen had built for a fishing lodge in his bachelor days and which had since fallen in dilapidation from disuse, so that now it looked like an aged or sick wild beast crawled terrifically there to drink in the act of dying"" (536).  Wash and Sutpen are two of the people who die there, in a violent event that also provides <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> with one of its climactic horrors. In the other ten texts the camp belongs to Major de Spain, who converts it to a hunting camp which is described in increasingly elaborate terms.  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> it is ""a paintless six-room bungalow set on piles above the spring high-water"" (184).  ""A Bear Hunt"" mentions the detached kitchen where the hunters' Negro servants eat and prepare meals for the white men. In Faulkner's last novel, <em>The Reivers</em>, around ""the lodge"" are also ""stables and kennels"" for the mules, horses and dogs (18).  In the hunting stories it often feels like a place to escape from time and history, especially as the site where Sam Fathers initiates Ike McCaslin into the eternal values of the big woods, but chronologically it begins as the blood-stained ground on which Wash and Sutpen destroy each other, and according to Ike's thoughts in ""Delta Autumn,"" by 1940 ""the house itself no longer exists"" (274).

The other vehicle is a Ford in the first instance, and a wagon carrying a Negro family in the second.  <em>Flags</em> locates the spot close enough to the Jefferson cemetery for the grand statue of Colonel John Sartoris - the father and great-grandfather of these two Bayards - to loom over the scene.

"020","MacCallum|McCallum Place","","","","","","","<p>This spot is one of those Yoknapatawpha locations that changes dramatically, depending on Faulkner's imaginative concerns at different points in his career. On Faulkner's two maps of Yoknapatawpha the spot is home to two families, with three different names: the MacCallums (in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>), whose name is spelled McCallum in two later texts; and the McCaslins (in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> and elsewhere).  As the MacCallum|McCallum place, it was built in 1866 by Virginius MacCallum; as the McCaslin place it has its own location entry, but it's significant that in that incarnation the spot is the site of a large antebellum slave plantation.  There is no taint of slavery associated with the MacCallum|McCallum property.  They are identified as yeoman farmers rather than planters, and associated with hunting and making moonshine.  In <em>Flags</em> the farmland is largely neglected; in ""The Tall Men"" it is still being worked by the sons of Anse - as Virginius is called in the short story.  In both these texts and ""Knight's Gambit"" the place provides a kind of refuge from modernity as a locus of traditional virtues like independence, courage and loyalty.  Ike McCaslin - who is morally compelled to renounce the McCaslin place in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> - would have felt a lot more at 'home' at the McCallums'.</p>

"021","Varner's Store","","","","","","","<p>Varner's country store is the established center of both the economic and social life of Frenchman's Bend, the hamlet usually located about twenty miles southeast of Jefferson.  It is one of the many properties owned by Will Varner, for whom many of the Bend's inhabitants work as tenants on small farms he also owns.  Since it is the only store in the area, and owned by the man they rent from, these 'sharecroppers' are expected to buy all their supplies and necessities there.  The tenantry system emerged during Reconstruction, and among its dire economic effects was the fact that during the year tenants became the landlord's debtors as well as his unpaid laborers, acquiring what <em>The Mansion</em> calls a ""furnish bill"" from the store (310).  When tenants finally brought in their cotton or corn in the fall, they owed the landlord both his large share of the crop and also that debt, with accrued interest. In <em>The Hamlet</em> Faulkner describes Varner ""making his yearly settlement with his tenants and debtors"" (67).  Socially, the store's front porch  - or 'gallery' - is where the men of the Bend regularly gather to talk when they aren't working their farms.  In <em>The Town</em> Gavin Stevens provides a description of the contents of the store: ""the racks of hames and plow-handles, the rank side meat and flour and cheap molasses and cheese and shoes and coal oil and work gloves and snuff and chewing tobacco and fly-specked candy"" (307).  Varner's is one of many such stores in Yoknapatawpha, but the one that appears most frequently in the fictions (eighteen altogether), in part because it is also the first rung on the ladder of upward mobility for Flem Snopes, who leaves the life of a sharecropper's son behind by getting hired as the store's clerk by Will's son Jody.</p>

"022","Grenier Plantation|Old Frenchman Place","","","","","","","<p>The 'old Frenchman place' is the third plantation 'big house' Faulkner creates.  The first - Sartoris in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> - is still intact and prosperous over half a century after the Civil War.  The second - the Compson place in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> - is falling into decay by then.  The old Frenchman place has already fallen by the time it first appears, in <em>Sanctuary</em>.  The novel actually describes it as if for the first time twice, from Gavin Stevens' point of view and then from Temple Drake's.  The ""gutted"" and ""gaunt weather-stained ruin"" of an antebellum mansion they both see (8, 41) serves Faulkner's imagination as the appropriate setting for a very Gothic tale, a sinister place defined by mobsters, murder and rape.  It re-appears in ten more fictions, and in the process gets located more clearly in the context of Southern history. The old Frenchman was one of Yoknapatawpha county's original white settlers, and his place the county's ""first big land patent,"" a slave plantation originally so ""vast"" that half of it was ""not even in Yoknapatawpha County"" (<em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, 6, 8).  Its ""tremendous house"" was designed by an ""imported and nameless architect""; no longer habitable, it has been reduced to a ""broken roof and topless chimneys and one high rectangle of window through which [one can] see the stars"" (<em>The Hamlet</em>, 375).  Since the Civil War the small farmers who live in Frenchman's Bend have been tearing it apart to use the wood as fuel.  In the Snopes trilogy, Flem Snopes acquires it when he marries Eula Varner.  Reputedly, the old Frenchman's silver is still buried somewhere on the property, which gives Flem a fraudulent way to use the remains of the house to climb another rung on the ladder that ultimately leads to a different 'mansion' in Jefferson.  This is one of those pieces of unreal estate in Yoknapatawpha that moves around: in earlier editions of <em>Sanctuary</em> the place is located ""twenty miles from town,"" but Polk's corrected text puts the distance at ""twelve miles"" (121).</p>

"023","Bundrens' Farm","","","","","","","<p>In her section of <em>As I Lay Dying</em> Addie remembers the first time she met Anse, and mentioned his ""good farm"" (171).  Apparently that and his ""new house"" are important factors in her decision to marry him.  There's no suggestion in the novel that the Bundrens are sharecroppers - i.e. they own the farm and its fields - but like many of the other small cotton farmers in their part of Yoknapatawpha it's clear that they have to struggle for subsistence.  Physically, the Bundren farm sits below the bluff that the house is built on top of.   It features a cotton field with a path that ""runs straight as a plumb-line"" through the cotton rows toward the cottonhouse ""of rough logs, from between which the chinking has fallen.  Square, with a broken roof set at a single pitch, it leans in empty and shimmering dilapidation in the sunlight, a single broad window in two opposite walls giving onto the approach of the path"" (4).   On one side of the field are woods, and on the other, next to the path that leads up to the house, a road.  The farm also features a barn, wagon shed, pasture, and spring, all located at the bottom of the bluff.  We assume that the Mrs. Bundren who lives ""up past Whiteleaf"" in ""Spotted Horses"" is Addie - or in any case someone who lives on this farm too (174).</p>

On the map of the county that Faulkner himself drew in 1936, Tull's farm is located north of the Yoknapatawpha River, and northeast of Frenchman's Bend; this is where it seems to be located in ""Shingles for the Lord,"" published in 1943.  In two earlier novels, however, it seems to be in two other places in the Frenchman's Bend part of the county.  In <em>As I Lay Dying</em> (1930) it clearly lies along the southern bank of the river, and is connected to Frenchman's Bend by a bridge.  And in <em>Sanctuary</em> (1931) it is the nearest neighbor to the old Frenchman place, which would put it at least two miles away from the spot it occupies on the map.

On his 1936 map of Yoknapatawpha Faulkner himself locates ""Armstid's"" in the hills to the northeast of Frenchman's Bend.  According to ""Spotted Horses"" (1931) the Armstid farm is ""about four miles"" from Varner's store (178), though that text doesn't say in which direction.  In three contemporaneous texts that question is answered in three different ways.  In <em>As I Lay Dying</em> (1931), where the farm first appears, the Armstids live south of the Bend, on the north side of and very close to the river; the farm features a house, a barn, and a shed where the Bundren family stays overnight.  A year later the farm appears again in two other fictions: in <em>Light in August</em> it's the place on the road into the Bend from the northeast where Lena Grove spends her first night in Yoknapatawpha; and in ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard,"" where the brief description of their ""small mortgaged farm"" on which they make ""less than a bare living"" from the soil, it seems directly north of the Bend (142).</p>

Reached by a lane that goes past Tull's house and barn, the bridge was built in 1888.  In the novel it is largely submerged in the flooded river: ""mid-sunk,"" with ""logs and such drifting up over it and it swagging and shivering like the whole thing would go any minute"" (124).  Half of the Bundrens cross it on foot, while the other half try to carry Addy's corpse over the river in a wagon on the ford that people used to cross the river before 1888.  As a setting these crossings are both realistically described - Cash, for example, mentions ""them two big whiteoaks"" people used to use line up the path of the ford (142) - and symbolically resonant: Darl, for example, describes the moving water as ""silent, impermanent and profoundly significant"" (141), and the big log that knocks the wagon off the ford stands up out of the water ""upright upon that surging and heaving desolation like Christ"" (148).</p>

"028","McCaslin-Edmonds Place","","","","","","","<p>Some seventeen miles northeast of Jefferson stands the McCaslin-Edmonds house, which has the longest history of any of the structures in Yoknapatawpha, although its exact age varies in different texts.  According to Faulkner's last novel, <em>The Reivers</em>, the house was built in 1813 by Old Carothers McCaslin, and it is still there at the center of a working plantation in 1961, though the enslaved people who once lived in the slave quarters have been replaced Negro domestics and sharecroppers who live in the ""servant and tenant quarters"" (<em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, 8).  On the other hand, the earlier <em>Go Down, Moses</em> implies the house (and Carothers) were in Yoknapatawpha before 1807.  The texts also disagree, even within themselves, about the kind of house Carothers built.  Near the beginning of <em>Moses</em> it's described as a ""log"" structure with ""two wings,"" which after the Civil War was transformed by Cass Edmonds (Carothers' great-grandson) into a more conventional plantation big house, ""portico"" and all (44); near the end of that novel, however, the narrator calls Carothers' original house a ""vast [unfinished] cavern"" (286).  <em>The Reivers</em> offers a slightly different but more consistent account; there the original ""two-room mud-chinked log half domicile and half fort"" has been repeatedly enlarged and covered over by ""the clapboards and Greek revival and steamboat scrollwork"" which the women who marry into the Edmonds family have added over the decades (61).  This gentrification of the place is only one of the ways it morphs over time - that is, over the course of Faulkner's career.  According to <em>The Unvanquished</em> it was pretty genteel from the beginning: what that first McCaslin built was not a log cabin but a ""big colonial house,"" ""one of the finest [residences] in the country,"" before Old Carothers' sons decided to move all the slaves they inherited along with the land into ""the manor house,"" choosing to live themselves in a cabin they built nearby (47).  According to <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Old Carothers' grandson Ike is even more uncomfortable with the property's slave-owning past, so although he is slated to inherit it some years after Emancipation he instead renounces his claim, which is how the Edmondses who descend from Carothers' daughter come to own it.  As Ike discovers in <em>Moses</em>, the plantation is ""cursed"" by the monstrous sin his grandfather committed there before he was  born (283).  In that novel the legacy of this sin lives on through the generations - though notably, no reference to that particular past is made in the other eight texts in which the property appears or is mentioned.  And Faulkner's various accounts of the place raise further questions. For example, in <em>The Hamlet</em> Flem Snopes' family spends a winter at Ike McCaslin's ""farm"" (390), but Ike never owns the property and nowhere else is it called a farm.  And Faulkner's reference in his last fiction to the original ""log"" house connects the place back to the MacCallum home that stands on the same spot on Faulkner's first map of Yoknapatawpha as the McCaslins' place occupies on his second - but the MacCallum place is in the hills, while the McCaslin place sits on the rich bottom land near the river.  The way Faulkner's imagination keeps returning to and re-creating this spot is a sign that for him it's one of the places in his world onto which he can project and seek to resolve his own conflicted feelings about the larger Southern past.</p>

But garages and cotton gins had encroached and obliterated even the august names of that neighborhood; only Miss Emily's house was left, lifting its stubborn and coquettish decay above the cotton wagons and gasoline pumps - an eyesore among eyesores"" (119).  At one point it also offends the noses of the people in the neighborhood.  Geographically, we can't be sure about exactly where it stands in Jefferson.

"030","Yoknapatawpha Airfield","","","","","","","<p>This airfield became a Yoknapatawpha location when Malcolm Cowley decided to include the story ""Death Drag"" in his 1946 <em>Viking Portable</em> collection of Faulkner's works, and recruited Faulkner to prepare a map like the one he had drawn ten years earlier for <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> for inclusion in the book.  The text of the story itself gives no hint that it takes place in the county.  On his 1946 map, Faulkner places the ""Airport,"" as he labels it, slightly south and east of Jefferson alongside the road that runs to Mottstown.  ""Airport""  is also the word the story's narrator uses the first time he mentions the location (185). But the rest of the time the narrative refers to it as the ""field"" (186), and that is a much more accurate word. As the narrator acknowledges, Jefferson's airfield is ""still in an embryonic state"": a regraded cotton field ""with an X-shaped runway into the prevailing winds"" (186). The working farm on one side and the ""grove of trees"" on the other often make clearance difficult for the few planes that take off or land there.  (Curiously, in the later novel <em>The Mansion</em> there is some talk about the U.S. government building a military airfield near this spot, but that may just be a ploy by Flem Snopes to fleece Jason Compson - in any case, ""Death Drag"" is the only text in which you can land a plane in Yoknapatawpha.)</p>

"031","Old Man’s Birthplace","","","","","","","<p>The map Faulkner drew for Malcolm Cowley's 1946 collection of his work, <em>The Portable Faulkner</em>, includes a caption (but not an actual location) in the southeast corner of Yoknapatawpha for ""OLD MAN Here was born the convict & grew a man & sinned & was transported for the rest of his life to pay for it.""  Faulkner knew Cowley's selection of texts included the ""Old Man"" chapters from <em>The Wild Palms</em>.  He clearly sought to put all the fictions in <em>The Portable</em> on the map he was making, but there is no mention of either the convict's birth or Yoknapatawpha in the story, nor does the other narrative in <em>The Wild Palms</em> have any connection to Yoknapatawpha.  So the text is not in Digital Yoknapatawpha nor his birthplace on any of the maps created for the project, but since one of Faulkner's two maps of his mythical county mentions ""Old Man"" as one of the seventeen texts it plots, we include this entry in the index.  We do include the short story ""Death Drag,"" the other text in Cowley's collection with problematic credentials as a Yoknapatawpha fiction, but for two reasons.  First, the unnamed town in that story <em>could</em> be Jefferson.  More importantly, in the novella ""Knight's Gambit,"" written soon after Cowley's book appeared, Faulkner goes out of his way to add the World War I veteran Captain Warren, one of the major characters in ""Death Drag,"" to the census of Yoknapatawpha characters, with a farm a few miles outside Jefferson.  He never does anything similar to bring ""Old Man"" or the convict into the Yoknapatawpha saga.</p>

In the first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Doctor Peabody shares it with a new-comer, Doctor Alford, and the narrative uses the difference between Alford's antiseptic examination room and the warm clutter of Peabody's office as another marker of the distance between the Old and New Souths.  <em>As I Lay Dying</em> includes a reference to ""Alford's office"" ""upstairs"" above the drugstore (241), although in that novel it is in Peabody's office that Cash Bundren's broken leg is reset.  And after <em>As I Lay Dying</em> the only office ever referred to is Peabody's: it is where the Negro woman Boon shoots in <em>The Reivers</em> is treated, and Pap, in ""Fool about a Horse,"" buys a ""pint of whiskey"" (129).  Yoknapatawpha, like all of Mississippi during Faulkner's time, was dry, but it seems a doctor can dispense alcohol for medical purposes; Pap even calls the office ""Doc Peabody's store.""  In two late novels Faulkner gives Peabody's office a specific location on the Square: above Christian's drugstore.  We assume that it is also in Peabody's office that Benjy Compson is castrated in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, but the novel's reference to that operation is extremely vague.</p>

The narrator of <em>Flags</em> describes it as ""smooth . . . and winding"" (142), as it descends from the town, crosses the valley with ""cultivated fields"" along both sides, then rises into the ""shimmering hills"" to the north (218).  In ""Knight's Gambit"" it is ""still just a country road"" in 1940, graveled but not paved.  The description of it in that short story is particularly rich: ""And it (the road) was older than gravel too, running back into the old time of simple dirt red and curving among the hills, then straight and black where the rich land flattened, alluvial and fertile; niggard in width since the land was too rich, too fecund in corn and cotton, to allow room for men to pass one another almost, marked only by the thin iron of carriage- and wagon-rims and the open O's of horses and mules"" (241).

In the later novel there's no ambiguity about the location of the bridge over the Nine-Mile Branch: it's name measures its distance from Jefferson and Lucas Beauchamp gives Chick Mallison very specific directions to get to it.  But while the route over which the two Negroes take the injured Bayard to Sartoris is described in enough detail (216-19) to make it clear that that novel's ""creek . . . beneath a stone bridge"" is in the northeastern part of Yoknapatawpha (213) and somewhere close to the site of the Nine-Mile Branch, there's no way to know for sure if Faulkner was imagining the two places as occupying the same spot on his own evolving map of the county.  There are many similarities in his descriptions of the two locations (compare <em>Flags</em>, 213ff, with <em>Intruder</em>, 146ff); it has to be acknowledged, however, that our conflation of them is conjectural.</p>

"039","Jefferson Railroad Station","","","","","","","<p>Jefferson's railroad station is the main portal through which the county is connected to the larger world, and it appears as a location in 22 different texts.  <em>Go Down, Moses</em> notes that it lies at the bottom of a  ""long hill"" that runs ""up from the station"" to the Square (363).  <em>The Unvanquished</em> depicts the arrival of the first train at it not long after the end of the Civil War, with Colonel John Sartoris - who was largely responsible for constructing the rail line that runs north-south through the middle of the county - driving the engine and ""blowing blast after blast"" on the whistle (225-26).  For over five decades the station is a major site in the town's life.  When Mink Snopes travels from Frenchman's Bend to Jefferson in 1908 in <em>The Mansion</em>, he ""spends the night"" at the station in order to see trains, and notes that the platform is crowded with ""men and boys come down to see the train pass"" (38). However, later in that novel Chick Mallison notes that ""by 1937 it had been a year or so since a train had passed through Jefferson that a paid passenger could have got off of"" (199), and by the novel's end the railroad itself has become ""a fading weed-grown branch line knowing no wheels anymore save two local freight trains more or less every day"" (446).

It has a number of different owners over the course of the 9 texts it appears in, including Manfred de Spain, who in <em>The Town</em> inherits the livery stable from his father, ""sells the horses,"" ""tears out the stalls and cribs and tack-rooms and establishes the first garage and automobile agency in Jefferson"" (14).  This would have been early in the 20th century, though in Faulkner's last book, <em>The Reivers</em>, set in 1905, it is ""Maury Priest's livery stable"" and still doing a very thriving business (11).

Only two texts identify a specific rural location as the family's origin point.  In <em>As I Lay Dying</em> the Snopes farm somewhere near Varner's store is where Jewel both acquires his horse (sometime before the novel begins) and loses it, after Anse goes there to swap the horse away as part of his negotiation with someone named Snopes for a new team of mules.  If this Snopes' first name is either Ab or Flem, Faulkner here locates the Snopes family's rural background as a more settled and prosperous than in any other text, since this Snopes has at least one hired hand and more than one pair of mules on the farm.  More consistent with Faulkner's typical representation of the family, the narrator of ""Spotted Horses"" refers to ""a regular nest"" of Snopeses who live and work as tenant farmers - that is, sharecroppers - ""about five miles down the bottom,"" which seems to mean five miles from Varner's store, closer to the river (165).  The word ""nest"" tells us something about how this narrator feels about Snopeses - he almost certainly means a nest of snakes, not birds - but very little about the actual place these Snopeses live, though presumably it is a farm or group of farms.</p>

One of Ab's daughters proclaims that the cabin ""likely ain't fit for hawgs"" (9); when Ratliff retells this story in <em>The Hamlet</em>, it is Ab himself who says that (15).  There are two beds, but three of Ab's children and his sister-in-law sleep ""on pallets on the floor"" (14).</p>

"053","De Spain Mansion","","","","","","","<p>The De Spains, father and son, appear often enough in Faulkner's fictions and the history of Yoknapatawpha to make the family one of the county's more important ones.  And the mansion that the father builds and in which his son lives until the end of <em>The Town</em>, when Flem Snopes moves in, is <em>the</em> mansion in the title of the last volume in the Snopes trilogy.  But unlike the other big houses that Faulkner plots on his maps - the Sartorises, the Compsons, Sutpen's and so on - he moves the De Spain place around a lot.  In some texts, like ""Barn Burning"" and <em>The Hamlet</em>, it's at the center of a plantation someplace in the county, but in others, like ""Shall Not Perish"" and <em>The Mansion</em>, it's pretty clearly inside the town of Jefferson.  And the character of the house itself changes between texts.  When Faulkner wants to emphasize the difference between the old aristocratic values of Major de Spain and the parvenu tastelessness of the Snopeses in <em>The Mansion</em> before Flem acquires it, the house was ""jest a house: two storey, with a gallery [porch] for Major de Spain, Manfred's paw, to set on"" (170).  But when Flem takes it over, his desire to make it into a ""physical symbol of . . . generations of respectability and aristocracy"" overreaches itself: he hires a family member, Wat Snopes, turn it into a more stately mansion with ""colyms to reach all the way from the ground up to the second storey roof"" (171) and  even ""fireplaces"" with ""colonial molding and colyums and cornices too"" (173), all inspired by a ""picture in a magazine.""  Yet long before it falls into Flem's hands, Faulkner depicts the mansion as far more grand than that ""two storey"" house.  Both Sarty Snopes (in ""Barn Burning"") and the young son of Mrs. Grier (in ""Shall Not Perish"") are in awe the first time they see it.  Sarty associates its magnificence with ""peace and dignity,"" and his hopes for a better world than the one his father Ab keeps dragging him around in (10).  To the Grier boy, the mansion is ""bigger than the courthouse,"" with a yard ""bigger than the farms I had seen"" (106).  In the first of these stories, on the other hand, Ab interprets the splendor of the big house very differently, thinking of the human lives that have been exploited to provide the De Spains with their wealth: ""Pretty and white, ain't it?"" he says to Sarty; ""That's sweat. Nigger sweat"" (32).  As an artist, Faulkner can hold each of these other 'two storeys' in his imagination, can appreciate the truth of Ab's proletarian critique of the Southern landed class <em>and also</em> believe that when Ab's son Flem takes possession of the mansion it is a usurpation.</p>

"054","Jefferson Courthouse and Square","","","","","","","<p>""The courthouse: the center, the focus, the hub"" (<em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, 32) - one way or another the courthouse and the Square around it that are at the center of Jefferson appear in over two-thirds of the fictions. (The ""Square"" or the ""square"" - Faulkner's texts write it both ways, sometimes even inside the same text; see ""Knight's Gambit,"" 199 vs 210.) The various descriptions of the ""by-neo-Greek-out-of-Georgian-England"" courthouse building (<em>Requiem</em>, 167) align very closely with the design of the actual Lafayette County courthouse in the middle of Oxford's central square, and although the story of the Yoknapatawpha courthouse varies a bit from text to text, it too stays close to history.  <em>Requiem</em>, where the first act is entitled ""The Courthouse,"" provides the fullest account of its building in the years before the Civil War, according to a design provided by the same French architect who created Thomas Sutpen's plantation.  Several texts mention how ""the courthouse and everything else on or in the Square was burned to rubble by Federal occupation forces after a battle in 1864"" (<em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, 48-49); curiously, Faulkner refers to but never describes the burning of Jefferson, and only once describes its aftermath in any detail, when Bayard and Ringo ""ride past the brick piles and the sooty walls that hadn't fallen down yet, and went on through what used to be the square"" at the end of ""Vendee"" (<em>The Unvanquished</em>, 184).  Like Colonel Sartoris' plantation, however, also burned down by the Yankees, the courthouse and the stores on the Square soon rose again.  The four clocks on the courthouse, one facing in each cardinal direction, play a role in many stories - sometimes a symbolic role, not surprisingly in an author as interested in 'time' as Faulkner: one such moment occurs in that most time-obsessed novel of all, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, when Jason Compson thinks bitterly about the pigeon droppings that have to be cleaned out of those clocks ""every year"" (247).  The inside of the courthouse contains different offices in different stories, including the ""the Chancery Clerk's books"" which record the transferrals of the land in Yoknapatawpha from the Indians to the white settlers (""The Old People,"" 204) and the ordinance prohibiting motor vehicles within the city enacted by Bayard Sartoris at the dawn of the automobile age, ""copied out on a piece of parchment like a diploma or a citation and framed and hung on the wall"" by Mayor de Spain in an irreverent mood (14).  Eula Varner and Flem Snopes are among the couples who get married there.  Seven different trials take place inside the building's courtroom, including Mink Snopes', which is described in all three novels in the Snopes trilogy, and Nancy Mannigoe's, which provides the dramatic curtain raiser for <em>Requiem</em>.   Outside, on the streets on the Square, much more of Yoknapatawpha's story takes place.  These include large-scale happenings like the potential lynch mobs that gather there in <em>Light in August</em> and <em>Intruder</em>.  But much of the county's personal dramas are enacted in this public place as well; it's on the Square that Miss Emily is seen riding with Homer Barron, for example, or Chick Mallison sees Eula for both the first time and then, years later, the last time.  To the many ways that Faulkner uses the courthouse and square as a stage, we add one of our own.  Our project's programming requires that every textual Event take place at a Location.  But a great many events in the fictions occur at undefined places in Jefferson.  Whenever this happens, we 'locate' the event here, in the center of the town at the center of the county; so, for example, this is the Location where, in ""Monk,"" Monk is tried for murder <em>and</em> the place ""about town"" where Monk is often seen in his ""cheap, bright town clothes"" (46).  We also use this Location to define the place where a story's first-person narrator is telling the tale, unless the story identifies such a place itself; this includes, for example, the Location we assign ""the town"" in <em>Light in August</em> when ""they tell Byron"" the story of Gail Hightower's experience in Jefferson (60-73).  (To disambiguate these various instances you can search the 49 texts that use this Location by these different ""Types"": ""Courthouse|Trial,"" ""Courthouse|Office,"" ""Courthouse and Square,"" and ""Jefferson Event"" .)</p>

"055","Europe in World War I","","","","","","","<p>As Gavin Stevens says in <em>The Mansion</em>, the 'Great War' - as World War I was called before the second World War - ""killed eight million human beings and ruined a forty-mile wide strip down the middle of western Europe"" (178).  According to ""Knight's Gambit,"" Gavin served for ""three years as a stretcher-bearer in the French army"" (154), and in that story gives his nephew a pretty grim description of what the war was like for both the soldiers in the trenches (""the groundling"") and ""the airman"" who fought in the skies above them: ""a four-year tunnel of blood and excrement and fear"" (242-43).  World War I is regularly cited as the defining historical event for many writers of Faulkner's generation, and although he himself never got closer to the Western Front than a training base in Canada, his imagination returned to the war throughout his career.  Although <em>A Fable</em> - his 1954 novel set inside the war - isn't part of the story of Yokanapatawpha, two early stories featuring the Sartoris twins (""Ad Astra"" and ""All the Dead Pilots"") take place in war-time France; the 14 locations described in these texts have their own entries in the index.  The war, and especially the combat death of his twin brother Johnny, is the particular past that haunts Bayard Sartoris in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  Bayard describes that death, and the revenge he takes on the German pilot who shot Johnny town, for two different audiences; Narcissa Benbow, in the second such moment, is horrified by his account  (43, 257-59).  But otherwise that novel represents the war in very stylized terms: ""Man became amphibious and lived in mud and filth"" (71); ""a meteoric violence . . . beyond heaven or hell and partaking of both"" (123); ""an imminent but incomprehensible nightmare"" (341).  ""Were you in the war?"" one of the children who follow the barnstormers in ""Death Drag"" asks more than once (188, 189).  One of them was, as was a local man - each carries wounds from their experience of ""the front in '17"" (193).  Altogether this war is mentioned in 12 Yoknapatawpha texts, twice as often as World War II.  Interestingly, both <em>Flags</em> and the much later <em>Mansion</em> include characters who are clearly lying about their war-time experiences.</p>

"056","Frenchman's Bend","","","","","","","<p>Frenchman's Bend - the 'hamlet' in the title of the first novel in the Snopes trilogy - is used as a setting or is mentioned often in the Yoknapatawpha fictions.  It's a very rural community usually located twenty miles southeast of Jefferson, though Faulkner isn't consistent about the distance.  Its population is almost entirely white. It gets at least part of its name from Louis Grenier, the Frenchman who established the first slave plantation in Yoknapatawpha but who disappeared after the Civil War, so that now the residents of the Bend don't even know the 'old Frenchman's' name.  Faulkner never says whether the 'Bend' in the name refers to the road that runs through the hamlet or to the fact that, as several fictions note, when he created his plantation Grenier used slave labor to straighten a bend on the Yoknapatawpha River.  Throughout the fictions the man who owns much of Frenchman's Bend is Will Varner, and many of the other residents are tenant farmers on properties he owns; a number of the other small farms around the Bend, however, are owned by the families that work them. The narrator of <em>The Hamlet</em> describes the area this way:  ""Besides Varner's store and cotton gin and the combined grist mill and blacksmith shop which they rented to the actual smith, and the schoolhouse and the church and the perhaps three dozen dwellings within sound of both bells, the village consisted of a livery barn and lot and a contiguous shady grassless yard in which sat a sprawling rambling edifice . . . known as Littlejohn's hotel"" (31).  The Bend is perhaps best known in the larger Yoknapatawpha narrative as the place from which the Snopeses keep coming.  Many separate Bend locations have their own entries in this index, including the 28 the appear in <em>The Hamlet</em>.</p>

The Colonel's troop was moving north, after serving with Confederate General Van Dorn to keep an eye on U. S. Grant's forces in Grenada. Both Calhoun and Grenada are real counties in Mississippi, both southwest of the location of Yoknapatawpha, though there no major Civil War battles took place in either of them.  (When Faulkner tells this story again in ""Retreat"" and <em>The Unvanquished</em> he relocates it to a spot north of Yoknapatawpha.)

It's a new town, built around a lumber factory ""financed by eastern capital"" and run by ""as plausible and affable a set of brigands as ever stole a county"" (373). The town consists of ""mile after mile of identical frame houses with garage to match,"" and there is plenty of money there, ""like that afflatus of rank fecundity above a foul and stagnant pool"" (373). In <em>Sanctuary</em>, which begins with Horace's attempt to run away from this ""flat and rich and foul"" place (15) and ends with his defeated return to it, the town is called ""Kinston,"" and it is explicitly located on or near the Mississippi Delta.</p>

"060","Memphis, Tennessee","","","","","","","<p>Memphis is the closest city to Yoknapatawpha - as Jason Compson notes near the end of his section in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, ""I was within sixty-seven miles of there once this afternoon"" (245) - and it is the second most frequently used location in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha fictions, appearing in 34 of them altogether.  The city was founded on the Mississippi River in 1819, and about the time Jason imagined going there it had close to 200,000 inhabitants. Like all of Tennessee and Mississippi at this time, the city was racially segregated, but its large black population included, for example, Joanna Burden's attorney, E.E. Peebles, and ""Professor"" W.C. Handy, who brings his Negro orchestra to Jefferson to play at the cotillion ball (and whose ""St. Louis Blues"" provided Faulkner with the title for ""That Evening Sun""). The people of Yoknapatawpha travel there for many different reasons.  Both white and (later) black people move there for economic and social opportunities they don't have in northern Mississippi; Dilsey, for example, complains about ""them Memphis notions"" (31) that carried her son Versh away from home (though she herself ends up living in Memphis too).  Bayard Sartoris, Uncle Willy and V.K. Suratt visit medical specialists in the city.  Young Bayard Sartoris buys his sports car and I.O. Snopes his mules there.  Hunters camped in the big bottom can buy liquor there legally.  Popeye (in <em>Sanctuary</em>) and the hitman that Granby Dodge hires (in ""Smoke"") are only two of the criminals and gangsters associated with the city.  But again and again in the texts Memphis is linked to sexual misbehavior.  Jason compares his niece Quentin's promiscuous behavior to the women ""on Gayoso or Beale street,"" and there's every reason to assume that Lorraine, the Memphis woman with whom Jason has a relationship, is a prostitute (232, 307).  Reverend Gail Hightower's wife and even Narcissa Benbow go there to commit adultery, and many men seek out the white and Negro prostitutes in Memphis' famous and quasi-legal red-light district.  <em>The Mansion</em> locates that district in ""Mulberry and Gayoso and Pontotoc streets"" (68). (The locations for <em>Sanctuary</em>, ""Uncle Willy,"" ""Two Soldiers,"" <em>The Mansion</em> and <em>The Reivers</em> include three dozen separate places in the city; these have there own entries in the index.)</p>

"061","Oxford, Mississippi","","","","","","","<p>Oxford is the real town in Mississippi where Faulkner lived and wrote for most of his life, and the original on which much of his fictional 'Jefferson' is based.  The eight texts that mention Oxford by name seldom feature the town itself, though several of the separate Oxford locations in <em>Sanctuary</em> have their own entries in the database.  But even in <em>Sanctuary</em>, Oxford is important mainly as the location of the University of Mississippi; Temple Drake in that novel is only one of the several characters who matriculate there, from Charles Bon and Henry Sutpen in the 1850s through Linda Snopes and Charles Mallison in the mid-20th century.  Faulkner left the University behind when he relocated Oxford|Jefferson imaginatively to Yoknapatawpha County.  Though characters frequently travel between the two towns, Faulkner is careful to obscure the exact route they take.  In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, for instance, Bayard Sartoris travels north to get there.  In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Granny Millard says Oxford it just a few miles away from Mottstown, which is due south of Jefferson.  In <em>Sanctuary</em>, Horace Benbow has to change trains twice between Jefferson and Oxford.   And curiously, after repeatedly asserting that Oxford and Jefferson are forty miles apart, in the final two texts that mention both of them - <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em> - he makes the distance fifty miles. (See also the entry for University of Mississippi, Oxford in this index.)</p>

"062","Virginia in the Civil War","","","","","","","<p>Mississippi was in the western theater of the Civil War, but quite a few of Faulkner's characters fight in the eastern theater, perhaps so that their creator could bring the most famous Confederate generals - Lee, Jackson, Stuart - into his story of Yoknapatawpha.   The character who appears first as Virginius MacCallum and then as Anse McCallum travels to Lexington, Virginia, to enlist in Jackson's brigade, and John Sartoris and the regiment he raises from Yoknapatawpha do their fighting under Lee, though Sartoris retreats to Mississippi and fights there and in Tennessee after his men replace him in command with Sutpen.  John's brother, the first Bayard Sartoris, serves with Stuart in the War, and dies during a pointless raid near Manassas, Virginia.  That event, which is told in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, describes actual combat in more detail than any other text, and even then it is an atypical example of a Civil War battle.  There is very little direct representation of the War in the fictions, although the 7 texts that reference the fighting in Virginia mention Richmond as capital of the Confederacy, as well as First and Second Manassas|Bull Run, Jackson's Valley campaign, Chancellorsville, the Wilderness and Appomattox.</p>

The bridge is first mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>,  as the site of young John Sartoris' adventure with the fox (353).  That story, told by Rafe MacCallum, gives no clue to the location of the river or the bridge, but we assume it's the same ""Samson's bridge"" as in the other texts.</p>

"064","General Store in Grenier County","","","","","","","<p>""Barn Burning"" begins in this general store, though it's serving as the venue for the trial of Ab Snopes. The description gives a good picture of the goods such stores sell: Ab's young son Sarty, the story's focal character, sits on a keg of nails: ""from where he sat he could see the ranked shelves close-packed with the solid, squat, dynamic shapes of tin cans whose labels his stomach read, not from the lettering which meant nothing to his mind but from the scarlet devils and the silver curve of fish - this, the cheese which he knew he smelled and the hermetic meat which his intestines believed he smelled coming in intermittent gusts momentary and brief"" (3).  We locate the store south of the Yoknapatawpha River on the basis of V.K. Ratliff's account of Ab Snopes' trial in <em>The Hamlet</em>, where he says that it took place ""over in Grenier County"" (10).  Grenier is named after Louis Grenier, the 'old Frenchman' whose huge plantation was built on both the Yoknapatawpha and Grenier sides of the river.  (Faulkner apparently renames the county ""Mott"" in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, 184.)</p>

"067","Jefferson Barbershop","","","","","","","<p>In the 11 texts where it appears, the town ""barbershop"" - Faulkner seems to have spelled this as one word, though in some stories it is printed as two, and in one it is hyphenated - is identified as a very masculine environment.  It is where Quentin Compson finds Dalton Ames in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>.  It is also a place where men of different classes can mingle - it is where Horace Benbow runs into Clarence Snopes in <em>Sanctuary</em> - but more typically it is associated with the kind of men who can make no claim to respectability.  In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> it is where the town's ""young men and some not so young"" hang out, ""not only on Saturday afternoons but all the week too"" (27), and when Joe Brown quits his mill job in <em>Light in August</em> one of the mill workers says that ""his address from now on will be the barbershop"" (45). <em>Intruder</em> adds the information that many of the unmarried men who live in town take their ""Saturday and Sunday baths"" (42) in the ""bath-cabinets"" behind the shop (209), and like <em>The Mansion</em>, pairs the barbershop with the poolhall, which seems to be contiguous with it.  In the later novel, the town's ""boys"" can be heard behaving rowdily inside it ""at two oclock Sunday morning"" (203).  In ""Dry September"" Hawkshaw's barber shop is where McLendon goes to recruit a lynch mob, though Hawkshaw himself speaks out against the idea.  Hawkshaw is one of the few barbers whom Faulkner identifies by name, and he appears again in the story ""Hair,"" which as its title suggests is organized around barbershops; in it the environment is still essentially male, though the most important 'hair' in the story belongs to Susan Reed, who is presumably not the only girl or woman whose hair is cut in the shop where Hawkshaw works.</p>

"071","Brick Kiln","","","","","","","<p>Brick kilns appear in two fictions, in two very different ways.

In <em>The Town</em>, which was published a quarter century later but set at about the same chronological moment as the story, the brick kiln is where Grover Cleveland Winbush is the night watchman, which implies it is operational.  According to <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, the first bricks in Jefferson were made in the ""molds and kilns"" created by the French architect who designed and built Sutpen's mansion; these ""molds and kilns"" also produced the bricks that were used to build the courthouse, two churches and the Female Academy, but that novel does not locate them in a particular Location (177).</p>

In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>, where it's referred to as the ""poolhall"" (27, 203), it seems to be adjacent to the barbershop, and so closely connected to it in those two texts that we include the poolhall in the index entry for the Barbershop.

"073","Jefferson Drugstore","","","","","","","<p>Jefferson drugstores appear in 15 different fictions, where they often play an important role.  The drugstore is where Emily buys arsenic, Dewey Dell tries to get an abortion, a hired killer from Memphis buys a tell-tale pack of cigarettes.  Its rack of paperbacks is the town's only 'bookstore.' In <em>Sanctuary</em> the drugstore even dispenses music to the country people who stand around the doorway (112).  The soda fountain in the drugstore is a major site in the town's social life: young people regularly gather there to court each other, and it's where Gavin Stevens provides Linda Snopes with ice cream confections and avuncular wisdom.  Jason Compson stops at the soda fountain for a ""dope"" (191) and a ""shot"" (243) or a ""headache shot"" (251) - all colloquial terms for a Coca-Cola. Like doctors, drugstores in the 'dry' state of Mississippi could dispense alcohol for medicinal purposes, though this only seems to be the case in ""Dry September,"" where the soda fountain clerk supplies Minnie Cooper with liquor. Curiously, in two stories two different Negro employees of the drugstore sell moonshine whiskey they keep hidden in two different trees behind the store.  The disreputable character whose names are Skeet MacGowan, Skeets Magowan, and so on, works at the drugstore in four different texts - he's the man who promises to 'treat' Dewey Dell's condition - and even with those variations in his name, he's a more consistent link among the texts than the store's owner or pharmacist.  In the last two volumes of the Snopes trilogy Faulkner settles on ""Christian's drugstore"" as the name of the business, but originally, in ""Uncle Willy,"" Christian's is the second and even more disreputable drugstore in town, in part because it is Willy himself who consumes all the drugs the store dispenses (see ""Christian's Drugstore"" in this index).  And when that hitman buys his cigarettes, it's at West's Drugstore.  In most of the texts no owner's name is mentioned.  We assume that all the stores linked to this entry are versions of the same 'Jefferson's drugstore,' but it's possible that Faulkner sometimes imagines his town having more than one drugstore on the Square.</p>

"074","Jefferson Movie Theater|Airdome","","","","","","","<p>When Mink Snopes comes to Jefferson in <em>The Mansion</em>, he is surprised to see something called an ""Airdome"" in what had been ""a vacant lot""; he can hear a piano playing behind the ""big high plank stockade"" around the lot, but doesn't pay the ten cents to join the other people who are going inside the fence to see a new diversion: a moving picture.  This is in 1908.  By the 1920s, movie theaters were a regular feature of the landscape in American towns, and in ""Dry September,"" set in that decade, the inside of the theater on the Square in Jefferson resembles ""a miniature fairyland with its lighted lobby and colored lithographs of life caught in its terrible and beautiful mutations"" (181). The town's theater on the Square in Jefferson appears in 10 texts, though ""Dry September"" is one of only three that take readers far enough inside to get any glimpse of the movie.  That story describes what Minnie sees over the heads of the ""paired"" couples in the theater as an accumulating ""silver dream,"" which is abruptly broken into when she begins laughing hysterically (181).  The same trope is used to describe what Mink could have seen on the screen (probably a large piece of white cloth) in the Airdome: ""the passionate and evanescent posturings where danced and flickered the ephemeral hopes and dreams"" (37). (See also <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, where Chick Mallison is sitting across from the theater when the movie ends; the ""blinking"" and ""fumbling"" audience coming out into the light of the Square is described ""bringing back into the shabby earth a fading remnant of the heart's celluloid and derring dream,"" 33). The third movie Faulkner describes, less abstractly, is the serial installment of a western that the Grier family witnesses in the early 1940s, with a villain who carries a ""pearl-handled pistol"" and a hero who rides a ""spotted horse"" (112).  Beginning in 1932 Faulkner himself, of course, went to Hollywood a number of times over two decades to work as a studio script writer, and it's interesting to consider the influence of film on his fiction.  But <em>in</em> his fiction the movies are treated mainly with a kind of disdain, as a debased alternative to the stories he is trying to tell.  At least, when the wife of the deputy sheriff in ""Pantaloon in Black"" stops listening to her husband's account of Rider's story, it's because ""I'm going to the picture show"" (255).</p>

Only one text locates events in the sheriff's office: <em>Light in August</em>, which locates the office on the Square (415).

"087","Road Traveled by the Lynchers","","","","","","","<p>In ""Dry September"" the lynchers drive ""out of town"" along a ""high road"" to get to the ""rutted lane"" that leads to the ice plant and then return to the high road again to drive still further from town before turning into the ""narrow road"" that leads to the brick kiln (176, 178, 179).  The story isn't explicit about where these roads are, or how far the cars travel, but does seem to suggest the high road leads toward the direction of the rising ""twice-waxed moon"" (175, 177) - i.e. east.  At any rate, that's what our plotting of the story assumes.  Hawkshaw is back on ""the highroad"" when, after the lynching, the emptier two cars pass him on their way back to Jefferson, close enough to town to see the glare of the town ""beneath the dust"" the cars stir up (179).  That dust helps us appreciate that in Yoknapatawpha a ""highroad"" is not to be confused with a 'highway' in our parlance; the county's highroads are basically the seven main ones that Faulkner drew on both his maps, and throughout the fictions they remain unpaved.</p>

It is presumably torn down when the property in turned into a housing development, which the ""Appendix"" refers to as ""row after row"" of small houses and which in the Jim Crow South would be restricted to whites; this may explain why Dilsey has moved to Memphis, though all the ""Appendix"" says about her leaving is that when she moved ""Dilsey refused to go further"" from Yoknapatawpha than Memphis (343).</p>

"096","St. Louis, Missouri","","","","","","","<p>St. Louis, Missouri, is almost 300 miles further from Yoknapatawpha than Memphis, which explains Frony phrase ""all de way fum Saint Looey"" in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (293).  It is also a much bigger city: its population was already over 100,000 when Calvin Burden moved his family there from New England in the 1850s (in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>), and over 800,000 in the 1930s, when Frony moves there herself to be with her unnamed husband (in ""Appendix Compson"").  Missouri did not secede from the union, but it was a slave-holding state, and the abolitionist Burden had to leave ""Saint Louis"" (as Faulkner occasionally spells it) after ""killing a man in an argument over slavery"" (242).  Granny (in <em>The Unvanquished</em>) saw a hot air balloon there before the Civil War.  She would have traveled there by riverboat, but the Eads Bridge connected the city to the eastern side of the river in 1874, and when the Mr. and Mrs. Compson went to the World Fair that was held there in 1904, they could have traveled by train.  That Fair is mentioned in both <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>The Hamlet</em>, and in the later novel Labove's basketball team from Frenchman's Bend goes there to win the Mississippi Valley tournament.

The photographs - like Snopes' pretentious name for the establishment - were brought to Yoknapatawpha from France.  The building is owned by Mrs. Compson, though the text never says if Jason or his mother know what the Atelier sells. The general population of Jefferson, especially the women, are led to believe it is ""a photographing studio"" (128), and Snopes does take some photographs that can be displayed in the windows.  But as the whole town eventually discovers, the ""dark room"" in the back is really where he uses a magic lantern to project ""pictures of men and women together, experimenting with one another"" (171): ""most of his business was at night like he did need darkness, his trade seeming to be mostly men now, . . . and the customers going and coming through the side door"" (131).

"101","Jefferson Water Tower","","","","","","","<p>Visually, the water tower or tank is the most significant feature of the town's skyline; as <em>The Town</em> notes, it can be seen ""standing against the sky above the Jefferson roof-line"" (30).  According to <em>The Mansion</em> it is the one part of Jefferson that is visible from two miles away (169). (See Hill Two Miles from Jefferson in this index.) It is first mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> in the context of the Sartoris story, when young Bayard uses it to swing on a rope over the freight cars and piles of lumber along the rail line into a swimming pool on the other side of the tracks in one of his early acts of reckless daring.  (This event is what decided us to locate the tower west of the Square, in the area of the tracks, though in Oxford the tower is on the other side of town.)  In the other three texts in which it is used as a location, however, Faulkner shifts the context from Sartorises to Snopeses.  Beginning in ""Centaur in Brass"" it is Flem Snopes' ""monument to himself"" (149).  As a monument it is very ironic: ""taller than anything in sight,"" but at the same time a symbol of the threat Flem's venality poses to the rest of the town, ""filled with a transient and symbolical liquid that was not even fit to drink"" (168).  The water tower is referred to again as Flem's monument in both <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>.  And in the larger story of Yoknapatawpha the Sartoris context is still there, because of the implicit juxtaposition of the 'achievement' evoked by Flem's ""monument - polluting the town's water supply - to the imposing statue of Colonel Sartoris that stands in the Jefferson cemetery in other fictions.</p>

In <em>The Town</em>, Ohio is where Matt Levitt is from, where he won the Golden Gloves and where he attended the ""new Ford mechanic's school"" (192).

"1012","Wallstreet Snopes's Grocery Store","","","","","","","<p>Near to the tent where Snopeses live when they first reach Jefferson is the store that serves as the launch point for Wallstreet Panic Snopes' success story - a story that provides an edifying counterpoint to Flem's rise to power and that also reveals the way 20th-century progress comes to Yoknapatawpha. When Wall begins working at this store as a janitor and ""afterschool-and-Saturday clerk and errand boy,"" it is a ""grocery store about the same class as the Snopes cafe"" (135) - which is to say, a low class. With the money from his father's death, he buys into the store, and becomes the owner when ""the old owner died"" (152).   Wall first rents and then buys ""the store next door and converted it into a warehouse, stock room, so he could buy in larger wholesale lots for less money; another few years and he had rented what had been the last livery stable in Jefferson for his warehouse and knocked down the wall between the two stores and now we had in Jefferson the first self-service grocery store we had ever seen, built on the pattern which the big chain grocery stores were to make nation-wide in the purveying of food"" (157). (This self-service ""pattern"" - pioneered by a Piggly-Wiggly store in Memphis in 1923 - is by now very old and familiar: instead of asking a clerk behind a counter for what they want, customers were given direct access to the aisles and shelves.) Wall also adapts retail to the automobile age: ""the street his store faced on made an L with the alley where the old Snopes restaurant had been so that the tent in which he had passed his first night in Jefferson was directly behind his store too; he either bought or rented that lot . . . and made a parking lot and so taught the housewives of Jefferson to come to town and seek his bargains and carry them home themselves"" (157).

"1014","Jefferson Cotton Gin","","","","","","","<p>Cotton gins play a crucial role in the economy of Yoknapatawpha.

Since a gin is only used once each year, when the cotton is picked, it is typically housed in a simple structure. Though Faulkner never describes the operation of one in any detail, his fictions mention several different gins around the county. This ""cotton gin"" on the outskirts of Jefferson appears the same way in ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" and <em>The Unvanquished</em>: as the place where the freedmen are gathered, ""under guard,"" ahead of the election (204).  <em>The Town</em> mentions that this same ""gin and compress""  - or perhaps another - is located near the Blue Goose Cafe, a Negro juke joint (167).</p>

But two late fictions - ""Knight's Gambit"" and <em>The Town</em> - also refer to an Episcopalian church <em>in</em> Jefferson.  In the story Charles Mallison sees ""above the trees"" of the town the ""gold cross on the spire of the Episcopal church"" from the window of the train on which he's riding as a sign of ""home""  (253).  According to the novel, the small Episcopal church is ""the oldest extant building in town""; it was ""built by slaves"" (321).

""Country people"" in the Yoknapatawpha fictions are invariably white, but the majority of the places that Faulkner calls 'cabins' are lived in by Negroes - especially when the cabins are inside the town, as this one is.  So inside the word ""rejuvenated"" may lurk a significant sociological story about how the former slave cabins in Jefferson (some of which, like Dilsey's in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> or Paralee's in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, are still occupied by the black domestic servants of the town's old aristocracy) have been fixed up to rent to whites.  But that is an interpretive speculation, as is our decision about where to plot <em>this</em> cabin on the map.  <em>Flags</em> says only that it is ""on the edge of town"" (72); our choice to put it on the southeast side of Jefferson is almost entirely speculative. The cabin is far enough from the railroad station that they use a borrowed car to get there from the cabin, which suggested the east side of town. And the fact that so many other ""country people"" in <em>Flags</em> are from Frenchman's Bend suggested the southeast side.</p>

"1026","First Hunting Stand in Big Woods","","","","","","","<p>A deer-hunting 'stand' can be a structure, a platform attached to a tree that allows the hunter to wait a dozen or so feet above the ground for his prey to walk past - or the term 'stand' can simply mean a specific place on the ground, usually against a tree, where the hunter waits.  In the Yoknapatawpha fictions it usually is the second kind of 'stand' that is meant.  In either case, it's a safety precaution: when a group of hunters go into the woods at the same time, as is also the usual case in Faulkner's fictions, each man stays at his 'stand' and knows where the other hunters are.  In ""A Bear Hunt"" the ""deer standers"" are spaced out into at least three places along the railroad track that runs through the woods; this first stand is occupied by Ike McCaslin (69). The fact that Ike ""turns"" to Provine, who is sitting ""down on a log behind"" him, suggests that the stands in this story are simply assigned spots ""along the log-line levee"" (69).</p>

Even in the wilderness, in other words, the living arrangements follow the pattern of the plantations and town residences where Yoknapatawpha's upper-class white families live.  Kitchens were set apart from the main residence for several reasons - to keep the heat and smell of cooking away from the rest of the house, for example, and to provide a kind of protection against fire - but at the same time the fact that the kitchen was a separate or semi-detached space made it a racially defined space, the place in this story as in so many of the other fictions where black characters can be found when they are not serving their white masters or employers.  This is probably true of the arrangements at De Spain's hunting camp in all of the dozen texts in which it figures, but ""A Bear Hunt"" is the only text to make this explicit.

Many real earthen mounds, built at different times over almost two thousand years by the aboriginal peoples who once occupied Mississippi, still exist.  The frame narrator calls the mound in this story, where he and a friend once spent a sleepless night as boys having an adventure, ""profoundly and darkly enigmatic"" (65), and indeed there are still unanswered questions about the origins and purposes of many of the mounds.  Ultimately in this tale the ""dark power"" of this particular mound is used comically, as a great way to cure hiccups - or take revenge (65).

Bennington in Vermont was an all-female college until after the novel was published.  The other schools, however, don't seem to fit Gavin's ""finishing-school"" designation.

"1085","European Theater in World War II","","","","","","","<p>The Second World War plays a smaller role in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha fictions than the First, but three texts refer to various wartime events in Europe.  <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> mentions three European locations that were the sites of significant moments in the history of the war. ""Warsaw and Dunquerque"" appear together in the account of how black farmers and field hands in Yoknapatawpha left the region or became otherwise unavailable for working on the big plantations (193).  Although the U.S. didn't enter the war until the end of 1941, the government began drafting young men in 1940 in response to what happened in these two places - among others around the world.  Warsaw is the capital of Poland, which was invaded by the German army on 1 September 1939. ""Dunquerque"" (usually anglicized as Dunkirk) was the coastal city in northern France from which England had to evacuate 47,000 troops after German forces overran the country in May 1940 (193).  ""Utah Beach,"" also mentioned in <em>Requiem</em>, was the code name that the Allies gave to the westernmost of the five Normandy beaches where in June 1944 the D-Day invasion of occupied Europe put 156,000 troops back in France (193).  The main events of ""Knight's Gambit"" take place between December 4 and December 6, 1941, right on the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor that launched the U.S. into the War.  Both explicitly and implicitly, the war in Europe forms a significant background to the story's events.  'The Battle of Britain,' the World War II aerial campaign during four months in 1940 during which the British ""Royal Air Force's fighter command"" triumphed over Germany's bombers (205), whet 17-year-old Charles Mallison's ""thirst"" to ""get to England some way"" to share in the glory that he associates with combat (206-07).  And sometime after the U.S. declaration of war, England is where Benbow Sartoris has been sent on ""something hush hush"" for the war effort (251).  Two other Mississippians serve in the war's European theater.  In ""By the People"" and again in <em>The Mansion</em>, Colonel Devries, from a county next to Yoknapatawpha, serves with distinction as the commander of a unit of Negro troops, earning a Congressional Medal of Honor.  The one Yoknapatawphan in who serves in Europe, though with less distinction, is Charles Mallison, who in <em>The Mansion</em> flies over Nazi occupied territory as a bombardier until his plane crash lands and he spends the remainder of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp in Limbourg, Belgium, where the biggest threat turns out to be the weekly bombing raids by the Royal Air Force on a German ""marshalling yard"" next to the stalag (324).</p>

The other nations involved in that conflict were Germany, Italy and Soviet Russia: the Fascist governments of the first two supported General Francisco Franco's Nationalist forces - using the occasion to try out many of the tactics and weapons they would soon deploy in the Second World War; the Communists supported the Republicans, which the F.B.I. agent who shows up in Jefferson to investigate Linda calls ""the Loyalist Communist army"" (260).  Linda and Barton are among the many foreign volunteers - including many writers like Andre Malraux - who fight for the Republic.

"1089","Eula Acres","","","","","","","<p>The Compson place on the edge of Jefferson was originally one of the largest and oldest antebellum slave plantations in Yoknapatawpha, built on a square mile of land ""granted to Quentin Compson in 1821"" by ""Mahataha, the Chickasaw matriarch"" (367); it is also a major site in Faulkner's imagination. <em>The Town</em> reminds readers of this earlier history before going on to add a couple ironic new chapters.  The Compsons had to sell ""a good part of [their land] off back in 1909 for the municipal golf course in order to send the eldest son, Quentin [the great-grandson of the Quentin who acquired the land], to Harvard"" (354) - an event that constitutes a major loss for Quentin's brother Benjy in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (1929).  In 1929, ""the golf links"" move still further out of town, and the third Compson brother, Jason, buys the property back (355).  During World War II, there is speculation that the government plans to locate ""an air-training field"" on the property (356), and in 1943 Flem Snopes bought it from Jason.  The airfield is never built, but soon after the War ends, Flem chops the Compson's ""ancestral acres"" (363) up ""into a subdivision of standardised Veterans' Housing matchboxes"" that he names ""Eula Acres,"" an ambiguous tribute to his dead wife (366).  Within a few months the property is ""dotted over with small brightly painted pristinely new hutches as identical (and about as permanent) as squares of gingerbread or teacakes"" (366).

The text that spends the most time in the city is <em>The Mansion</em>, which mentions a number of specific landmarks, like the Twenty-One and Stork Clubs and Central Park.

Its financial district provides food for Jason Compson's hopes and fuel for his anger in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>.  The sweatshops that make clothes and the factories that make munitions come up in ""Appendix Compson"" and <em>Sanctuary</em>.

Included in this category are the descendants of the enslaved people on the Old Frenchman's plantation, who in both ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard"" and <em>The Hamlet</em> are referred to as ""the progenitors of saxophone players in Harlem honky-tonks"" (136).

Meadowfill's property is located on a strip of land described by the deed as ""south to the road known as Freedom Springs Road then east along said Road"" (367). On this site he builds a ""little unwired un-plumbing-ed house"" (361).

Faulkner admires both McKinley and Essie, and obviously exempts this residence from his contempt for the whole idea of a housing development, but it's not clear why he makes this one exception.    Smith's plans for the house include ""millwork and trim which only the expert carpenter could do"" (375) - perhaps he is persuaded by the individualism expressed in these details.

"1095","Small Farms in Yoknapatawpha","","","","","","","<p>In addition to the many small farms identified with specific farmers (like the Bundrens or the Griers among others in Frenchman's Bend), in three later fictions Faulkner refers more generally to Yoknapatawpha's smaller farms, such as the ""forty- and fifty- and sixty-acre hill farms inaccessible from unmarked dirt roads"" mentioned in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> (193) and the ""remote back-country dog-trot cabins"" that Ratliff visits on his salesman's trips around the county in ""By the People"" (86).  The adjectives here - ""inaccessible,"" ""remote"", even ""hill"" - indicate that these farms are built on poor soil, compared to adjectives like 'rich' and 'bottom land' that are used in the fictions to describe the ground on which the big plantations have been built.  The living that can be sweated out of these smaller pieces of land is an impoverished one, and according to <em>The Mansion</em> the families on these farms have always struggled for subsistence; at least, when that novel mentions how the three successive presidents of the Merchants' and Farmers' bank over the decades between the 1890s and the 1940s have all ridden around the county on horse-drawn carriages or in chauffeured cars to view ""the cotton farms they represented the mortgages on"" (174), it was a constant that many of them were ""in process of foreclosure"" (243). But at the same time, changes over the course of the 20th century - from the Depression of the 1930s to the way tractors make the cultivation of 40-acre farms still less economically feasible - lead to the disappearance of tenants and small farmers as well as mules.  Given the preoccupations of Faulkner's art with loss, the historical fact that so many small farms are disappearing may account for the imaginative fact that his later fictions appear to be more interested in them.</p>

This is in the late 1940s, but no other details are given - neither the size nor location of the mill, for example - so we can't be sure what this mill tells us about progress in northern Mississippi.  But assuming it is on an electric grid rather than battery operated, and in or near the hill country where Yoknapatawpha's corn is typically grown (much of it for making moonshine whiskey), this could be Faulkner's indirect way of acknowledging the success of the New Deal's Tennessee Valley Authority in bringing electricity to the rural south.  The town of Jefferson, of course, has a power plant that provides electricity to the townspeople by the beginning of the 20th century, but the mills in most of the previous fictions are powered by water or steam.</p>

"1099","The Seminary","","","","","","","<p>In the last two volumes of the Snopes trilogy Faulkner creates an institution of higher learning in Yoknapatawpha.  Both <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em> mention ""the Seminary,"" which in the earlier novel Charles Mallison calls ""a college"" (367).  There is the usual inconsistency in what Faulkner says about this school.  In <em>The Town</em> Melisandre Backus and Maggie Mallison both go there after high school (52), while in <em>The Mansion</em> they go to the Academy (217) and it's Linda Snopes who enrolls in the Seminary after high school (156).  Based on the consistent fact that the characters who go there are all female, and go there after high school, it seems likely that Faulkner imagines the Seminary as a kind of finishing school for upper class, or at least well-to-do young women.  In Lafayette County, the original of Yoknapatawpha, there still is a real place named 'College Hill,' which is located where Faulkner locates his ""Seminary Ridge.""  'College Hill' is named for the Presbyterian academy that opened there in 1840; Faulkner himself was married in the Presbyterian church on College Hill.</p>

"110","Jefferson Railroad Line","","","","","","","<p>The railroad line that runs from north to south straight down the middle of Yoknapatawpha on both the maps that Faulkner made was built in the decade after the Civil War by Colonel John Sartoris.  The story of how he built it is told, briefly and with a few variations, in three Yoknapatawpha novels, starting with the first, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  Will Falls reminds the Colonel's son how Sartoris rode ""up and down the survey with a saddlebag of money night and day, keepin' jest one cross tie ahead of the po'house"" (22).  Included in the chest of Sartoris relics that that son opens is a ""long-necked oil can such as locomotive drivers use,"" made of silver and engraved with the date the first train, pulled by a locomotive that John named ""Virginia,"" arrived in the depot in Jefferson: ""August 9, 1873"" (88-89).  On the whole the fictions treat the railroad as one of the Colonel's great legacies to the county: the statue that the family erects over his grave faces out over the tracks.  But there is blood on those tracks. In <em>Flags</em> Sartoris originally had a partner in his railroad venture, a man named Redlaw, whom the Colonel buys out before the line is finished; when Redlaw kills him later, the residual animosity created by the venture is one of the causes.  And in <em>The Unvanquished</em> the Colonel's son Bayard describes the building of the railway too; his account includes how his father killed a ""hill man"" whom he suspected without evidence was going to rob him as he rode along ""the unfinished line with two saddlebags of gold coins borrowed on Friday to pay the men on Saturday"" (220).  <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> gives the Colonel a third partner in the venture: General Compson.  He too was bought out, but it's a bit surprising that Faulkner decided to associate a Compson with such a purely commercial enterprise.  Even more surprising is the way the narrator of that text calls it ""a railroad from Jefferson north into Tennessee"" (187); most of the events associated with Yoknapatawpha's railroad do take place north of Jefferson, but it also runs south from town. Throughout the fictions trains serve as the major way in which Yoknapatawpha is connected to the larger world, bringing characters up from Mottstown, for example, as well as taking them north toward Memphis and beyond.  Faulkner also notes in <em>The Mansion</em> that the last passenger train stops in Jefferson in 1935 (446). That day in 1873 when the first train arrived is described by Bayard as a huge moment for the people of Jefferson: Colonel Sartoris himself was driving, blowing ""blast after blast on the whistle,"" and at the station was ""a Confederate flag and girls in white dresses and red sashes and a band"" (<em>Unvanquished</em>, 226).  Scenes <em>on</em> the trains that run on the Colonel's railroad have their own Location, but the tracks themselves serve as an important location in several of the texts.  It's significant that when the Colonel's great-grandson Bayard, for example, returns to Jefferson after World War I in <em>Flags</em>, rather than getting off the train at the station - or as it's called by Simon, a family servant who was there when the track was laid, ""de dee-po his own folks built"" (7) - he jumps off the train on the wrong side of the tracks: that's one way the novel measures the distance between the great past and modernity, especially when in a later text like <em>The Unvanquished</em> Faulkner can describe the grandeur of the way the first Sartoris drives that first train into the station.  In <em>Light in August</em> the railroad tracks carry Gail Hightower and his wife into Jefferson, and Lucas Burch away from Lena Grove and her newborn child.  If Burch uses the tracks to sneak out of town, in <em>The Mansion</em> Mink Snopes uses them to sneak into Jefferson, evading detection as he returns after forty years to kill Flem by walking along the tracks for miles.  It's also on the tracks, at a ""sharp curve . . . below town,"" that Mrs. Hait's husband is killed while taking part in another Snopes' sordid scheme: both ""Mule in the Yard"" and <em>The Town</em> (243) describe the way I.O. Snopes uses the railroad as a source of income by arranging to have the mules he can't sell run down by the train.  The great-grandfather of William Faulkner, a man named Colonel William Falkner, also built a railroad line after the Civil War; it runs through Ripley, Mississippi, but as Wikipedia puts it, ""the first station on the line north of Ripley was located in what is now the community of Falkner.""  It's not surprising the his great-grandson puts a railroad at the center of his maps, and so many of his fictions.</p>

"1101","Jefferson Negro School","","","","","","","<p>In Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha, education, like most aspects of social life, was rigidly segregated - although that racial reality is seldom explicitly acknowledged or described.  When Isom talks about what he ""learnt in school"" in ""There Was a Queen"" (732), there is no further description of the school he went to.  In ""Pantaloon in Black"" Rider's lynched body is found hanging in a ""negro schoolhouse"" in the county (252, 147), and curiously, in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> it is again the idea of a lynching that occasions one of the rare moments in the fictions that make the fact of segregated education explicit: when Gavin Stevens mentions how the threat of a lynch mob has closed the schools in Jefferson, he refers directly to both the ""Negro school"" in Jefferson that Aleck Sanders attends and the ""white school"" that Chick Mallison goes to (126).  Chick's school is mentioned two other times in that novel, as ""the High School"" (26) and ""the high school"" (121), which reminds us that ordinarily there's no need to add the word 'white' - that's the default assumption of the fiction.  The only the only time a fiction takes us inside Jefferson's Negro school is in <em>The Mansion</em>, when the white Linda Snopes Kohl returns from her experiences in Greenwich Village and the Spanish Civil War to challenge the Yoknapatawpha's Jim Crow system by going ""without invitation or warning, into the Negro grammar and high school"" to talk to the students about a plan to improve their education (246).  The episode is described at some length.  At least, how unhappy her actions make everyone else, including the school's Negro principal, is described, but not the school itself.  There is one other mention of this school later in the novel: when the narrative reaches the mid-1940s, the narrator states that ""the Negroes now had a newer and better high school building in Jefferson than the white folks had"" (385), one reason why the quixotic Linda has ""nothing to tilt against now in Jefferson"" (385) - this again according to the narrator, although the idea that there's no reason to be concerned about Negro education is a fairly amazing assertion to make in a novel published in 1959, after the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in <em>Brown v Board of Education</em> and at the very time the Jim Crow system throughout the South, including the segregated school system, was under attack from the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

According to that first fiction, it is not segregated by gender: Charles' mother went to ""the female half of the Academy"" (152).  According to that second fiction, however, after World War II, probably in response to the G.I.

But we first hear about Yoknapatawpha's ""country club"" in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, when Temple sums up, with some bitterness, the life she and Gowan led after their marriage: one of the fashionable elements in it was ""a country club with a country club younger set of rallying friends"" with whom to drink on Saturday nights (124).   This would have been in the early 1930s.  According to <em>The Mansion</em>, the country club was already there in 1929, because that's the date the novel provides for when the golf course that was originally built in the early 20th century on land that the Compsons sold (in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>) ""moved out to the country club"" (355).  According to ""Appendix Compson,"" however, the relocation of the ""golfcourse"" didn't occur until sometime after 1933 (331).  These are the kinds of inconsistencies that make trying to locate Faulkner's locations in either space or time so adventurous.

During a visit in the summer of 1860, she wanders down the ""raked and sanded paths"" of the formal garden, imagining Bon and Judith's courtship, an image that caused ""a child's vacant fairy-tale to come alive in that garden"" (117-18).  In their reconstruction of the story, Quentin and Shreve also imaginatively inhabit this garden, seeing ""the sister and the lover in the garden"" vicariously through Henry Sutpen's eyes as they ""paced slowly"" among the ""jasmine, spiraea, honeysuckle, perhaps myriad scentless unpickable Cherokee roses"" - a description that dissolves when they remember that ""the time had been winter in that garden . . . and hence no bloom nor leaf"" (236).  When Rosa moves out to the plantation after Bon's death, she works with Judith and Clytemnestra in the kitchen gardens, ""growing and tended and harvesting with our own hands the food we ate"" (125).

The other two graves belong to Charles Bon and his son, who are Sutpens too, though Judith may not have known that when she ordered their headstones.  (The remains of Sutpen's other two children, Clytemnestra and Henry, never make it to the graveyard; they are effectively cremated when Sutpen's mansion burns down, and their ashes mingled with the ashes of the house.)  In Chapter 6, Quentin Compson and his father take refuge from the rain under the cedars, and while they sit beside the graves Mr. Compson disinters parts of the Sutpen story for his son, who thinks several times that ""I have heard too much"" (168).

However, the other occupation that most of the men in the General's caste practice is lawyer, so that seems the likely explanation here; it would explain why the office is near the courthouse (163), and why Judith seeks his help in the courtroom.  In the earlier text <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the General's son, Jason Compson, is a lawyer, although his avocation in that novel is drinking at home, and his office is not mentioned.  And in the ""Appendix"" that Faulkner wrote for <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> a decade after <em>Absalom!</em> was published, Jason keeps but no longer uses ""an office upstairs above the Square"" in Jefferson; it's an old office, where the ""dusty filing-cases . . . entomb"" many of ""the oldest names in the county"" (330), so it seems likely Faulkner imagines it as the same one his father had.</p>

"1118","Jefferson Negro Store District","","","","","","","<p>In the Yoknapatawpha fictions as a group, Jefferson's black population lives in two different places.  The domestic servants who are employed by the town's older families typically live behind their employers' houses (as was the case with Faulkner's own ""mammy,"" Caroline Barr).  Most of the rest of the black population lives in an area west of the Square.  This area wears several different names in the Yoknapatawpha fictions: Freedman Town, Negro Hollow, Nigger Hollow.  Three texts suggest the possibility that within this part of town there are businesses that are owned by Negroes.  In Faulkner's first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Byron Snopes goes in search of a man who can sell him a getaway car in ""a street occupied by negro stores and barber shops"" (272). In <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> Charles Etienne Saint-Valery Bon usually gets ""blind or violently drunk in the negro store district on Depot Street"" (170).  That street name suggests a place near the railroad, which is where Negro Hollow is located in the other fictions.  In both these texts, the ambiguous phrase ""negro stores"" might mean the stores are simply patronized by Negroes, or could mean that they are owned by them as well.  There is one such store in ""Uncle Willy"": Sonny Barger's, which has its own Location.  Barger's store is in a part of town called ""Nigger Row"" (234), using a term that is rightly offensive now but would have been common in Faulkner's South, and that may indicate the presence of a number of black-owned businesses.

"1119","Mississippi River","","","","","","","<p>The Mississippi River figures in a number of Yoknapatawpha fictions, as one would expect, since before the railroads and the automobile the River was a major thoroughfare for people going to or leaving places like Yoknapatawpha, and the main way cotton was shipped from Mississippi plantations to northern factories.   As the ""Appendix Compson"" notes, ""the whole Mississippi Valley"" (327) is the immense area drained by the Mississippi River and its tributaries.  The ""Appendix"" is one of the places in the fictions that pay particular attention to the River as a Location in our sense of the term.  Two other texts make still more significant use of it.  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> Faulkner's focus is wide-angled.  The Mississippi River and the towns that grew up along its banks - ""St Louis, Paducah, Memphis, Helena, Vicksburg, Natchez, Baton Rouge"" (82) - appear in the novel as a major element in the historical story that Yoknapatawpha is part of.  The antebellum era as a ""new age"" for the nation flows through the ""vast single net of commerce webbed and veined [by the waters of] the mid-continent's fluvial embracement"" (83).  The novel locates Jefferson in this context, putting it ""about midway between"" the River and the Natchez Trace, the other, early, overland transportation route to Yoknapatawpha (6).  <em>Absalom!</em> uses the larger River thematically: as ""that Continental Troth, that River which runs . . . through the physical land,"" it is the symbolic ""geologic umbilical"" that connects Quentin Compson as a southerner with Shreve McCannon as a Canadian (208).  At a much more personal level, the deck of a steamboat moving on the moving river - ""suspended immobile and without progress from the stars themselves"" (250) - provides a very resonant site for Charles Bon's musings on his identity.  It is also at the center of the wanderings of Bon's son Charles Etienne Saint-Valery Bon, who inherits his father's anguish about identity, for ""something like a year"" (167);  among the men he provokes, racially, into beating him are ""negro stevedores and deckhands on steamboats"" (167).</p>

The narrative's depiction of Sutpen's birthplace relies on a set of simplifications that sharply distinguish it as a rugged frontier from the older, more socially stratified slave-holding regions of the South.  In the mountains, ""the only colored people are Indians,"" ""the land belongs to anybody and everybody,"" nobody owns more ""objects"" than anybody else (179) - and everyone lives in democratically similar cabins that ""didn't have back doors"" that a ragged boy could be told he had to use (188).</p>

It is imagined as the antithesis of the egalitarian and still largely natural world where Sutpen was born in the mountains of western Viginia: Tidewater Virginia is ""a country all divided and fixed and neat with a people living on it all divided and fixed and neat because of what color their skins happened to be and what they happened to own"" (179). The most significant places in this place are the cabin where he and his family live, with its ""rough partly rotten log walls"" and ""sagging roof"" (190); the big house ""two miles away,"" home of the planter for whom his father works, ""the biggest house he had ever seen"" (184); the quarters where this man's slaves live, with ""their sound roofs and white wash,"" and the nearby commissary (185); the school which he attends ""for about three months one winter"" (194); and the hiding place to which he retreats after being ordered away from the front door of the big house - ""a place where a game trail entered a cane brake and an oak tree had fallen across it and made a kind of cave"" (188).  If 'westward' in America's national mythology is associated with the quest for freedom, especially freedom from the evils of the Old World, then it is very significant that Sutpen ""falls"" into this world by traveling east (180).</p>

"1126","Haiti","","","","","","","<p>Although Quentin most often refers to it generically as the ""West Indies"" (192) and Shreve flippantly refers to it as ""Porto Rico or Haiti or wherever it was"" (239), the place to which Sutpen goes to accomplish the first step in his design is the island of Haiti, as the Chronology and the Genealogy at the end of <em>Absalom!</em> make clear.  The ""Haiti"" in the novel is not the historical Haiti, which successfully won independence from France and abolished slavery in1804, before Sutpen was born; Faulkner's Haiti is still a slave-holding French colony when Sutpen arrives there in 1820, and the slave rebellion depicted in the novel occurs in the late 1820s.  <em>Absalom!</em> represents ""Haiti"" in vague and essentially symbolic terms that evoke both the American dream and Joseph Conrad's descriptions of the Congo in <em>Heart of Darkness</em>.  The 14-year-old Sutpen who goes there imagines it as a land of opportunity, ""a place called the West Indies to which poor men went in ships and became rich"" (195).  The one long description of the ""little lost island,"" furnished in Quentin's narrative but based on what his ""Grandfather said,"" locates it in a moral realm rather than in the Caribbean or in history: as ""the halfway point between what we call the jungle and what we call civilization,"" as ""a spot of earth which might have been created and set aside by Heaven itself, Grandfather said, as a theatre for violence and injustice and bloodshed and all the satanic lusts of human greed and cruelty"" (202).  In terms of the story, the most important Haitian setting is the French sugar plantation where Sutpen is an overseer until the slaves revolt, and afterward where he marries his first wife and has his first child, and where he acquires the twenty slaves he brings with him to Yoknapatawpha.  In terms of Faulkner's engagement with the issue of slavery, it seems likely that just as he uses the Indians as slave-owners in the story ""Red Leaves,"" so here he uses a foreign country's exploitation of an enslaved population for profit as a way of engaging the history of slavery in the American South at an imaginatively safe distance: 'they' committed this injustice, not 'us.'  The planters of Haiti probably bought and sold people and sugar in livres or francs, but the novel's reference to Haiti as the place where ""the sheen on the dollars was not from gold but from blood"" (201-02) is what Freud called a parapraxis and we call a Freudian slip.</p>

By having him end up in this undignified grave, being actually eaten by the fish he set out to catch, ""in almost the exact center of the thousand and more acres his ancestor had once owned"" (71), Faulkner may have intended to suggest the fate of the aspirations of the Old South - much as in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> two children of Colonel Sutpen, whose slave plantation and mansion are even larger than Grenier's, are burned to death inside the fire that destroys his big house.  Lonnie's murder is avenged by his only companion, who then 'buries' the man who killed Lonnie for money at the end of another fishhook on the same line.</p>

"1131","Cumberland Gap|Cumberland Mountains","","","","","","","<p>The ""Cumberland Gap"" plays a major role in the history of the U.S. - and in several of Faulkner's later texts, a significant one in the history of Yoknapatawpha.  Historically, the Gap is a narrow pass through the Cumberland Mountains near the intersection of the states of Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee.  After the pass was discovered in the mid-18th century and Daniel Boone blazed the 'Wilderness Trail' through it, it became the portal through which the settlers who first inhabited the frontier southwest passed through the Appalachians.  In Faulkner's fictions the first mention of the Gap seems ominous: in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, it provides Thomas Sutpen with the way to bring the heavy marble tombstones he imported for his wife and himself from the eastern theater of the Civil War to Sutpen's Hundred in Yoknapatawpha.  The next three texts to mention it - ""Hand upon the Waters,"" ""A Name for the City"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> - all note that the first white men to settle Jefferson make their way to Mississippi through the Gap.  In the first of those texts the three are named Holston, Grenier and Stevens, and they all come from ""the Carolinas"" (70).  In the next two texts the men who ride ""across Tennessee from the Cumberland Gap"" are named Holston, Grenier and Habersham (<em>Requiem</em>, 7).  Faulkner's last novel, <em>The Reivers</em>, mentions the Cumberland Mountains along with the Ozarks as summer resort destinations (189), omitting the historical dimension.</p>

In Jefferson this judicial event would have been held in the courthouse at the center of town, but in rural parts of Yoknapatawpha other kinds of public spaces are routinely used for trials and inquests, such as the two country stores in ""Barn Burning"" and the Whiteleaf store and church in <em>The Hamlet</em>.</p>

"1136","Beyond|Heaven","","","","","","","<p>By placing the icon for ""Heaven"" above the ""World"" on the world maps for ""Beyond"" and <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, we are not trying to make a theological statement.  When Brother Fortinbride preaches Granny's eulogy in ""Vendee"" and confidently predicts ""where she has gone,"" we can agree or not, depending on our beliefs.  But our project requires every 'Event' to have a 'Location' and every 'Location' to appear on a map, so when Faulkner sets a scene with Flem Snopes in hell (in <em>The Hamlet</em>) or with Sutpen and Wash in heaven (in <em>Absalom!</em>) or with Judge Allison in a place called ""Beyond"" in the story with that name, while we wince at the way the way the limits of our scheme can bump up the complexities of his imagination, we have our job to do.  ""Hell"" has its own Location.  This entry represents the other two places, treating them as similar enough to bring together.  <em>Absalom!</em> describes the place to which both Sutpen and the man who killed him ""maybe"" have both gone as ""serene, pleasant, unmarked by time or change of weather,"" and even with a new ""scuppernong"" arbor in which they can sit - and where, curiously, their war against the Yankees can continue (152).  Most of ""Beyond"" takes place in a landscape that the story carefully refuses to name, or to attach to any particular religion.  It's not even clear whether it is an actual place or just a product of the judge's imagination.  But ""Beyond"" has certain distinct features. It has a ""narrow entrance"" (795) through which arrivals crowd and at which some people seem to linger in wait for others to arrive. Inhabitants seem to be able to wander there at will, and it has features of a conventional earthly landscape: a bench, for example, ""inside a park"" (788) where a child plays in the dust with his toys (792) and a boy named Howard ""rides past every day on his pony"" (794). It contains people who have killed themselves, who carry weapons, who have money and tobacco, and who have servants, as well as middle-class and poorer folks.

This common southern design feature - a detached or semi-detached kitchen - helped keep the heat and odor of cooking out of the 'big house' and served as a low-tech form of fire prevention: if the kitchen caught fire it was less likely to burn the whole house down.  At the same time this arrangement provided the white family's black servants with a place indoors where they could meet - as when Bayard first enters this kitchen and finds ""two negro men and a half-grown boy"" sitting ""behind the stove,"" talking with Mandy, 336).  What is anomalous about the arrangement at the MacCallums is the fact that the white family eats in the kitchen too, rather than in a dining room in the main house; this is one way the novel distinguishes the yeoman MacCallums from aristocratic families like the Sartorises and Benbows.

"1155","Paris, France","","","","","","","<p>Faulkner traveled to Paris in 1925, just before he began writing his first Yoknapatawpha fictions.  He went as an aspiring artist, and getting a glimpse of James Joyce at the Shakespeare & Company bookstore in Paris was an item on his itinerary.  Among his characters who also spend time in Paris are Temple Drake in <em>Sanctuary</em>; in fact, the last page of that novel, describing her state of mind while seated in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, is a slightly revised version of a piece of prose Faulkner wrote while sitting in the same place himself during his trip.  When <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> revisits Temple's story, it says she ended up spending a ""year in Europe, Paris,"" at the end of which she and Gowan Stevens are married at the American Embassy there (121); they honeymoon at Cap Ferrat (Cape Ferrat).  Gavin Stevens has an affair with a Russian emigree in Paris just after World War I, and some years later meets Mrs. Harriss, whom he will eventually marry back in Jefferson, living in a ""select"" and ""discreet"" street within spitting distance ""of the Bois de Boulogne"" (255). Perhaps the most unlikely Yoknapatawphan to visit Paris is Issetibbeha, the Chickasaw chief who goes abroad on the money he makes by selling ""forty head [of slaves] to a Memphis trader"" (320).  When he returns to Yoknapatawpha, Issetibbeha brings back some of the cast-offs of European culture: a gilt bed, a pair of girandoles reputedly owned by the mistress of King Louis XV, and a pair of slippers with red heels that plays an important role in the politics of the tribe (320). According to the ""Appendix"" to <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, the last known address of Caddy Compson is in Paris, from which she ""vanishes"" during World War II, ""with the German occupation"" of the city in 1940 (332).

Originally created by Indians, the Trace was a 440-mile trail through the wilderness between Nashville, Tennessee, and Natchez, Mississippi. It linked three rivers - the Cumberland, the Tennessee and the Mississippi.  In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it served as a major overland route for traders and settlers.  Historically, it passed through northern Mississippi to the east of Oxford, the town on which Jefferson is based.  As described in both ""A Name for the City"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, in the early history of Jefferson the Trace links the settlement to civilization back east. The three hundred miles of wilderness through which the Trace runs is a lawless place; though the ""special horseman"" who carries the mail between the settlement and Nashville rides up and down it ""every two weeks"" with a kind of impunity (201, 8), the ""rapine-haunted Trace"" is a ""region where for no more than the boots on his feet, men would murder a traveler"" (202, 9).  In time, however, the ""trackless infested forest"" through which the Trace passes becomes the route of ""the pioneer"" who ""drags his gravid wife and most of the rest of his mother-in-law's family behind him"" on the march of civilization westward (81).</p>

"1169","The West","","","","","","","<p>When the young Thomas Sutpen decides to leave his family in eastern Virginia for a new land of opportunity, he doesn't 'go west' - he goes south to the West Indies.  This is probably Faulkner's ironic take on the familiar cultural trope that young men go west to find or make their fortunes, on ""The West"" as a place both on a map and in the national psyche.  For very obvious reasons, 21st century readers identify Yoknapatawpha with 'the South,' and Faulkner's world as essentially antithetical to the idea of leaving the past behind which has always been crucial to the frontier trope, but to the men named Grier and Sartoris, Holston and McCaslin who traveled west through the wilderness to settle the area in the early 19th century Mississippi was at the western edge of 'the Southwest.'  The Civil War meant that young men in places like Yoknapatawpha had to look further west. <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, for example, uses a capital 'W' to describe how, immediately after the surrender at Appomattox, Southerners departed for places like ""Texas, the West, New Mexico"" (204); given that most people would define Texas and New Mexico as part of ""the West"" too, it's not clear exactly how this phrase defines ""the West"" as a place, but clearly all three places are seen as ""new land"" and even a source of ""new hope"" (204). In ""Hand upon the Waters"" Tyler Ballenbaugh ""went out West,"" where he is rumored to have won a lot of money ""gambling at cards"" (75); in this story ""the West"" is associated with ""violence,"" ""gambling,"" and vast ""sums"" (75).

""Caledonia"" is the Latin name that the Romans gave northern Britain, and it became a synonym for Scotland. As several of the fictions note, many of the first white settlers in Mississippi were of Scotch descent, and so it's not surprising to find more than one 'Caledonia' place name.  Presumably in Yoknapatawpha ""Caledonia"" is a rural hamlet like Frenchman's Bend. In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> Caledonia Chapel is in the hills northeast of Jefferson, and in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and elsewhere the McCallums (or MacCallums) live in the northeast corner of Yoknapatawpha, so that is where we have chosen to locate the scene of the fight.</p>

If Jefferson is more or less on the map where Oxford, Mississippi, is located, then that town would probably be Ripley, Mississippi.  This town has a ""square,"" suggesting that like Jefferson and the real Ripley it is a county seat (368), and a railroad station, which in this case is explicitly segregated into a ""waiting room"" and a ""colored waiting room"" (369).  Ripley is where the Falkner family rose to its greatest prominence, thanks to the achievements of Colonel William Falkner, whom Faulkner always acknowledged as the original for the character of Colonel John Sartoris.  Among those achievements was building the railroad, which would give a special autobiographical poignancy to the way Bayard Sartoris rides into exile on those tracks.  It is, however, by no means certain that Faulkner was thinking of this town as Ripley - and since Bayard's own great-grandfather was a railroad-builder too, the fact that it's a train that carries him away from home is poignant enough already.</p>

"1194","Cemetery North of Frenchman's Bend","Context (text, as interpreted)","<p>Although not explicitly named, the setting for the events in ""Hand Upon the Waters"" is the area in and around Frenchman's Bend.  The bend in the road, the store, the river and the history of the family of Louis Grenier (the original 'Old Frenchman') all make this clear to readers of the Yoknapatawpha fictions.  But the cemetery in this story cannot be the Frenchman's Bend cemetery that appears in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  Both are adjacent to churches, but in the novel the churchyard is on the road to Jefferson and visible from the Bend; in the short story the cemetery is some distance up a road that leads into the hills north of the Bend, a road which vanishes around its curves so that Gavin Stevens can only see a short distance along it.  As befits their hill-country location, both the ""white-painted and steepleless"" church and its cemetery are rugged: the churchyard is described as ""an unfenced straggle of cheap marble headstones and other graves outlined only by rows of inverted glass jars and crockery and broken brick"" (75).  Those homemade memorials resemble the ""shards of pottery and broken bottles and old brick"" that mark the graves in the African American cemetery in ""Pantaloon in Black,"" where they are explicitly identified with black burial rituals (<em>Go Down, Moses</em>, 129), but the cemetery in ""Hand Upon the Waters"" is almost definitely not an exception to the rules of Jim Crow segregation: the one person we know is buried there is white, and Frenchman's Bend is notorious in Faulkner's fictions for its lack of black inhabitants.</p>

"1213","Africa","","","","","","","<p>Given how many of the inhabitants of Yoknapatawpha have African ancestors, it is perhaps surprising that Faulkner only mentions ""Africa"" in six of the fictions.    And only ""Red Leaves"" really acknowledges the connection between Africa and slavery in the U.S.  The enslaved protagonist of this story remembers a few parts of his life before he became Issetibbeha's ""servant"": he was born in ""Guinea"" (327), a term which includes much of the modern nation of Cameroon, and ""taken"" into slavery ""by a trader off Kamerun"" (327-28).  Historically, a high percentage of the people taken to America and sold into slavery originally came from this area in West Africa.  This makes the connection between Yoknapatawpha and Africa explicit, but it's both an acknowledgment and an evasion, since this slave belongs to an Indian chief rather than to any of the county's white planters.  The other references to ""Africa"" also keep it at a distance from the realities of slavery in America - or for that matter, modern life <em>in</em> Africa.  In <em>Light in August</em> a generic ""African village"" is used as a point of reference to define the absolute racial difference between ""white"" and ""African"": two white men ""might have been brothers in the sense that any two white men strayed suddenly into an African village might look like brothers to them who live there"" (214).  ""Africa"" appears in <em>Absalom!</em> as an adjective when the Canadian Shreve predicts that ""in a few thousand years"" everyone will ""have sprung from the loins of African kings"" (302).  This is in the novel's penultimate paragraph; earlier the novel implicitly points to Africa in two phrases: ""what we call jungle"" and the ""dark inscrutable continent""; both of these, however, occur in the context of Sutpen's experience in the French colony of Haiti, where the ""two hundred years of oppression and exploitation"" of uprooted Africans again do not involve the white U.S. (202).  Two of the three times ""Africa"" is mentioned in <em>The Hamlet</em> locate it in the context of European colonialism. When Ratliff visits Columbia, Tennessee, and discovers that it is an untouched market for selling his sewing machines, his joy is compared to the feelings of ""the first white hunter blundering into the idyllic solitude of a virgin African vale teeming with ivory"" (61).   A few pages later the narrative depicts Will Varner and Flem Snopes settling the accounts of Varner's tenants in Frenchman's Bend and looking like ""the white trader and his native parrot-taught headman in an African outpost"" (67).  The description of Flem as a ""native headman"" is the only hint of an actual 'African' presence in these passages.  A real 'white hunter' appears in <em>The Reivers</em>: Paul Rainey, who ""took his pack of bear hounds to Africa"" to pit them against lions (163).  Race plays a role in the fifth mention of Africa, but not the race one might expect.  It appears in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.  The Square in Jefferson gains a new monument in the aftermath of World War II, a ""tank gun: captured from a regiment of Germans in the African desert by a regiment of Japanese in American uniforms""; these U.S. troops are the sons of ""mothers and fathers"" who have been interned in ""a California detention camp for enemy aliens"" (194).  The internment of Japanese-Americans is a real historical event, of course, and it is historically true that during the war Japanese-American troops fighting in Europe accumulated an impressive combat record - although in fact no Japanese-American troops were involved in fighting in Africa.  In the novel's context, the tank gun next to the Confederate statue is a monument to the way the modern South now sees itself as part of ""One nation"" (194).  But at the same time, it seems worth noting what's missing: any memorial to the longer history of ""Africa"" in Yoknapatawpha.  (See also the entries in the index for ""Egypt"" and ""Ethiopia."")</p>

The place seems poor even by the standards of rural Yoknapatawpha: in ""Shingles"" the father admits, perhaps with some hyperbole, that ""I don't own anything there that even I would borrow"" (34).  ""Two Soldiers"" goes into an unusual amount of detail about the kind of work that has to be done on one of these small farms, although ""Pap"" (like Anse Bundren in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>) expects all the work to be done by his sons. The older son, Pete, is a good hand: he has the ten acres that Pap gave him ""busted out and bedded for the winter"" with vetch  by early December; ""Pap,"" his younger son notes, ""was still behind, just like he had been since me and Pete had knowed him"" (82). In another seasonal task, the males chop firewood ""at the wood tree"" (83).  The family owns a mule and at least one cow.  Leaving aside the middle story, where the father's incompetence and laziness is destructive, the stories suggest that it is in country places like these subsistence farms that America will always find the men who will keep it safe in times of crisis.  In this the younger Griers, at least, resemble the somewhat more prosperous MacCallums of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and the McCallums of ""The Tall Men,"" and as representations of lower class Southern whites provide a kind of counterpoint to the Snopeses.</p>

"1230","Warren's Farm","","","","","","","<p>Located a few miles from town, this farm is where in ""Knight's Gambit"" Charles Mallison visits Captain Warren, who is now a farmer but who ""had been a flight commander in the old Royal Flying Corps"" during World War I (206).  As a site Warren's farm provides an interesting example of how responsive the demographics of Yoknapatawpha were to the needs of Faulkner's imagination.  Warren appears in the earlier ""Death Drag,"" where there is no mention of either his farm <em>or</em> Yoknapatawpha; his hometown in that story could be almost anywhere in the South.  But a dozen years after Faulkner published ""Death Drag,"" Malcolm Cowley chose to include the story in <em>The Portable Faulkner</em> he was editing for Viking.  As part of that project, Cowley asked Faulkner to create another map like the one he'd drawn for <em>Absalom!</em>  The map Faulkner drew in response gives all the texts in the anthology a place of some kind on the map, including a previously unmentioned Yoknapatawpha  ""Airport"" as the location for ""Death's Drag.""  When he wrote ""Knight's Gambit"" a few year's later, he decided retroactively to strengthen the connection between the story and the county by going back to Warren as a character and providing him with this farm not far from Jefferson.

"1232","Russia","","","","","","","<p>For many writers of Faulkner's generation the Russian Revolution of 1917 was almost as decisive an event as World War I.  The totalitarian government that came to power afterward was seen by many as a blueprint for a better future and by others as threat to western civilization.  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Jason's mention of ""Russia"" puts him clearly, if ignorantly, in the latter camp: he tells the sheriff who will not help him pursue Miss Quentin that Yoknapatawpha ""is not Russia, where just because he wears a little metal badge, a man is immune to law"" (304).  Faulkner doesn't mention Russia or the Soviet Union again until two much later texts.  ""Knight's Gambit"" mentions Russia twice.  The affair that Gavin Stevens had in Paris after World War I was with a ""Russian"" who ""had escaped from Moscow"" after the Russian Revolution (247). Charles Mallison is thinking about World War II in 1941 when he declares that the British have ""stopped [Germany] on the west"" and so the only fighting still going on is in ""the plumbless depths of Russia,"" the war's eastern front (205).  Among the more exotic inhabitants of Jefferson are the characters in <em>The Mansion</em> whom Charles Mallison identifies as ""two Finns,"" although confusingly he says they escaped ""from Russia in 1917"" (236). Finland, of course, borders Russia. The Revolution produced a lot of refugees from Russia, but Charles does not explain how these ""Finns"" came to be among that group.  There are two different chronological contexts for these three references: they occur in scenes set before 1945, but appear in texts published in 1949 and 1960, at the height of the post-war Cold War between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.</p>

However, if we assume McEachern drives east to take Joe ""home"" (144), it's not impossible that the town is or is near 'Memphis Junction,' which is based on the real town of Holly Springs, Mississippi, which Faulkner mentions on his 1936 map of Yoknapatawpha, and which appears in several of the fictions, and if that is what Faulkner has in mind, it would mean that Joe actually grows up not far from Jefferson, where he dies  - but all this is very speculative.</p>

In Faulkner's earlier fictions, the town where travelers on the northbound train from Yoknapatawpha change for the westbound train to Memphis is usually called ""Memphis Junction,"" though in <em>Sanctuary</em> Faulkner calls it Holly Springs, the real Mississippi town where the northbound tracks from Oxford crossed the westbound tracks to Memphis.  Parsham, though, is explicitly located in ""Tennessee"" (215), and it seems more likely that if Faulkner based it on a real place, that place is Grand Junction, Tennessee, where the annual National Championship for bird dogs was held at the time of the story.  Lucius describes Parsham as a ""community composed of one winter-resort hotel and two stores and a cattle shute and a depot at a railroad intersection and the churches and schools and scattered farmhouses of a remote countryside"" (189).</p>

While most of the servicemen in the story are aviators, the Subadar served with infantry troops; he describes both the allied ""trench"" in which the troops ""squat, motionless"" for days (424), and the German ""trench"" which the same troops charge and capture for several days (425).

"1255","Tennessee in the Civil War","","","","","","","<p>More than half of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha fictions include scenes in or references to Tennessee - particularly Memphis.  A much smaller number mention or include scenes set in Tennessee during the Civil War.  In <em>The Unvanquished</em> the irregular troop led by Colonel John Sartoris is described both hiding from and capturing Yankee soldiers, though these fictional events are non-violent.  Historically, on the other hand, Tennessee saw some of the bloodiest fighting of the war, including the campaign for Chattanooga which is referred to in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, and especially the battle called 'Shiloh' in the North and 'Pittsburg Landing' in the South; Faulkner calls it Shiloh in ""Raid,"" ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" and <em>The Unvanquished</em>, but Pittsburgh Landing in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>  The battle was fought on April 6-7, 1862, just twenty miles north of Corinth, Mississippi, and so within about a hundred miles of the imaginary location of Jefferson; the casualties over the two days of fighting totaled 23,746.  One of the fictional Confederate dead was Gavin Breckbridge, Drusilla Hawk's fiance.  And a fictional Confederate regiment there was commanded by General Quentin Compson.  According to the ""Appendix"" to <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> that Faulkner wrote in the 1940s, General Compson ""failed"" at the battle, though the text does not say how (329).  According to <em>Absalom!</em> he lost an arm there, and in one of the novel's many unresolved narrative questions, either Henry Sutpen helped save the wounded Charles Bon (217), or Bon rescued the wounded Henry (275).

There are hills both east and west of Jefferson but this is the only reference to these ""caves"" in the fictions, so we have had to guess where in the county Faulkner imagines them.

Presumably the somewhat scriptural structure of the sentence - ""from time to time he passed"" - is meant to call attention to the fact that, on this Easter Sunday, the people who have gone inside these churches are seeking eternity, and perhaps finding it for themselves, while Jason is looking for his salvation in the money he's chasing - and won't find.</p>

"1258","Carolina in the Civil War","","","","","","","<p>The first shots of the Civil War were fired when Confederates attacked the Federal army's Fort Sumter in the harbor at Charleston, South Carolina.  Faulkner refers to this event in 5 different fictions, and in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> even notes the first military action that preceded the attack on Sumter: the fall of Fort Moultrie (11), which was evacuated by its Federal garrison and occupied by Confederate forces without a shot being fired on 26 December 1860, three months before ""Sumter.""  The fictions' other references to ""Carolina"" refer to the war after four years of pyrrhic victories and costly defeats.  It is in the late fall of 1864 that Bayard Sartoris' narration in ""The Unvanquished"" (93), ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" (59), and <em>The Unvanquished</em> (149, 89) notes that his father's troop is ""fighting"" in Carolina.  Which ""Carolina"" is not specified, but at that point in the war it's likely to be South Carolina, where Sherman and his army were completing their March to the Sea. <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> mentions Charleston in this later context: the port city is one end of the ""constricting loop"" that Union forces are drawing around the remaining Confederates during the last months of the Civil War (184).  All four of these references keep the reality of war at a distance, but in <em>Absalom!</em> Faulkner provides more graphic accounts of this part of the war.  ""Carolina"" is the place to which Henry and Bon, as part of the Confederate Army of the West, have retreated. The ""gutted mansion of a ruined aristocrat"" where, Bon tells Judith, he and his comrades found the imported stationery on which he's writing to her is undoubtedly somewhere along the line of Sherman's 'March' (102). And ""in Carolina,"" further on in the retreat and later on in the novel, is the ""pine grove"" where, amid ""the gaunt and ragged men sitting or lying about"" the ""bivouac fires"" (280), Colonel Sutpen tells his son Henry why Bon ""must not marry"" Judith (283).</p>

But it seems significant that Jason's last stop in Jefferson before setting out on his pursuit of his niece and the money she took from him is also a ""filling station"" (305).  From one point of view these two stations, both open on Easter Sunday, imply how prevalent the automobile has become as part of the culture of Mississippi by 1928.  But from another, these stations can only ""fill"" Jason's car with gas or his tires with ""air"" (305), unlike the church that Dilsey attends at the same time as Jason's trip - or the ""churches"" he ""passes"" while on the road to Mottson (306): they can fill the believers with the promise of eternal life.</p>

"1260","Historic California","","","","","","","<p>California appears in over a dozen of the fictions, in all but two of them as a state.  It seems worthwhile to describe separately the two instances which use the historic California as a setting.  In <em>Light in August</em> Calvin Burden sails to California when he runs away from his New England home at age twelve.  This is around 1820, several decades before the Gold Rush brought thousands of other Americans there.  At the time California belonged to Spain, and young Calvin's experiences are shaped by that: he ""turns Catholic"" and lives ""for a year in a monastery"" (241); it is the Catholic ""priests in California"" who teach him how to read - but only in Spanish (242).  California is briefly mentioned twice in <em>Absalom!</em>  It's speculated that the unnamed lawyer pretends to be looking for Thomas Sutpen there in the 1840s and 50s (244), and it's included on the list of places Henry Sutpen might have fled to after killing Bon in 1865 (147).  It's in between these references that California was annexed by the U.S. in 1846 and then, almost as soon as gold was discovered there, became a U.S. state in 1850.

"1261","Hollywood, California","","","","","","","<p>California figures as an ""Out of Yoknapatawpha"" location in over a dozen texts.  Given the significance of Hollywood to Faulkner himself - for over two decades he worked there often as a screenwriter - it seemed worthwhile to separate out the texts that make specific reference to that part of the state.  Hollywood has been home to the American movie industry since the 1920s.  Faulkner began working there in 1932, but never felt at home in the place.  The first time ""Hollywood"" appears in his texts is in the ""Appendix"" to <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> that he wrote in the mid-1940s.  Hollywood is where Caddy meets her second husband: he's a ""minor movingpicture magnate"" (332); they're divorced five years later.  In <em>The Mansion</em>, written after Faulkner left Hollywood for the last time in 1954, the place is used several times as a point of reference (392, 394).  The ""only sister of old Major de Spain"" lives with ""her only child"" (463) in Los Angeles.  And perhaps most pointedly, in this novel Hollywood acquires a Snopes: Montgomery Ward Snopes, who imported French pornography into Yoknapatawpa, is last seen ""engaged in some quite lucrative adjunct or correlant to the motion picture industry"" (404).  That job description is ambiguous, but it may mean Monty has gone back to dealing in pornography.  Faulkner makes two other brief references to ""Hollywood""; though neither uses Hollywood as a 'Location' in our sense of the term, they are worth noting here as part of the unglamorous pattern. <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> refers, enigmatically, to something called a ""trick Hollywood bathroom"" (123).

"1264","Varner's Mill","","","","","","","<p>It seems that Faulkner couldn't decide what was produced at the Frenchman's Bend mill owned by Will Varner.  It is referred to in three different texts.  In two of them - ""By the People"" and <em>The Mansion</em> - it's ""Uncle Bill Varner's water mill"" (347), and the site of ""the annual Varner's Mill picnic,"" a social event at which local politicians announce their candidacies (88, 326).  In the other, <em>The Town</em>, it's ""Uncle Billy Varner's saw mill"" (33), and the site of an industrial accident that cripples Eck Snopes.  The sawmills of Yoknapatawpha turn trees into lumber, one of the staples of the county's export economy.  Watermills are much more likely to turn corn into flour which would be used by the county's residents.  <em>The Town</em> mentions ""the saw-carriage"" that keeps the tree in place while being cut into boards; the other texts mention not only the mill, but the ""mill-dam"" that collects the water in the ""mill-pond"" that provides the power to drive the mill's machinery (137, 347-48).  That system wouldn't create a powerful or dependable enough source of energy for a sawmill.  None of this matters nearly as much as the fact that ""jest above the mill-pond"" there's what Ratliff calls ""a dog thicket"": ""a clump of gum and hickory and ash and pin oak switches"" (347-48); in ""By the People"" and <em>The Mansion</em> it serves the dogs in the area as a place to relieve themselves, and provides Ratliff with the urine power to drive Clarence Snopes out of politics.

This Location is the final place the shop ends up, on the grounds of the McCaslin-Edmonds plantation.

"1266","Unnamed Family's Plantation","","","","","","","<p>The plantation where Sam Fathers works is another example of how Faulkner moves his un-real estate around Yoknapatawpha.  In ""A Justice"" it belongs to the Compson family.  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> it belongs to the McCaslin-Edmonds family.  In these two intermediate stories, ""The Old People"" and ""The Bear,"" it belongs to the family of the unnamed young narrator.  Like the Compson farm, this ""plantation"" - as it is called in ""The Bear"" (293) - is situated ""four miles from Jefferson"" (""Old People,"" 203).  It includes cabins for black tenant farmers on the land, as well as the blacksmith shop where Sam worked.  In ""Old People"" it is basically identical to the Compson farm in ""A Justice,"" which explains where we locate it on our maps of the two stories.  In ""The Bear"" Faulkner adds the detail of the room inside the big house which the boy's father ""called the office"": there all of the plantation business was transacted"" and there the boy listens to ""the best of talking"" when the white men who are ""hunters"" and ""know the woods"" discuss hunting (293).  Interestingly, when Faulkner recreates this place in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, he draws a much deeper line between the 'office' - called the 'commissary' in the novel - and the woods.</p>

In <em>The Hamlet</em> Suratt travels to Ben Quick's farm from Frenchman's Bend by going to the ""river bridge"" and then ""a little more than a mile beyond it"" (91); we are assuming ""beyond"" means 'on the other side of the bridge' - which is the same side as the Bundren place - but that is a speculation.</p>

"1276","France","","","","","","","<p>Although Faulkner himself never got to the Western Front during World War I, quite a few of his characters fight or serve as non-combatants in wartime France; France during the wars of the 20th century has separate Location entries.  After they are marrried in Paris in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> Temple Drake and Gowan Stevens honeymoon at Cap Ferrat (Cape Ferrat), a very exclusive community on the Mediterranean in the south of France, in a villa built by a prince for his mistress.  Perhaps the most unlikely Yoknapatawphan to visit France is Issetibbeha, the Chickasaw chief; when he returns to Yoknapatawpha, he brings back some of the cast-offs of European culture: a gilt bed, a pair of girandoles reputedly owned by the mistress of King Louis XV, and a pair of slippers with red heels that plays an important role in the politics of the tribe (320). Similarly, but presumably with a less satiric tone, the ""Appendix"" says that much of the furniture inside the original Compson mansion was imported from France (328).  In that ""Appendix"" Faulkner brings the story of Caddy Compson to an ambiguous anti-climax in France.  Her last known address is in Paris, from which she ""vanishes"" during World War II, ""with the German occupation"" of the city in 1940 (332).  But sometime during that war the county librarian finds a photograph in ""a slick magazine"" that she is sure shows Caddy in an expensive car beside ""a German staffgeneral"" in Cannebiere (334).  Cannebiere is the name of a historic street in the old quarter of Marseilles, a city on the southern coast of France about 130 miles from Cap Ferrat. It's also almost 500 miles from that bench in the Luxembourg Gardens, where Temple's face looked ""sullen and discounted and sad"" at the end of <em>Sanctuary</em>.

Two of the ten camps on the U.S. mainland were in California; Japanese-Americans from northern California and further north were interned at Tule Lake, but it's likely that Faulkner was thinking of the camp at Manzanar, opened in March, 1942, as the first camp, and where Japanese-Americans from the Los Angeles area were taken.

"1289","Atlanta, Georgia","","","","","","","<p>The original name of Atlanta was 'Terminus,' because it was the end of the railway that was built in the 1830s to link coastal Georgia to the U.S. interior. By the time of the Civil War it was called Atlanta, and was one of the South's great railroad centers.  As part of his March to the Sea, Union General Sherman led the campaign against Atlanta that took place during the summer of 1864, which ended when Confederate forces under General Johnston finally withdrew from the city on September 2nd; according to <em>The Reivers</em>, General Compson fought in this campaign ""not too unsuccessfully as a brigadier"" (20).  Earlier, in a passage in ""Raid"" that Faulkner added when he included the story as a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Drusilla tells Bayard and Ringo a Civil War story that begins with a group of Confederate soldiers ""slipping into the roundhouse"" at a railroad center in Atlanta in order to liberate a locomotive from the Yankees. The story is based on a historical event, though it takes great liberties with history - ""Raid"" takes place before the Union Army captures Atlanta, and in the original event Faulkner is borrowing it's the Confederates who chase the Yankees, not the other way round.</p>

After his marriage to Mannie, Rider does a lot to improve the cabin, and on their wedding night he ""builds a fire on the hearth"" just as ""Uncle Lucas Beauchamp, Edmonds' oldest tenant, had done on his forty-five years ago and which had burned ever since"" (240).  Temple Stevens' poignant reference in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> calls Rider's cabin the house that he - she does not mention Rider's name - ""had rented for his wife, his marriage, his life, his old age"" (156).  But after Mannie's sudden death the cabin no longer feels like home, and when Rider returns to it after Mannie's funeral it is as an exile: walking up to the gate he realizes ""that there was nothing beyond it. The house had never been his anyway, but now even the new planks and sills and shingles, the hearth and stove and bed were all a part of the memory of somebody else"" (<em>Go Down, Moses</em>, 132-33).

"1290","Chancellorsville|The Wilderness","","","","","","","<p>Two of the major battles of the Civil War were fought near Chancellorsville in Spotsylvania County, Virginia.  The first, the Battle of Chancellorsville, took place between April 30 to May 6, 1863. According to Cass Edmonds' account of the fighting in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Union commander Joseph Hooker sits on the front gallery of a house in Chancellorsville ""drinking rum toddies and telegraphing Lincoln that he had defeated Lee"" (272). In fact the battle was a major defeat for the Union forces, although the Confederate victory was complicated by the death of Stonewall Jackson, one of the most successful generals in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia.  Jackson's surprise flank attack along ""the Plank Road"" at the end of the battle's first day routed the Union troops, though shortly afterwards Jackson himself was accidentally shot by his own troops (272).  The second occurred a year later but only a few miles away, when for the first time Ulysses S. Grant led the Union Army into action against the Army of Robert E. Lee; this was the Battle of the Wilderness, May 5-7, 1864.  Cass refers to it, though not by name, as an example of how the Southern cause was defeated by fate, or an unjust god; his evidence in this case is the way General Longstreet was also ""shot . . . by his own men in the dark by mistake just as Jackson was"" (273).  The violent battle resulted in the deaths of over 5000 men.  Longstreet, however, recovered from his wound.</p>

In <em>Absalom!</em> it is speculated that Henry Sutpen may have ""fled"" to the continent after killing Charles Bon (147).  But most of the references to ""South America"" in the fictions are in connection with the tourism of the widowed ""Mrs. Harris,"" as Melisandre Backus is called before she marries Gavin Stevens.  When World War II makes it impossible for her to keep traveling around Europe, ""it had to be South America,"" according to Charles Mallison in <em>The Mansion</em>. (282).  That trip is mentioned in both the novel and the earlier ""Knight's Gambit,"" but never described; the only place we know she visits is Argentina, where she meets ""the Argentine steeple-chasing cavalry officer"" named Sebastian Gualdres, who appears in both texts.</p>

The novel's mention of them leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  They are both Marxists, so there's no obvious reason why they would flee after the Revolution. They are called ""Finns,"" but the narrative says they escaped to the U.S. ""from Russia"" (236).   The novel never even mentions Finland by name, describing them as ""two Arctic Circle immigrants"" (237).  About one-third of Finland is inside the Circle, and the majority of the people who live in that part of the country are Lapps.  These details make it hard to know whether we should call this Location, the place these two Finnish immigrants come from, the Arctic Circle, Russia - or Finland.  The last option seems to be the least misleading one.</p>

"131","Lucas Beauchamp's Cabin","","","","","","","<p>Faulkner uses the cabin that Lucas Beauchamp lives in on the McCaslin-Edmonds plantation as a location in five different texts between 1940 and 1948. Lucas is a tenant farmer on the property in all five, but across them his character - and his cabin - become increasingly noteworthy and significant.  In ""A Point of Law"" it's not much more than the place Lucas lives, with his wife Molly and daughter Nat.  It sits uphill from the stable, and contains at least three rooms: ""the room where he and his wife slept"" (215), ""the room where his daughter slept"" (215), and a ""kitchen"" (223); it also has an unenclosed ""back porch"" (216).  The companion story ""Gold Is Not Always"" only mentions the cabin in passing.  In ""Pantaloon in Black,"" published less than four months after ""Point of Law,"" readers learn that when he married Molly, ""Uncle Lucas Beauchamp, Edmonds' oldest tenant,"" lit a fire on the cabin's hearth that has burned steadily for forty-five years (240).  And when Faulkner combined and revised these stories along with others into the 1942 novel <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, although some of the minstrel elements from the first of the stories remain, in the long ""Fire and the Hearth"" chapter he looks deeply into the racial burden that is hinted at and repressed in terms like ""Uncle Lucas"" and ""tenant.""  He makes Lucas a McCaslin too, more closely related to the patriarch who founded the Yoknapatawpha plantation than his white landlord, and in a number of scenes juxtaposes in subtle but resonant ways the distance between the inherited big house where Roth Edmonds lives and the cabin where someone like Lucas has to live.  Although he doesn't own it, it too is 'inherited' - from the racist structures of the society in which Lucas must try to be a man.  <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> goes still further, making Lucas' cabin a place where all Chick Mallison's racial assumptions, as a child of white privilege, are challenged when he spends part of a day inside it.  In this novel Lucas owns both his cabin and the ten acres of land around it.  The property was deeded to him by Roth Edmunds' father, as a belated recognition of Lucas' place in the family. Lucas' land is described as an ""oblong of earth set forever in the middle of a two thousand acre plantation like a postage stamp in the center of an envelop"" (8), and the walk up the ""half gully and half road"" that mounts to his cabin is characterized with adjectives that set Lucas as well as his property apart from Yoknapatawpha's conventional racial patterns: ""solitary independent and intractable too"" (8).  The narrative equivocates about what to call his home, using the phrase ""the house, the cabin"" when Chick first sees it (8), and the contradictory note of poverty and pride it strikes obviously confuses the twelve-year-old son of an old white family.  The adjective ""paintless"" is used seven times to in its description (8, 9), but the yard is tidy and the secondhand furnishings inside are arranged with an air of dignity.  In this novel the centerpiece of the home is the large portrait photo of Lucas and Molly in their finest clothes set in a frame of ""gold-painted wood on a gold-painted easel"" (10). Readers of ""A Rose for Emily"" see a equally formal photograph similarly displayed in the upper-class home of Emily Grierson.  Chick is confused to find such an object in a 'Negro cabin,' even more so because Molly's hair is uncovered in the picture, and he's never seen a black woman who wasn't wearing a ""headrag"" (14).  By the time Chick leaves to try to return to his old assumptions about white and black, the cabin has become the threshhold of revelation.</p>

"1310","Okatoba County","","","","","","","<p>""Okatoba County"" is a hard place to pin down.  According to ""Hand upon the Waters,"" it is ""just across"" the river that forms the southern border of Yoknapatawpha in some of the fictions, and Mottstown is its county seat (78) - though elsewhere that county is named Grenier, and in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> Mottstown is the seat of ""Mott County"" (184).  In the fantasy that Chick Mallison has in <em>Intruder</em> about Miss Habersham driving through the three counties that lie on three sides of Yoknapatawpha, ""Okatoba"" seems to lie along Yoknapatawpha's western border (184).  In ""Appendix: Compson,"" ""Okatoba"" is the site of the original Indian Agency that in other fictions is located inside the boundary of the future Yoknapatawpha County; according to that text, in 1860 Okatoba is still called ""Old Jefferson"" (328).</p>

"132","McCaslin Commissary","","","","","","","<p>Both the Sartoris plantation (in Faulkner's first Yoknatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>) and the McCaslin plantation in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> are still prosperous in the 20th century, worked by Negro tenant farmers instead of slaves.  There would have been a commissary on both of them, the plantation store where the tenants bought most of their food and supplies during the year - the 'furnish,' this was called, the white landlord 'furnishing' the items but charging them against the 'settling up' that occured in harvest time, when in addition to his share of each sharecropper's crop, the landlord collected what each tenant owed the commissary.  But <em>Flags</em> does not mention a commissary, which disguises the fact that plantations were money-making institutions.  The ""commissary"" on the De Spain plantation where the Major keeps the ""contract"" between him and his tenant Ab Snopes is mentioned in ""Barn Burning"" (16); Ab has had a lifetime of experience with landlords as capitalists, and although he is white he acknowledges that the white columns of the De Spain mansion were built mainly by the ""sweat"" of black labor (12).  The fact that a few years later Faulkner makes the commissary at the McCaslin-Edmonds place the most visible part of the plantation in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> is one way to measure how his earlier nostalgia for the Old South has given way to a determination to use his imagination to take a much harder look at the racial and class inequalities that provided the economic (and human) foundation for the plantation aristocracy.  The commissary appears in three of the short stories out of which Faulkner created <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.  In ""Gold Is Not Always"" it's the only building that the narrative ever enters.  There its nature as a store is vividly described: the ""tinned food and tobacco and patent medicines"" on its shelves and the ""trace chains and collars and hames"" that hang from hooks, and the ""roll-top desk beside the front window"" where the white landlord, Edmonds, keeps the books (226). ""Pantaloon in Black"" adds the detail of ""Edmonds' safe"" in the commissary where Rider's wife Manny does her weekly shopping (240); it serves as the tenants' bank.  In ""Go Down, Moses"" the short story, Edmonds banishes Samuel Worsham Beauchamp from the plantation after he ""catches the boy breaking into his commissary store"" (259).  But it is in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> the novel - which revises and combines these and other stories along with new material about the McCaslin family - that Faulkner does the most with the presence of the plantation commissary.  In this account, mostly in the fourth section of ""The Bear,"" the commissary ledgers reveal both the economic reality and the moral injustice of the Southern systems of slavery and tenantry.  As Ike McCaslin takes the ledgers off the shelf the first time, the narrator describes how they record ""the slow outward trickle of food and supplies and equipment which returned each fall as cotton made and ginned and sold,"" and the way this is a form of economic bondage all too similar to the slavery that tenantry has replaced: those outward and returning amounts are ""cable-strong to bind for life them who made the cotton to the land their sweat fell on"" (242).  And it is while sitting in the commissary reading the ledgers from the plantation's antebellum years that Ike learns the terrible sin his slave-holding grandfather committed, a discovery that leads him to renounce his inheritance as forever ""accursed"" (245).  The episode and its location can be compared to the scene in <em>Flags</em> where old Bayard Sartoris goes at night to the mansion's attic and, while the ghosts of ""dead Sartorises"" look over his shoulder, fondles the relics of the old plantation - including a ""rapier"" and a ""fine Mechlin"" dress - and concludes that although it's been destroyed by modern history, the Old South ""was a good gesture, anyway"" (88-89).  The ledgers Ike reads sitting in the commissary alone at night with his family's past tell a very different story.</p>

There was a moon then, their two shadows flitting broken and intermittent among the trees or slanted long and intact across the slope of pasture or old abandoned fields upon the hills"" (135-36).

"135","Swamp by Tallahatchie River","","","","","","","<p>While all the land along the Tallahatchie river is swampy, two texts refer to a specific part of it as 'a swamp.'  In ""Red Leaves,"" ""the swamp"" (333) is where ""the Negro"" takes refuge, and probably where he is bitten by a ""cottonmouth moccasin"" (338). It is small enough in area for the Indians to ""form a circle"" around it, which is how they finally capture him (337).  It's interesting to think about how close in Faulkner's imagination this location is to the ""cave under the river back"" in <em>Absalom!</em> that is ""thirteen miles from Sutpen's camp"" where the pursuers finally overtake that other antebellum fugitive, the French architect.  We can only speculate, but if the architect runs east, the two places are probably close.  On the other hand, it's less speculative to identify this swamp as either the same or very close to the swamp in ""Pantaloon in Black"" where  the moonshiner lives, and where Rider buys a jug of whiskey and wanders restlessly between ""the close walls of impenetrable cane-stalks"" (247).</p>

Throughout the Yoknapatawpha fictions, segregation meant that black and white children attended different schools; although in ""There Was a Queen"" Isom mentions what he has learned in the school he attended, this schoolhouse in rural Yoknapatawpha and the school that Aleck Sander goes to in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> are the only two 'Negro schools' used as Locations.

"141","Choctaw|Chickasaw Plantation","","","","","","","<p>Faulkner uses the Indian settlement at the northern edge of what (about the same time the Indians themselves were removed) became known as 'Yoknapatawpha County' as the setting for three stories: ""Red Leaves,"" ""A Justice"" and ""A Courtship.""  The narrators of these stories and (in some cases) the Indians themselves refer to the settlement as a ""plantation.""  The word 'plantation' pre-dates American slavery, and can refer to any large estate or new colony, but of course in Faulkner's world it is deeply saturated with the slave-owning economy of the Old South.  One way to read the Choctaw plantation described in ""Red Leaves"" - about a slave trying to escape his fate at the hands of the people who claim to own him - is as the imaginative screen onto which Faulkner can project his earliest fictional representation of slavery.  No white people appear in the story, but the plantation itself reveals the presence of the white settlers who have brought slavery into the Indians' world: the Choctaws have built a ""quarters"" (313), even ""putting the young Negroes in the cabins in pairs to mate"" (320) and increase the tribe's wealth; in an attempt to imitate the 'big house' of a Southern slave plantation the chief's house includes ""the deck house"" of a wrecked steamboat that had been hauled overland (317), and inside it are several artifacts European civilization which Issetibbeha, one of the chiefs, brought back into the woods of north Mississippi from a trip to Paris - including a ""gilt bed"" and ""a pair of girandoles"" (320).  The plantation sits ""in the center of ten thousand acres of matchless parklike forest where deer grazed like domestic cattle"" (318); some of the woods have already been cleared by the slaves and ""planted in grain"" (320).  In ""A Courtship"" Faulkner imaginatively goes back earlier in the history of these fictional Indians, who are now identified as Chickasaws.  These ""old days"" (380) seem almost pre-lapsarian, antedating the arrival of slavery.  Although a steamboat has already begun paying annual visits to the community for the purposes of trade, and one white man is a major character, there is no mention of slaves or quarters or cleared fields among the Indians prior to ""the eight new slaves"" that Ikkemotubbe brings with him three years after the main events of the story (363).</p>

The two rows of houses face each other. They have no doors and have ""chinked and plastered chimneys"" (313), and a dirt lane runs between them. The central cabin with its shuttered windows is larger than the others, big enough, apparently, to hold all the slaves on the plantation. Inside, it is dark with a hearth in center of the floor, and a hole in the roof for smoke. The room also contains the slaves' ""cryptic ornaments"" and ""ceremonial records"" (315).  In the lane are ""a few homemade toys mute in the dust"" (313).</p>

"145","Doom's Plantation House","","","","","","","<p>Faulkner mentions the 'mansion house' at the Indian plantation twice, in ""Red Leaves"" and again in ""A Justice.""  According to the second story, Doom never thought the chief's ""House"" was ""big enough (350), so he compelled the rest of the tribe and the slaves it owns to move a piece of a wrecked steamboat out of the river and twelve miles over land to make it bigger.  ""Red Leaves"" describes this addition in the most detail.  It is the one-story ""deck house"" from the steamboat set on a ""knoll, surrounded by oak trees"";  ""chipped and flaked gilding"" and ""rococo cornices"" adorn the house and the ""gilt lettering of the stateroom names above the jalousied doors"" can still be seen (317).   Inside it are several artifacts European civilization which Issetibbeha, one of the chiefs, brought back into the woods of north Mississippi from a trip to Paris: ""a pair of girandoles"" that reputedly once belonged to the mistress of a French King (320), a ""gilt bed"" that no one will sleep in (320, 325), and a ""pair of slippers with red heels"" that are too small for anyone to wear (320) - though possession of them becomes an important issue in tribal and familial politics.  In the chronology of Faulkner's career, this decadent 'steamboat-mansion' built with enslaved labor predates his description of the huge house that Sutpen employs a French architect to design, stuffed with fancy furniture that reminds at least one character in <em>Absalom!</em> of ""the whole durn steamboat!""

"146","New Orleans, Louisiana","","","","","","","<p>Faulkner lived in New Orleans in 1925 and 1926, and the city provides the setting for a number of his non-Yoknapatawpha novels, including <em>Mosquitoes</em>, <em>Pylon</em>, and <em>The Wild Palms</em>.  It is also used as a setting or mentioned in 16 Yoknapatawpha fictions, putting it almost as high as Memphis on the frequency list of 'OutOfYoknapatawpha' Locations.  It is in fact often associated with Memphis; when in <em>The Reivers</em>, for example, Lucius Priest hears Boon mention ""<em>New Orleans</em>,"" he says he should have immediately realized that Boon's scheme involves an illicit trip to the closer city of Memphis (44) - because both places are associated with moral truancy.  <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> also links New Orleans to Memphis as the two places where even Yoknapatawphans who don't do much traveling are likely to go - to misbehave during ""a few prolonged Saturday nights"" (205).  When the Indian chief Doom visits the city in ""Red Leaves,"" much of his time there is spent ""among the gamblers and cutthroats of the river front"" (317).  Popeye, the Memphis gangster in <em>Sanctuary</em>, lived earlier in New Orleans.  The husband of Melisandre Backus in ""Knight's Gambit,"" <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em> is described in the last novel as ""a New Orleans underworld bigshot"" (216).  When Doom makes his visit, New Orleans is ""a European city"" (317) - originally settled by the Spanish, then ceded to France, it has only recently been acquired by the young U.S. in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.  Its architecture as well as its social life retain this 'Creole' history, a term which in the Southern racial context has implications of interracial sex.  In ""Red Leaves"" Doom impregnates the ""daughter of a fairly well-to-do West Indian family"" (318); when the story of his trip is re-told in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the pregnant woman is a ""quadroon"" (158). That word connects the New Orleans of the Indian stories with the ""New Orleans"" that appears in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> The quotation marks are to indicate how much the city that appears in <em>Absalom!</em> is the product of the imaginations of its various white story-tellers, none of whom, as far as can be determined, has ever been to New Orleans.  ""New Orleans"" is most elaborately evoked by Mr. Compson in Chapter 4, during his reconstruction of the visit Bon and Henry Sutpen pay to the city on the eve of the Civil War. New Orleans already had a reputation as a sensuous place, but Compson's account oozes sexuality. The city's architecture is ""a little curious, a little femininely flamboyant and therefore to Henry opulent, sensuous, sinful"" (87). The remainder of his account is a heavily guided tour through a realm of aristocratic pleasures. The stops include: the city's public spaces (""the flash and glitter of a myriad carriage wheels,"" ""women, enthroned"" and ""men in linen a little finer and diamonds a little brighter,"" 88); the private auction house in which mixed-race women are sold as concubines (""a neighborhood a little decadent,"" the place ""invested . . . with something of secret and curious and unimaginable delights,"" 89); the adjacent enclosed dueling ground, with ""only the most recent of the brown stains showing"" (90); the living quarters of the ""quadroon"" Compson calls Bon's mistress and her child: ""a place created for and by voluptuousness"" (91).  Faulkner's imagination again connects ""New Orleans"" with transgressive sexuality in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, when Carothers McCaslin travels to the city in 1807 to purchase an enslaved woman named Eunice for an extravagant amount of money.  Henry Sutpen is made extremely uncomfortable by the racial-sexual world he is exposed to in the city.  What Ike McCaslin, the grandson of Old Carothers, learns about his grandfather and Eunice is still more devastating.  It was in New Orleans, by the way, that Ikkemotubbe acquired the subriquet ""Doom.""</p>

The ""Big River"" is the Mississippi.  Steamboats regularly stopped at places between ports for freight or passengers or fuel to drive their paddlewheels - this last is why ""Red Leaves"" calls the place Doom disembarks a ""wood landing on the north Mississippi side"" (318). (Characters in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> still use the river to travel between New Orleans and Yoknapatawpha both before and after the Civil War; in that text, however, there is no mention of the place where they get on or off the steamboats.)</p>

But the expectant emptiness of that hole looms over the entire story, as the slave who is slated for sacrifice runs from it and the tribe chases him down.  Captured, the slave is being taken toward the grave as the story ends.  (Faulkner treats this burial ritual as an Indian custom; Issetibbeha's father, Ikkemotubbe, was buried with <em>his</em> horse, dog and Negro ""servant,"" as the slave is often labeled.  Some world cultures have put people to death as part of a leader's last rites. However, there is no evidence of any such practice among the Indians of North America.  Interestingly, many of the aboriginal peoples in northern Mississippi built mounds as burial sites.  There are ""Indian mounds"" in several Faulkner fictions, but neither in ""Red Leaves"" nor anywhere else does he associate the mounds with cemeteries.  When another Indian Chief dies in ""A Justice,"" the narrator twice refers to his body ""entering the earth,"" but there is no direct reference to how or where he is buried, <em>Collected Stories</em>, 350).</p>

"155","Tallahatchie River Bottom","","","","","","","<p>In the vernacular of Faulkner's Mississippi, a creek or river 'bottom' is the low land along its banks. This terrain is characterized by swampy wetland, 'sloughs' full of stagnant water and dense undergrowth. A great many scenes in the fictions take place in 'bottoms' in various parts of Yoknapatawpha, including the banks of the river that forms the county's northern boundary.  On his 1936 map Faulkner labels this the Tallahatchie, the real river that forms most of the Lafayette County's northern boundary.  The Tallahatchie bottom includes the 'Big Bottom,"" the extensive wilderness in northwest Yoknapatawpha that is the site of Faulkner's major hunting stories.  The earliest first hunting scenes in the fictions, however, occur upriver in the county's northeastern corner: in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Faulkner's first Yoknapatawpha fiction, Bayard Sartoris and Buddy MacCallum hunt game in that area.  The game in the bottoms are deer and bear, but human beings are also hunted along this river.  In ""Vendee,"" for example, an earlier Bayard Sartoris and his slave/companion Ringo pursue the white outlaw Grumby along the ""old road"" that runs through this bottom, and ultimately capture and kill him there (110, 177).  'Pursuit' is a very prevalent motif in Faulkner's texts, though Ringo is one of the few black characters who ever chase a white one.  In three other instances the chase along this 'bottom' has even more complex historical and racial undertones.  ""Red Leaves"" is organized around Faulkner's most overt description of the pursuit of a runaway slave.  The unnamed enslaved protagonist runs back and forth over thirty miles of this ""creek bottom"" (331) before he is captured and brought back to ""the plantation"" (339).  The people who own him and chase him are Choctaw Indians, and the plantation is an Indian community.  Fugitive people are hunted in the ""bottom"" again in Faulkner's next 'Indian story,' ""A Justice,"" when ""the People,"" the entire tribe of Indians, tries to hide ""in the creek bottom"" from Doom, their chief, and the hard labor he is forcing upon them; in this story Doom uses dogs to find them (350).  Dogs are also used in Chapter 7 of <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> when a group of white men and slaves chase Thomas Sutpen's captive French architect along this ""river bottom"" for two days (177).  The architect  is finally re-captured trying to hide in ""a cave under the river bank"" (177); this event is referred to again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> (33).  There's a second episode in ""A Justice"" that can also be seen as part of this pattern.  After the Indians use ten of their slaves as capital to purchase the 'rights' to the wrecked steamboat on the Tallahatchie from three white men, Herman Basket and Crawford ""overtake"" the whites somewhere in the bottom, kill them, and take the slaves back to the tribe.  The Indians are not typical 'slave owners' and neither the People nor the architect nor the three whites nor the ten slaves are typical 'fugitive slaves,' but it is interesting to consider how these episodes may be related to the many 'slave hunts' that recur in both historical and fictional accounts of slavery.  (The one time in the fiction when a white slave owner pursues a black runaway slave is in ""Was,"" the opening chapter of <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, but there the conventional representation is complicated - euphemized? - by the fact that the slave is the half-brother of the slave-owner, that he runs away to the same place every six months or so, that the white owner puts on a tie before beginning the chase and so on; the 'freedom' that's at stake is the white man's, who is in danger of being forced into a marriage.)</p>

"156","Place where Slaves Drum on Indian Plantation","","","","","","","<p>The enslaved Negroes on the Choctaw plantation in ""Red Leaves"" hide their drums ""in the creek bottom,"" ""on the bank of a slough"" (328).  The drums are used in what seems to be part of a regularly enacted tribal ritual, although story does not explain why they feel it is necessary to hide the drums from the Indians who have enslaved them, or the meaning of the ritual.  While the protagonist of the story, also a slave, hides in the barn while waiting for his master to die, he listens to the drumming.  He imagines that the scene is dark, with the ""black limbs"" of the men ""turning"" in a dance while the women nurse their young (329). After he runs away, ""the sound of the drums"" brings him back, briefly, to this spot - but while the story describes the drums as they continue to play during his conversation with the ""headman,"" it does not provide any more details about the ritual that the drumming is part of (332).  The story merely uses the drumming to provide a soundtrack for the encounter.</p>

"157","On the Atlantic Ocean","","","","","","","<p>The Atlantic Ocean is the scene of events involving characters in two fictions.  Both are traveling to America, but in very different circumstances.  When Horace Benbow returns from France at the end of World War I in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, his inept experiments with glassblowing start a fire in his cabin on the liner he's a passenger on.  The situation remains comic, but the captain asks him to stop until they reach land, ""what with all the men on board"" (158). This last detail suggests the liner is currently serving as a troop ship, though Horace himself was a noncombatant.  In ""Red Leaves,"" the enslaved protagonist recalls what is usually referred to as the 'Middle Passage,' when he spent ""ninety days in a three-foot-high tween-deck in tropical latitudes"" during the crossing, as part of the 'cargo' of enslaved people bound for the U.S. (330).  From within that confined space he can hear ""the drunken New England captain"" reading the Bible aloud (330).</p>

In ""Tomorrow"" Quick's mill has Negro workers and a ""boiler"" (unlike for example Varner's 'water mill' elsewhere in the Bend), and it ""shuts down for the winter"" when the ""bottom,"" which is where the trees are, ""gets wet"" - which would make it difficult to get the trees that have been felled out of the bottom and to the mill (103).  <em>The Hamlet</em> mentions the mill's ""sawdust pile,"" where part of the trees always ends up (78).

"162","Rouncewell's Boarding House|Commercial Hotel","","","","","","","<p>This is one of several boarding houses in Jefferson that appear in different texts.  In Faulkner's last book, <em>The Reivers</em>, he calls it the Commercial Hotel, locates it ""across town from the Holston House"" - a higher class establishment (25), and provides it with a very colorful history.  In 1905, when the main events of the novel take place, it's where Boon Hogganbeck lives along with jurors in town for trials and ""horse- and mule-traders"" (25).  In subsequent eras it becomes ""the Snopes Hotel,"" then, for a brief but presumably flamboyant time, it's known to ""the police as Little Chicago,"" and still later to the town as ""Mrs. Rouncewell's boarding house,"" which is apparently what it is still called at the time the story is being told, around 1961 (25-6).  In his previous novel, <em>The Mansion</em>, Faulkner describes it as an ""unpainted two-storey building on a back street"" (35) that Mrs. Rouncewell herself ""calls the Commercial Hotel"" while ""all the rest of Yoknapatawpha County"" calls it ""the Rouncewell boarding house"" (143). In this text Flem Snopes owns it <em>after</em> her.  In ""Tomorrow,"" the short story that is the first text to mention it, its is simply Mrs. Rouncewell's boarding house, though being used in the narrative as a place for the jury in the Bookwright trial to deliberate, since it's where they are staying.

"167","Negro Hollow|Freedman Town","","","","","","","<p>Many of the blacks who work as domestics for the upper class families in Jefferson live in cabins behind their employers' big houses, but the larger Negro population of the town is mostly concentrated in a district variously named ""Freedman Town (<em>Light in August</em>, 114),"" ""The Hollow"" (<em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, 38), and - using an offensive term that reminds us which race got to decide what to call people and places in Yoknapatawpha - ""Nigger Hollow"" (<em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, 302).  Actually, <em>Intruder</em> refers to ""the Hollow and Freedmantown,"" suggesting that they are two different places.  This was the case for the black population in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, and a good case can be made for putting two 'Negro districts' on the map of Jefferson. (See for example Charles S. Aiken's map in <em>William Faulkner and the Southern Landscape</em>, 13). But except for that phrase in <em>Intruder</em> the fictions never make such a distinction explicit, and an equally good case can be made for the conclusion that all the descriptions of the black part of Jefferson refer to the same section of town, more or less exactly where Oxford's Freedmen Town was during Faulkner's time.  That was in an area between the Square and the railroad tracks.  In ""Knight's Gambit"" Charles Mallison sees this ""shabby purlieu"" of Jefferson from the window of his train as he returns to town during World War II: its ""Negro cabins"" are ""awry: not out of plumb [but] beyond plumb,"" set amidst a ""miniature jungle of vegetable patch,"" ""flimsy and make-shift, alien yet inviolably durable"" (252-53).  It is set considerably <em>below</em> the plateau on which the Square and most of the town itself are built.  When Dilsey and her family, with Benjy, pass through this section on their way to church: ""A street turned at right angles, descending, and became a dirt road.  On either hand the land dropped more sharply; a broad flat dotted with small cabins whose weathered roofs were on a level with the crown of the road""; on the ""small grassless plots littered with broken things"" grow ""rank weeds"" and ""trees that partake of the foul disiccation which surrounded the houses"" (<em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, 290-91).  The most vivid account of the district describes it from the perspective of Joe Christmas as he walks through it in the dark - including, symbolically, the darkness of his own profound uncertainty about his racial identity.  As he descends into it, the unpaved, often rutted roads and lanes are lit by streetlights that ""seem to be further spaced"" than in other sections of Jefferson, emphasizing rather than dispelling the darkness (114).  Small cabins, felt rather than seen by Joe as ""cabinshapes,"" are built into the neighborhood's hollows and hills; they are lighted by kerosene rather than electricity.  While there, Christmas senses ""invisible negroes"" that ""enclose"" him, suggesting that the neighborhood is densely populated and noisy with human activity (114).  A deep ravine runs through the middle of it, which the narrative refers to as the ""abyss itself"" (116). We assume it is also the location of Aunt Rachel's Cabin and Nancy's Cabin in ""That Evening Sun"" as well as the Negro Cabin Where Murder Occurs in <em>Sanctuary</em> - these all have separate entries in this index.</p>

"169","Jefferson Baptist Church","","","","","","","<p>Baptists are one of the four main Protestant groups in Jefferson, along with Presbyterians, Methodists and Episcopalians.  Five unnamed Baptist ministers are mentioned in various texts, but only two fictions refer to the Baptist church as a location, and neither uses it as the location for an event, so it is never described.  The closest thing to a description is the account in <em>The Mansion</em> of Flem Snopes' contribution to the church as part of his plan to achieve respectability: the novel notes ""the outward and augmented physical aspect of the edifice"" which his money has paid for (461).  On the other hand, a church with Flem inside it should probably be seen as a whited sepulcher.  The only other member of the Baptist congregation mentioned by name is Mr. Stovall in ""That Evening Sun,"" the deacon in the church who kicks Nancy in the mouth when she publicly rebukes him for not paying her for sex the last ""three times"" (291).  This behavior does not prevent the Baptist minister in <em>Sanctuary</em> from preaching a sermon that, according to Horace Benbow's second-hand account, says that Lee Goodwin and Ruby Lamar ""should both be burned"" as adulterers (128).</p>

On the other hand, the ""hotel"" mentioned in <em>Sanctuary</em> and the ""hotel"" mentioned in ""Dry September"" are both on the Square, and cater to ""drummers"" (traveling salesman), and in either or both cases might be the Holston House, Jefferson's main hotel - but that name isn't used.

It leads to the MacCallum place, the McCaslin place, ""Beat Four"" (and a dozen specific Locations in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>); it takes Jason Compson as far as he gets from his house in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> - which isn't far.  According to our calculations, it's where Bayard Sartoris (in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>) has his first car accident.  As he is being taken toward town, the wagon goes down ""a final hill, and the road emerged from the shade and crossed the flat treeless valley"" (218). Chick Mallison is being driven on the road in the other direction in ""Tomorrow,"" where he describes the journey this way: ""We were in the hills now, out of the rich flat land, among the pine and bracken, the poor soil, the little tilted and barren patches of gaunt corn and cotton which somehow endured, as the people they clothed and fed somehow endured; the roads we followed less than lanes, winding and narrow, rutted and dust choked, the car in second gear half the time"" (94-95).

Like the entire Sartoris plantation, it's intact and prosperous through the middle of the 20th century, despite the threats of time and loss, and is mentioned in 6 different texts. Five of these are set during the Civil War.  In ""My Grandmother Millard"" Colonel Sartoris uses the pasture to drill the Confederate regiment he has raised from the local population.  In ""Ambuscade"" and ""Retreat"" Bayard and Ringo run across the pasture to get away from the Union soldiers they've shot at while guarding the plantation during the Colonel's absence at the war.  In ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" the ladies of Jefferson ""look out across the pasture toward the bottom"" in search of Drusilla, whom they suspect of having lost her virginity (64-65, 197).  Almost seventy years later Narcissa Benbow Sartoris is seen crossing the pasture in ""There Was a Queen"" to get to the creek bottom herself.  In a sense she's running from something too - she tries to wash away the sex she gave the F.B.I. agent in exchange for the letters that Byron Snopes had sent her in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  One of the 'ladies' who see her coming back wet is black - Elnora - and the other is the 'queen' of the story's title, Aunt Jenny.

It's not always named, but when it is it is - as in the title of one of the Faulkner's stories about the Sartorises during the Civil War - it is called ""Harrykin Creek,"" although officially it's Hurricane Creek (a real creek in Lafayette County).  It first appears in those stories as the location of the livestock pen that Colonel Sartoris builds in order to hide his animals from the Yankee army.  The land along the creek - called a ""bottom"" in the local dialect - is densely overgrown; as Bayard Sartoris notes in <em>The Unvanquished</em>: ""you could not have found [the pen] unless you had known where to look, and you could not have seen it until you came to the new sap-sweating, axe-ended rails woven through and into the jungle growth itself"" (11).  In ""My Grandmother Millard and General Bedford Forrest and the Battle of Harrykin Creek,"" the location is used as the site for a fictional battle, 'fought' to make a marriage possible. (Although the ""Battle of Harrykin Creek"" is a fiction within a fiction, at the real Hurricane Creek the remains of Confederate trenches from 1864 can still be seen.) After the war, in ""Skirmish at Sartoris,"" the creek bottom becomes the site for harvesting cypress and oak trees to mill into lumber to rebuild the Sartoris mansion house; the site contains a ""bandsaw"" powered by a ""blind-folded mule going round and round in the sawdust"" (195, 64).  In other fictions the swampy land at the creek is where a militia band captures an outlaw band and sets in motion the events that lead to Jefferson getting it's name (""A Name for the City,"" <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>); the creek provides the water in which Narcissa Sartoris tries to wash away her shame, prompting Miss Jenny facetiously to call it ""Jordan at the back of a country pasture"" (""There Was a Queen,"" 741) and the ice-covered water into which Aleck Sander jumps on a dare (<em>The Town</em>); and the dense undergrowth of the bottom helps Mink Snopes sneak into Jefferson on his revenge mission (<em>The Mansion</em>).

(11, 27) - this is how Bayard Sartoris tells Miss Rosa about the Yankee soldier he and Ringo fired upon in ""Ambuscade.""  They didn't really kill him, but Bayard's phrase provides an interested echo of the mystery that begins <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, which Faulkner was writing at the same time as ""Ambuscade.""  In the novel it's Henry Sutpen who does shoot his sister's ""fiance to death before the gates to the house"" (6).  At Sartoris, as at other plantations in the fictions, there is a formal gate at the entrance to the drive that leads to the big house.  In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Colonel Sartoris displays the chivalrous behavior that is supposed to accompany the formal elegance of the planter class when this gate appears a second time.  In ""Retreat,"" he and his mother-in-law Rosa reach the gate from opposite directions, arriving at the same time.  As Bayard describes it, ""Father stopped us at the gate with his hat raised while the wagon went in first"" (32, 70).  There's another echo here, because in <em>Absalom!</em> Mr. Compson points out to Quentin that Sutpen's imitation of this behavior - ""that florid, swaggering gesture to the hat"" - reveals that unlike the Compsons or the Benbows (or, of course, the Sartorises), Sutpen ""was underbred"" (34).</p>

A ""springhouse"" is a small building constructed over a spring; since spring water can be cool even in summer, spring houses were typically where milk or other dairy products could be kept.  Uncle Cal's spring house is presumably where he makes his moonshine whisky - what Stevens calls Bookwright's ""stuff"" (190) - or at least where he keeps in cool.</p>

"187","Judge Stevens'|Gavin Stevens' Office","","","","","","","<p>Gavin Stevens, one of Faulkner's favorite characters, practices law and serves Yoknapatawpha as the County Attorney in the same law office his father used before him, though the only time it is Judge Stevens' office is in Faulkner's last book, <em>The Reivers</em>.  There it is located ""just down the gallery from Doctor Peabody's"" office (14); as is standard with the offices around Jefferson's Courthouse Square, this ""gallery"" runs outside along the second floor of a commercial building (which according to <em>The Mansion</em> contains the hardware store), and is reached by an outside set of stairs. In 9 earlier fictions quite a few people climb those stairs to meet with Gavin.  <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, for example, mentions the steady stream of ""officials from the city hall, and justices of the peace and bailiffs"" who visit on county business (263, 360).  In that novel it is also where Mollie Beauchamp, the aged black grandmother of Samuel Worsham Beauchamp, seeks out Gavin's help in bringing her grandson home.  Much of Flem's story in the Snopes trilogy is told when Gavin, his nephew Charles and V.K. Ratliff discuss it in this office, and it's where in the trilogy's middle volume Flem's wife Eula visits Gavin at night just before taking her own life.  Outside its window, according to <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, is a mulberry tree which helps keep it cool.  Its interior is described in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> as cluttered with ""dogeared faded [and] stacked untidy papers"" (29).</p>

"188","Vicksburg, Mississippi","","","","","","","<p>Although a small city, Vicksburg played a big role in the Civil War.  Located on steep bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River, it was a strategically important Confederate stronghold, especially after it became the last point on the river to remain outside Union control. That made it the target of several major campaigns, including a naval assault led by Admiral David Farragut that began in May 1862 and continued into June and July of that year, and the army campaign led by General Ulysses S. Grant that lasted over half a year.  It ended when, after a 47-day seige, the Confederate garrison surrendered on the symbolic date of July 4, 1863, giving the North command of the whole Mississippi River and control of the war's western theater.  It is in this context that Vicksburg appears in <em>The Unvanquished</em> stories.  The first written of these, ""Ambuscade,"" may begin just after the fall of Vicksburg - though the project's editors are divided on that date.  The last written, ""My Grandmother Millard,"" takes place earlier, allowing Faulkner's narrator - and perhaps in a moment of Southern nostalgia Faulkner himself - to call Vicksburg ""all we had left of the River"" (669).  In the <em>Go Down, Moses</em> stories, both the bi-racial Nat Beauchamp and Roth McCaslin's bi-racial mistress have aunts who live in the city, and in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> the oldest son of Nub Gowrie is the ""manager of a delta cotton plantation"" near Vicksburg (160).  Finally, near the end of ""Race at Morning,"" Faulkner's last short story, the young narrator acknowledges how he came to live with ""Mister Ernest"" - because his mother ""went off with the Vicksburg roadhouse feller"" (307).</p>

"190","Tennessee","","","","","","","<p>The state of Tennessee is about 60-70 miles north of the fictional location of Yoknapatawpha County. When Memphis is counted along with the rest of the state, over half the Yoknapatawpha fictions include scenes in or mentions of Tennessee, but Memphis has its own Location entry in the index, as does 'Tennessee in the Civil War,' which figures in 7 fictions.  The rest of the state is mentioned or used as the scene of events in 10 fictions.  Real Tennessee places Faulkner mentions are: Bolivar, one of the towns where Hawkshaw works as a barber in ""Hair""; Jackson and Saulsbury - the first is the destination of the furniture dealer in <em>Light in August</em> and the second the place where the novel ends, with Lena Grove riding in the dealer's truck and expressing her pleasure that just two months after leaving Alabama, ""now it's already Tennessee"" (507); and Columbia, where V.K. Ratliff meets one of his kinsmen.  Several characters move to Yoknapatawpha from Tennessee, including Goodhue Coldfield in <em>Absalom!</em>, Philip Backhouse in ""My Grandmother Millard,"" and presumably - although it is not explicitly stated - V.K. Ratcliffe in <em>The Town</em>.  In ""Vendee"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em> the outlaw Matt Bowden tells Bayard Sartoris, Ringo and Buck McCaslin that he is a plantation owner from Tennessee - there is no reason, however, to believe him.  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> Ike McCaslin traces one of his grandfather's illegitimate bi-racial grandchildren - Tennie's Jim, who escaped from slavery in 1864 - as far as Tennessee, but loses his trail there.</p>

We assume that the ""road to Memphis"" on which, in ""Tomorrow,"" Buck Thorpe is caught driving a small herd of stolen cattle (90) is probably the same road; like Popeye, Buck has a good (which is to say, a bad) reason for wanting to take a back way north from Frenchman's Bend.  On that basis we also assume it's the road over which about fifteen years earlier, Isham Quick and the Thorpe brothers ride to the Fentrys' farm, and also on which, two or three years later, Gavin and Chick drive from Pruitts' farm to Frenchman's Bend as they trace Thorpe's and Fentry's history.</p>

"199","Arkansas","","","","","","","<p>Arkansas is directly across the Mississippi River from Mississippi.  The ""company"" of Confederate troops camped outside Jefferson in ""Retreat"" and <em>The Unvanquished</em> come from the state (20, 46).  Only four people from Yoknapatawpha go there.  When Ike McCaslin goes looking for his cousin Fonsiba Beauchamp in Midnight, Arkansas, in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the difficulties of travel in the state are formidable: he journeys ""by rail,"" ""by contracted stage,"" ""by rail again,"" and on horseback, through what is described as a kind of wasteland - ""empty,"" ""muddy,"" night after night in ""hotels, in roadside taverns of rough logs and containing little else but a bar,"" ""in the cabins of strangers and the hay of lonely barns"" (263).  Like Ike, Fonsiba is a grandchild of Old Carothers McCaslin, but her genealogy is extra-marital and bi-racial.  She left Yoknapatawpha after being emancipated at the end of the Civil War and is now living with her husband, a Northern Negro, on what he claims is a farm near that ominously named town.  The farm is described as ""a single log edifice with a clay chimney . . . no barn, no stable, not so much as a hencoop: just a log cabin built by hand . . . a farm only in embryo"" (264). Midnight itself contains a tavern, a livery stable, a big store, a saloon, a blacksmith shop - and a bank, where Ike can leave Fonsiba's thousand-dollar McCaslin bequest in the hands of a white banker who promises to pay it to her in monthly installments that will guarantee it lasts for decades.  The bleakness of this episode seems meant to comment more on what ""freedom"" might mean to Negroes (265) than on ""Arkansas"" as a place.  The two other Yoknapatawphans who spend time in Arkansas are Buddy MacCallum (in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>) and Pete Grier (in ""Two Soldiers"") and even though they go there almost 25 years apart, they probably go to the same place: a U.S. Army boot camp.  The novel calls the place Buddy goes after enlisting to fight in World War I a ""concentration camp"" (355), a phrase that would acquire a much different meaning during World War II.  That is the war Pete enlists to fight in; he leaves Memphis, Tennessee, as part of a detachment of new recruits being taken to ""Little Rock"" (95).  Other fictions also establish this connection between Arkansas and Memphis.  In <em>Light in August</em> Joe Christmas' grandfather kidnaps him from an orphanage in Memphis to try to place him in an orphanage in Little Rock, Arkansas. To Joe, this other orphanage looks ""no different from the one they left"" (140).   In <em>The Reivers</em> Otis complains about ""all that time I wasted in Arkansas before anybody ever told me about Memphis"" (139).    Otis is one of two characters in that novel from Arkansas; the other is Miss Corrie, who is both an orphan and one of the prostitutes who work for Miss Reba in Memphis.  She and Otis are both from the fictional small town of Kiblett, Arkansas.  And it is inside Miss Reba's brothel that Arkansas is mentioned in <em>The Mansion</em>: the real town of Lonoke, Arkansas, is where the sister or daughter or wife of an unsavory patron named Strutterbuck lives (90-91).  The state appears in a different context in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, when the narrator measures how 20th century America is becoming ""one nation"" (rather than a North and a South) by noting the ""Brooklyn exchange students"" who attend college on the G.I. bill ""at Mississippi or Arkansas or Texas universities"" and sell ""tiny confederate battle flags"" at football games (194).</p>

"200","Texas","","","","","","","<p>Texas plays a quasi-mythical role in Yoknapatawpha's history.  While most of the people in the county arrive there from the East, there are two sets of inhabitants who come east to Yoknapatawpha from Texas.  Four different fictions tell the story of the ""spotted horses"" that Flem Snopes brings to Frenchman's Bend from Texas, and that the hapless men who buy them unleash upon the county.  The horses are invariably associated with a kind of frontier violence and wildness, but they are not the most dangerous creatures who come to Yoknapatawpha from Texas.  That label has to be given to the four unnamed children of Bryon Snopes and a Jicarilla Apache; these unnamed kids travel from El Paso to Jefferson and proceed to terrify the community - until the town manages to ship them back to El Paso.  The most pervasive way in which ""Texas"" inhabits the story and the sensibility of Yoknapatawpha, however, is as a place to go <em>to</em> - to run away to, when you've done something wrong.  The chronologically earliest times the state is defined this way occur in <em>Absalom!</em>, first when the town speculates about the way Thomas Sutpen has acquired the expensive furnishings for his mansion and concludes that it must have been by the kind of act that, if he'd been caught at it, would have meant changing his name ""and moving to Texas"" (208); similarly, the town speculates that after killing Charles Bon, Sutpen's son Henry ""fled to Texas"" or someplace even further away (147).  The father's action occurs in 1836, the year Texas declared its independence from Mexico; it became a U.S. state in 1845, and at the time Henry might have fled there it was a member of the Confederate States.  But it remains associated with flight throughout the fictions.  When it's learned that the unmarried Eula Varner is pregnant, for example, some of her suitors reportedly take off for Texas, and after she is married to Flem Snopes, the newlyweds spend a year in Texas to hide the illegitimate birth - which is when Flem acquires those ponies.  Two of the worst outlaws in the fictions, members of Grumby's gang in <em>The Unvanquished</em> named Matt Bowden and Bridger, are ""going to Texas"" when they are last seen (113).  Byron Snopes is last seen heading east after robbing the Sartoris bank in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, but according to <em>The Town</em> he too ends up in Texas.  There are other instances of this pattern in the fictions; according to Don H. Doyle, so many northern Mississippians migrated or fled there that in the antebellum period the abbreviation 'GTT' - gone to Texas - regularly appears in civic records (<em>Faulkner's County</em>, 84).   In <em>The Hamlet</em> Jack Houston is running away from the expectation that he'll marry his childhood sweetheart rather than anything more sinister when he goes west; much of his time away from Yoknapatawpha is spent in Texas, in particular in Galveston and El Paso.  And two different Yoknapatawphans are in uniform when they travel to Texas: Pap notes in ""Two Soldiers"" that he was ""drafted and sent clean to Texas"" during the first World War (85); Charles Mallison goes to Texas for pilot training during the Second World War (252).  Yet another mythic aspect of 'Texas' is evoked in ""Uncle Willy,"" when Willy's sister marries a man who is both a Texan and ""an oil millionaire"" (225).</p>

His farm is a location in 2 of these, though it is an example of how willing Faulkner is to move his un-real estate around.  The first time the farm appears, in <em>Light in August</em>, it is on the road by which Lena Grove enters Yoknapatawpha after her four weeks' journey from Alabama.  In that text the farm is still a good distance from Frenchman's Bend.  But in <em>The Hamlet</em>, where it is mentioned as the place where Lump Snopes is getting his room and board, the farm is very close to Varner's store in the heart of the Bend (388).

Sawmills turn trees into boards, and are usually set up near the forests that are being cut down for lumber.  A planing mill shapes the rough boards into more finished pieces of wood, though it is an industrial rather than an artisanal process.  This one is on the edge of Jefferson. As a Location, this contains several distinct places mentioned in the text, including the planer shed (31), the sawdust pile (33), the pumphouse (34), and a post (34).</p>

"205","Samsons'  Farm","","","","","","","<p>""Samson's"" appears in <em>As I Lay Dying</em> and again in <em>Light in August</em>, both times in the Frenchman's Bend section of Yoknapatawpha, but in two different places.  In the first novel Samson lives next to the river, in what seems to be both a store and a farm.  The porch of the store is where Samson, MacCallum and Quick watch the Bundrens pass by in their wagon before they realize the bridge there is out - probably the same bridge as the 'Samson's Bridge' that is a Location in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  The Bundrens stay the night in Samson's barn, which is why Samson's seems to be a farm too; there is also Samson's house up the hill from the barn.  In <em>Light in August</em> Samson's may still be a store and a barn, but it isn't on the river and it is a lot further from the Bend, further even than Armstid's, which is a good bit northeast of the Bend on the map Faulkner himself drew in 1936.  According to Armstid, ""somebody down at Samson's"" tells Lena Grove that Lucas Burch is working at the planing mill in Jefferson (16), making Samson's the first named Yoknapatawpha location that Lena passes when she arrives in the county from Alabama.  Faulkner undoubtedly would not have been troubled by this kind of discrepancy, but it keeps us on our toes.</p>

"207","Sartoris Plantation in Carolina","","","","","","","<p>Although the Sartorises are one of Yoknapatawpha's most important families, very little is known about the place in 'Carolina' John Sartoris left behind when he moved to Mississippi - not even which 'Carolina' Faulkner is thinking of, though it's most likely South Carolina.  The Carolina Sartorises owned a slave plantation; according to the story told in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> by Aunt Jenny, the Colonel's sister who joins him in Mississippi after the end of the Civil War, the plantation was established by her ""great-great-great-grandfather,"" and burned down by ""drunken Yankee generals"" (50). This is also the story that Elnora, the illegitimate bi-racial daughter of the Colonel, tells her children in ""There Was a Queen.""  The number of ""greats"" Jenny attaches to ""grandfather"" would make him more or less a contemporary of the fathers and mothers of America's 'Founding Fathers.'  Both texts mention the colored window panes that were salvaged from this original family mansion and brought to Mississippi by Jenny in 1869 to grace the family's new plantation home.  These panes are our one clue to the family's wealth in Carolina.  (See also Carolina in the Civil War in this index.)</p>

"209","Jefferson Hardware Store","","","","","","","<p>Given the size of Jefferson, it's likely that the hardware store on the Square is the only hardware store in the town, but like the drugstore its history in the fictions is confusing.  In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> it's ""Watts' hardware store,"" according to Virgil Beard, who covets the air rifles for sale there (108).  Because Jason Compson is working there on Good Friday, 1928, the hardware story is a major location in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, but in that novel it's owned by a man named Earl.  In four other texts that mention it - the short story ""Fool about a Horse"" and Faulkner's last three novels - it's ""Isaac McCaslin's hardware store"" (<em>The Reivers</em>, 14), though (1) when Faulkner revises the story for <em>The Hamlet</em> he decides to call the store ""Cain's,"" a name that doesn't appear in any other text, and (2) in <em>The Mansion</em> Jason Compson ends up in charge of ""the McCaslin Hardware Company"" (355).  McCaslin's role is surprising in itself, since Ike is a carpenter in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, where he is the central character, and usually associated with hunting rather than commerce, but Ike's ownership is also chronologically impossible to reconcile with Watt's and Earl's titles to the store.  Although this kind of inconsistency is not uncommon in the fictions, in this case Faulkner himself seems to have been troubled enough by it to attempt in <em>The Mansion</em> to straighten out the intertextual narrative: there Earl is renamed Earl Triplett, who managed the store in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> for McCaslin, until Triplett ""eliminated Uncle Ike from the business"" and then Jason ""eliminated Triplett"" (355) - an explanation that is likely to leave most readers still more confused, especially considering how frequently and unequivocally in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Jason himself asserts that the store belongs to Earl.  What remains more consistent, however, is the nature of the store.  It seems to cater mainly to customers from the farms in the county (Jason calls them ""rednecks,"" 211).  It stocks merchandise like cultivators, hame strings, butter churns and a new invention called a milk separator, the purchase of which plays a decisive role in the plot of ""Fool about a Horse.""</p>

"212","Parchman Penitentiary","","","","","","","<p>Better known as Parchman Farm, the Mississippi state prison at Parchman is a maximum-security facility that has been in operation since 1901.  It is located in the Delta, the often-flooded part of the state that lies along the Mississippi River; a major flood provides the occasion for the story that Faulkner tells in the ""Old Man"" chapters of <em>Wild Palms</em>, a non-Yoknapatawpha novel that features an unnamed Parchman inmate.  The penitentiary figures in 9 of the Yoknapatawpha fictions.  It is only mentioned in the four texts that refer to Negro characters who are serving time there: ""There Was a Queen"" (Caspey), ""Go Down, Moses"" (the unnamed father of Samuel Worsham Beauchamp), <em>Go Down, Moses</em> (the unnamed moonshiner whom Lucas turns in), and <em>The Reivers</em> (the ""boy back there in Jefferson"" whom Ned mentions, 139-40).  If it were not for the point of law in ""A Point of Law,"" two other black men - Lucas himself and George Wilkins - would have done time there for making whiskey.  The ""penitentiary"" is also mentioned in ""Smoke,"" where Anselm Holland Jr. is the one white man in the fictions who goes to prison for making moonshine (6).  According to Wikipedia, in 1917 90% of the inmates at Parchman were Negroes.  But interestingly, the only fictions that take readers inside the prison to set scenes there feature white prisoners, like the convict in ""Old Man.""  The white character Monk is the first instance of this: much of the short story ""Monk"" takes place at what the narrative refers to as ""the penitentiary"" (49).  In this text the location includes a cell, the warden's house, the mess hall, and the death house.  The character who does the most time in Parchman has a similar name: Mink.  In the Snopes trilogy Mink Snopes spends 38 years in the penitentiary for the murder of Houston, which includes time added on for trying to break out.  Mink is joined there for a few years by Montgomery Ward Snopes, whom Flem arranges to have sent there in order to trick Mink into making that escape attempt.  Mink's experiences in <em>The Mansion</em> provide Faulkner's readers with the most detailed description of Parchman.  The description of it includes the ""single gate guarded day and night by men with shotguns, and inside it the low grim brick buildings with their barred windows"" (54).  <em>The Mansion</em> explains what Lucas means in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> when he thinks about the moonshiner who is now ""plowing and chopping and picking cotton which was not his on the State penal farm at Parchman"" (33): part of the punishment of the prisoners at Parchman, including Mink, is to work a state-owned cotton field.  Parchman also housed female inmates during a portion of its history, but all the characters Faulkner sends there are male.</p>

"213","Alabama","","","","","","","<p>Alabama figures in a dozen different texts.  The real town of Florence, in northwestern Alabama, is mentioned in two of them: ""Hair,"" where it is one of the places where Hawkshaw works as a barber, and <em>The Reivers</em>, where it is the ultimate destination of the train that the 'reivers' take from Memphis to Parsham.  Alabama's largest city, Birmingham, is where Popeye is arrested for a murder he didn't commit: this is mentioned in both <em>Sanctuary</em> and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.  Popeye spends time in two other places in the state: Mobile, on the Gulf of Mexico, and the unnamed Alabama town where (in <em>Sanctuary</em>) he is tried and executed (in <em>Requiem</em> he is hanged as well as arrested in Birmingham).  Faulkner calls the city where Elly's aunt lives in ""Elly"" 'Mills City'; this is probably a fictional name for Birmingham, which was founded just after the Civil War to be an industrial center - like the city in England after which it was named.  The other major Alabama location in ""Elly"" is a sharp curve on the road that leads into and out of Mills City.  Emily Grierson, in ""A Rose for Emily,"" has ""two female cousins"" who live somewhere in the state.  The border between Mississippi and Alabama is not far from the fictional site of Yoknapatawpha, and in <em>The Unvanquished</em> stories, set during the Civil War, Granny, Bayard and Ringo travel there to recover the Sartoris silver from the Yankee army, which has moved eastward after conquering Mississippi.  On the way they stay overnight at Hawkhurst, the Alabama plantation that belongs to Granny's sister's family.  The several Alabama locations in ""Raid,"" the <em>Unvanquished</em> story that describes their journey, have their own entries in our database (on the road, Hawkhurst, Union camp) but this entry includes the passage in the later story, ""The Unvanquished,"" where Bayard recalls the trip.  And the <em>Unvanquished</em> story ""Vendee"" features one other Alabama location, the farm where Bayard, Ringo and Buddy McCaslin find the injured woman and boy during their pursuit of the outlaw who killed Granny.  Although these stories show the effects of the Civil War, Faulkner makes only indirect references to any of the combat that took place in the state.  It is just after the war ends that the daughter of the jailer in Jefferson, named Cecelia Farmer in <em>Requiem</em>, travels with her new husband, a Confederate lieutenant from Alabama, to his ""small hill farm"" (185) about ""a hundred miles"" from Jefferson (203); the narrative never takes us there, but does mention the ""dozen"" boys she gives birth to - an increase in the population of Alabama that as far as I can recall is not equaled by any of the families who come to or remain in Faulkner's Mississippi.</p>

"214","Sartoris Plantation Garden","","","","","","","<p>The garden at the Sartoris plantation is associated with the ladies in the family.  The ""queen"" of the story ""There Was a Queen"" is Colonel Sartoris' sister, Jenny Du Pre, who brought flower ""cuttings"" with her when she came to Sartoris from Carolina sixty years earlier and planted them in Mississippi, where they or more probably their descendants continue to bloom (728).  She and the old family servant Simon Strothers, and Simon's grandson Isom, are described working together in the garden - though under Jenny's strict supervision - in several passages in Faulkner's first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  Over a decade older in ""There Was a Queen,"" and confined to a wheelchair, she can only look at the garden from her upstairs window, which is how she spends most of the story and where she dies at the end.  The other woman associated with the gardens at Sartoris is Rosa Millard, ""My Grandmother Millard"" in the title of a story narrated by Bayard Sartoris.  This story, like the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories earlier, focuses on how Granny runs the plantation while her son-in-law Colonel John is away fighting in the Civil War.  It mentions the ""flower beds"" in front of the house (674), but the garden behind the house where Lucius works is probably a kitchen garden, growing herbs and vegetables (669).

"215","Washington D.C.","","","","","","","<p>The only Faulkner story that uses Washington, D.C., as a setting is ""Lo!"" - a comic tale about a visit paid by Indians to the nation's capital.  The Indians are Chickasaws, but not the Chickasaws who appear in the Yoknapatawpha fictions, and so ""Lo!"" is not included in Digital Yoknapatawpha.  Over a dozen of the texts we do include, however, do mention the nation's capital, almost always as a synecdoche for the Federal government.  As the ""Appendix"" that he wrote for <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, which begins with the Chickasaw chief Ikkemotubbe and President Jackson ""in his gold tepee in Wassi Town"" (326), notes, the origin of Jefferson was a federal Indian agency; that part of the Yoknapatawpha story is developed at some length in ""A Name for the City"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.  In those texts the white settlers who displace the Indians have mixed feelings about the U.S. government: it is a source of largesse but also of intrusive ""Acts of Congress"" (212, 19).  During the Civil War, of course, the Confederates saw the city as the capital of an enemy country; Buck McCaslin is thinking of it that way when he boasts that Colonel Sartoris and his regiment from Yoknapatawpha got ""within spitting distance"" of Washington (""Retreat,"" 21; <em>The Unvanquished</em>, 52).  During Reconstruction Faulkner's white Southerners still see the federal government as an antagonist: when Sartoris shoots the agents who come to Yoknapatawpha ""with a patent from Washington to organize"" the emancipated slaves into voters, he's seen as defending the county from an enemy invader (66).  And through the fictions set in the 20th century the attitude toward 'Washington' remains largely hostile, especially when the 'acts of Congress' include the many agricultural regulations and Depression-era agencies of the Roosevelt administration.  Federal agents who try to enforce the rules about the production of alcohol products have been known to disappear in the hills of Yoknapatawpha, and Jason Compson's rage against the government for ""spending fifty thousand dollars a day keeping an army in Nicarauga or some place"" (<em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, 234) is widely, though not often this deeply, shared. Although Faulkner never directly addresses the role of 'Washington' in the Civil Rights era in his fictions, Gavin Stevens' impatience with the ""federal government"" against which the white South has to defend itself and its ""homogeneity"" in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> (150-53) has a kinship with John Sartoris' actions during and after the Civil War.  On the other hand, two other characters in the fictions work for the federal government in 'Washington': Gowan Stevens' father in the State Department (<em>The Town</em>), and the F.B.I. agent in ""There Was a Queen.""  Mr. Stevens remains offstage, but when the agent appears at the dining room table in Yoknapatawpha, Colonel Sartoris' sister refuses to eat with him.</p>

There are vines on many of the saplings and trees, and a creek runs through them.  It seems likely that the spring ""flowing from the roots of a beech"" where Old Bayard sought refuge when he was a child was also in these woods (90).</p>

"218","Mottstown|Mottson","","","","","","","<p>As is fairly normal in Faulkner's imaginary world, the first town you would reach traveling south from Jefferson is sometimes called ""Mottson"" and sometimes ""Mottstown.""  Like Jefferson, it is a county seat, though in ""Hand upon the Waters"" the name of the county is Okatoba, while in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> it's Mott. On Faulkner's 1936 map its location is indicated by an arrow pointing south of Jefferson and the notation ""To Mottstown, where Jason Compson lost his niece's trail, and where Anse Bundren and his boys had to go in order to reach Jefferson.""  Although it definitely is in a separate county, we include it on our main map because so many events in the Yoknapatawpha fictions take place there. Jason's misadventure occurs in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, and the Bundrens' brief visit in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>; curiously, both mention the drugstore, where Jason can't get aspirin (because the store is closed on Easter morning) and Dewey Dell can't get anything to abort her pregnancy (because, the indignant pharmacist says, he's ""been a church-member for fifty-six years,"" 202).  Although that map annotation leaves Dewey Dell out, she and the druggist are at the center of the novel's Mottson episode.  Mottstown is the central location in one story, ""That Will Be Fine,"" which takes place during a Jefferson family's Christmastime visit to their grandparents and mentions the town ""pool hall"" (279), the livery ""stable"" (282), and the office of the local Compress Association office in addition to a number of middle-class residences.  Probably the most dramatic event in the history of Mottstown is the capture of Joe Christmas there in <em>Light in August</em>, which draws attention to the strange lives the Hineses - who by one of the more spectacular coincidences in the fictions turn out to be Joe's grandparents - have lived in the town after moving to Mottstown twenty-five years earlier.  Included in that account are the town's courthouse, barbershop, sheriff's office, Negro district and the ""little cafe down by the depot"" (358).  A unit of Union troops camps there in ""The Unvanquished"" as both a story and a novel.  Tyler Ballenbaugh, a resident of Frenchman's Bend, purchases life insurance there for Lonnie Grinnup in ""Hand upon the Waters.""  And in <em>Intruder</em> Chick Mallison travels there to play football and score a touchdown for Jefferson High.  Interestingly, in ""The Unvanquished"" Granny Millard notes that ""Oxford and Mottstown are only a few miles"" apart (78).  This is one of the few cues in the fiction to the relative positions of the real Oxford where Faulkner lived and the fictional Jefferson where his imagination spent so much time, but given Faulkner's determination in other fictions to obfuscate Oxford's location in relation to Jefferson's, we shouldn't make too much of Granny's geography.  (6 other Locations in Mottstown have their own entries in this index: Georgie's Grandpa's Home, Mandy's Cabin, Mottson Filling Station, Mottstown|Mottson Railroad Station, Mrs. Jordon's House, and Neighbor's House in Mottstown.)</p>

Louisa Hawk is the sister of Rosa Millard, John Sartoris' mother-in-law.  When Rosa and Bayard and Ringo visit the plantation in ""Raid,"" it too has been burned down by Yankee troops, probably shortly after the battle in nearby Shiloh in which Dennison Hawk, the owner of the plantation, was killed.  ""There was no house there"" - all that remains of the Hawk mansion are piles of ashes and ""four chimneys standing gaunt and blackened in the sun like the chimneys at home"" (86).  The remaining members of the white family - Louisa and her children Drusilla and Denny - are living in the slave cabin that was previously occupied by Jingus.  Jingus is still there, presumably sleeping in ""Missy Lena's cabin"" (99), but most if not all of the other slaves seem to have left to follow the Union army.  The grounds also hold a family graveyard and border on a railroad track.  When Bayard last visited Hawkhurst several years earlier, the newly constructed track was in pristine condition. Now, the tracks have been dismantled and wrapped around trees by the Union troops.  The location is also mentioned in ""The Unvanquished"" (re-titled ""Riposte in Tertio"" as a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>) and ""Skirmish at Sartoris.""</p>

This is the ""bottom"" between Mottstown and the Sartoris plantation where Ab Snopes hides the mules that Miss Rosa has stolen from the Union Army in ""The Unvanquished"" and <em>The Unvanquished</em>.  There is a real Hickahala Creek in Mississippi, halfway between Oxford and Memphis. If we were sure Faulkner had this real creek in mind, this reference would be one of the strongest clues he provides to the relative positions of the real Oxford and his imaginary Jefferson - that is, Jefferson would also be between Oxford and Memphis, and about 20 miles north of Hickahala Creek  But we cannot be sure about this.</p>

"224","Episcopal Church in the County","","","","","","","<p>The church where the Sutpen family worships in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> is identified on Faulkner's 1936 map only as ""Church (which Sutpen rode fast to)"" ([314]).  This novel does not mention the church's denominational affiliation, but if the Sutpens - the owners of the largest and wealthiest planation in Yoknapatawpha - attend it, it's almost certainly Episcopalian.  And it's just as likely that this is the same location as the Episcopal Church north of Jefferson that the Sartorises attend in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, written almost simultaneously with <em>Absalom!</em>   In that text Bayard describes the church's location relative to the mule pen at Sartoris: ""not toward the cabin but across the pasture toward the road"" (146), a direction which leads to the spot where Faulkner puts Sutpen's church on that map.  And both novels mention ""the hitching grove"" behind the church that ""would be full of carriages from the other plantations"" (<em>Absalom!</em>, 17; <em>Unvanquished</em>, 135).  In Sutpen's case there is no description of the interior of the church, but the details provided in <em>The Unvanquished</em> indicate the architectural peculiarity of plantation Christianity, which brought masters and slaves together on Sundays in a strictly segregated space: while the Sartoris family has a pew in the front of the altar, enslaved people sat above them, in a gallery along the walls that could hold 200 Negroes.  Bayard contrasts the current congregation - ""the old men and the women and the children and the maybe a dozen niggers that didn't have any white people now"" (134) - with his memory of services before the war: ""Doctor Worsham in his stole beneath the altar, and for each white person in the auditorium there would be ten niggers in the gallery"" (135).  It's also possible that this may be one of the ""three churches"" that, according to <em>Absalom!</em>, are already in Jefferson in 1833 (24).</p>

But now the Negroes are gone to ""ghettos"" in the North and elsewhere, and ""the planter"" who owns the property or ""the planter's not-yet drafted son"" works the land on a tractor (193).

According to <em>The Reivers</em>, a few years before 1905 the advent of the automobile led the oil company to add  ""a special tank of gasoline, with a pump,"" to its oil tanks ""on the side track at the [train] depot"" (48).  This is the first 'gas station' in Yoknapatawpha.  About four decades later, according to <em>The Town</em>, a ""tremendous explosion, the loudest sound at one time that Jefferson ever heard"" occurs at this location (114).  The town ""all knew it couldn't be anything else but that German bomb come at last,"" but it is in fact one of the tanks blowing up, killing the night watchman Eck Snopes.</p>

"231","Carolina","","","","","","","<p>Unlike Virginia and West Virginia, North and South Carolina have been two different states since the colonial times, but Faulkner almost always elides the distinction, referring frequently to ""Carolina"" (and once to ""the Carolinas"") to define where so many of the inhabitants of Yoknapatawpha originally came from.  Among the families with this heritage are lower class farmers in places like Frenchman's Bend with names like ""Gowrie and Frazier and Muir,"" who migrated ""from Culloden [in Scotland] to Carolina, then from Carolina to Yoknapatawpha"" (<em>The Town</em>, 332). But the term is most often applied to the upper class group that could be called the 'first families of Yoknapatawpha,' large plantation owners like the Sartorises and McCaslins, and with the implication that hailing from ""Carolina"" confers a kind of aristocratic pedigree.  What is said about Sutpen in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> establishes this by negation.  Sutpen owns the largest Yoknapatawpha plantation, but his many rough edges make it clear that he is ""no younger son sent out from some old quiet country like Virginia or Carolina"" (11).  In this context it seems likely that when Faulkner or one of his characters refers to ""Carolina,"" they mean 'South Carolina'; <em>Absalom!</em> for instance treats Charleston, South Carolina, as a more distinguished address than even Richmond, Virginia (100, 188).  This motif acquires a comic and perhaps satiric tone in ""A Name for the City"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, where the young settlement in Jefferson misplaces a large padlock that, like so many of its inhabitants, originated in ""Carolina"" (200, 6).  If Jefferson's name comes from Virginia, that's only because of the role played in its history by this 'Carolina' lock.

At the other end of Faulkner's career, in <em>The Town</em>, the town's department store is mentioned again; it has large plate-glass windows displaying merchandise, is big enough that it has a ""luggage department"" (210), and is also given a name - ""Wildermark's"" (208).  Since neither a toy store nor a clothing store is ever specifically mentioned in the Yoknapatawpha fictions, we assume that this department store is also where Emily buys ""a complete outfit of men's clothing, including a nightshirt"" (127), Mrs. Gant buys her daughter Zilphia a ""miniature cook stove""  (372), and the salesman from Memphis in ""Gold Is Not Always"" buys the new ""khaki pants . . . still showing the creases where they had been folded on the store's shelf"" (233).</p>

After he and 'Brown' depart, Bryon Bunch moves Lena Grove into the cabin, and it is the place where her child is born.  The day after that happens, Reverend Hightower has a vision of the place as it looked when the slaves were there: ""the rich fecund black life of the quarters, the mellow shouts, the presence of fecund women, the prolific naked children in the dust before the doors"" (407).  Former slave cabins have appeared before in Faulkner's fiction (often occupied by descendants of the slaves who once lived in them), but this is the first time one of his texts depicts, from any perspective, the lives of the enslaved people who lived in those cabins.</p>

"241","Bank of Jefferson","","","","","","","<p>There are at least two different banks in Jefferson.  This one - ""the Bank of Jefferson,"" sometimes called ""the old bank"" - does not figure as prominently in the fictions as the bank founded by Bayard Sartoris in the 1890s (see the entry in this index for Sartoris Bank|Merchants' and Farmers' Bank).  We don't know anything about the man or men who originally opened the Bank of Jefferson sometime before the Civil War, but in 1905 it is run by Lucius Priest I (<em>The Reivers</em>, 26).  It is easy to tell the two banks apart in the last two volumes of the Snopes trilogy, where control of the Sartoris bank is a major plot element; as part of his campaign to become that bank's president, Flem Snopes moves his money back and forth between the two banks.  Elsewhere identifying this bank requires an act of interpretation.  In ""Elly,"" the title character's fiance Philip is a cashier in ""the bank""; we presume it's this older one  (213).  We make the same assumption about where Lucas Beauchamp keeps his money.  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> Ike McCaslin takes Lucas on Lucas' 21st birthday to deposit the thousand dollars the McCaslin family gives him as a legacy from the white slave-owner who was Lucas' grandfather.  The day the two cousins - one white; one bi-racial, which is 'black' in the eyes of white Yoknapatawpha - came into the bank to deposit all that money in the Negro's account was part of ""the minor annals of the town"" (105), but the bank is not named.

"255","Oklahoma","","","","","","","<p>The Oklahoma territory to the west of the Mississippi River was the land to which many tribes - including the Chickasaws and Choctaws who once lived in Yoknapatawpha - were sent by the American government during the 'Indian removals' of the first half of the 19th century.  Chick Mallison's chronology is faulty when he says in <em>The Town</em> that ""the last Chickasaw departed for Oklahoma in 1820"" (11), but they were all gone before 1840.  <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> shows the last of the Yoknapatawpha Chickasaws leaving for the ""Indian territory"" (170); one of the first three white settlers in Yoknapatawpha, the son of Doctor Habersham, goes with them.  He married a Chickasaw and ""in the thirties [i.e. the 1830s] emigrates to Oklahoma with his wife's dispossessed people"" (7).  The treaty they signed promised Oklahoma to the Indians for as long as the grass grew, but in the 1889 that promise was violated by the rush of white settlers for the land.  Faulkner never mentions the 'Land Rush,' but does refer several times to a second betrayal of the treaty.  In the ""Appendix"" to <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> that he wrote in the mid-1940s he writes, wryly, that the U.S. signed the treaty before it knew ""about the oil"" (325); the first gusher erupted in Oklahoma in 1896, setting off a second rush into the territory.   In <em>Light in August</em> Oklahoma is the site of one of Joe Christmas's stopovers during his ""fifteen years"" of travels, and probably where at least some of the ""oil towns"" he worked in were located (224).

"256","Missouri","","","","","","","<p>Missouri was admitted to the U.S. as a slave state in 1831, but during the Civil War did not secede from the Union to join the Confederacy.  Perhaps that explains the apparent contradiction in <em>The Unvanquished</em>.  In the chapter ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" Bayard refers to ""the two Burdens from Missouri"" who are in Jefferson to help the newly emancipated slaves vote in a local election (199).  As <em>Light in August</em> confirms, the Burdens did live in Missouri before coming to Yoknapatawpha, but in the <em>Unvanquished</em> chapter ""An Odor of Verbena"" Drusilla calls the Burdens ""northerners"" (223).  In <em>Light in August</em> the older Burden was born in New England, but it's not clear that Drusilla could have known that.  The three slave states that did not secede - including Maryland and Kentucky - were usually referred to as 'border' states, between 'North' and 'South.'  But perhaps in Drusilla's mind, that fact that Missouri didn't join the Confederate States made it a <em>northern</em> state.  Perhaps the most interesting reference to Missouri in the fictions occurs in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, which mentions Mark Twain and ""the Missouri dream"" as comparable to ""the Yoknapatawpha dream too"" (205): both privilege the ideas of freedom and the frontier.  St. Louis, Missouri, is used or referred to in 11 Yoknapatawpha fictions, and has its own entry in this index.  As does Kansas City, which despite its name is also a city in Missouri.</p>

In <em>The Town</em> the ""Jicarilla Apache squaw"" with whom Byron Snopes has four children is from Mexico (379).  In the context of Faulkner's world, their relationship is transgressive, and from any point of view their children are uncontrollable.  ""Mexico"" has similar connotations of lawlessness elsewhere in <em>The Town</em>: Chick Mallison says Byron Snopes ""escaped to Mexico"" after robbing Colonel Sartoris' Bank (113) and later imagines Flem might do the same thing.  Similarly, in <em>The Mansion</em> it is suspected that Flem might be planning to ship another cousin there (69).  And in ""Knight's Gambit,"" the ""spinster aunts"" of Yoknapatawpha speculate Harriss might have left his wife and taken off for Mexico (157).  Two other texts - ""Lion"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> - use it a point of reference, comparing the ""Aztec"" chiefs to the lordly dog Lion and contrasting the kind of ambitions someone like ""Maximian of Mexico"" had with the dreams that are possible in Missouri and Mississippi (249).</p>

"258","Chicago, Illinois","","","","","","","<p>Chicago, Illinois, is mentioned in 8 texts, and used in this project as a Location in 9.  That needs explaining.  Our practice is to include a Location for the place from which every first-person narrator tells a story.  The narrator of ""Ad Astra"" only gives ambiguous clues about where he lives.  He identifies himself as an ""American"" in the opening sentences (407).  Based on what he says about Bland - ""He was a Southerner, too, like Sartoris"" (408) - he's not from the South.  That doesn't tell us, however, where he is from, nor does the story give any clue about where he is living in the present.  ""Chicago"" here is equivalent to 'somewhere probably in the U.S.'  It's Faulkner himself who makes ""Chicago"" a location in the other 7 texts.  Some of his references are general.  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> it's mentioned along with ""Kansas City and Boston and Philadelphia"" as an epitome of municipal political corruption (192).  In <em>The Town</em> Chick Mallison uses ""Chicago"" as a way to measure a long distance from Yoknapatawpha, as in ""as far away away as Chicago"" (14).  In a sense that's how Faulkner's using it at the end of <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, when Bayard Sartoris, who as a 'Sartoris' should be looking after his plantation and his family in Yoknapatawpha, is instead getting drunk in a very 'northern,' urban, 'modern' Chicago nightclub.  In his story it's a place of exile.  At the same time Bayard ends up there, many other Southerners from places like rural Yoknapatawpha migrated to Chicago.  They were black.  The 'Great Migration' of the early 20th century saw millions of African Americans leave the South for northern cities.  Among them are Samuel Worsham Beauchamp, in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, who was born on the McCaslin plantation but dies in Illinois after ""killing a cop"" in Chicago, where according to his own account his employment was ""getting rich too fast"" (256, 352).  <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> refers to this migration when it notes that the ""ghettoes"" of Chicago are one of the places (along with those of ""New York and Detroit and Los Angeles"") to which the Negro tenant farmers and ""furnish-hands"" who worked in Yoknapatawpha's fields have moved by the 1930s (193).  Joe Christmas' wanderings in <em>Light in August</em> may be Faulkner's earliest reference to this phenomenon, though the connection is not made explicit; Chicago is one of the places, along with Detroit, where ""he lives with negroes, shunning white people"" (225).  For the blacks who moved there, working in factories in the industrial North was preferable to tenantry on Southern farms, though the closest Faulkner's fiction gets to a northern factory is his somewhat antisemitic reference in the ""Appendix"" to the ""Jew owners of Chicago and New York sweatshops"" where the ""cheap"" clothes that southern blacks like TP wear are ""manufactured"" (343).  Two suburbs of Chicago appear in two very different contexts.  <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> compares the reputation of Yoknapatawpha's Beat Four to the notoriety that Cicero - a suburb eight miles outside Chicago - acquired ""in the middle [nineteen] twenties"" (35) as the base from which Al Capone operated his crime syndicate.  <em>Requiem</em> mentions ""Northwestern,"" the private university located in Evanston twenty miles from downtown Chicago (205).</p>

"259","Michigan","","","","","","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> the Drake family pretends that Temple is staying with her aunt in Michigan to cover up the fact that she has disappeared. The first character actually to spend time in Michigan is Joe Christmas, in <em>Light in August</em>.  Joe travels through a good bit of the U.S. during his experiences on ""the street which was to run for fifteen years"" (223).  His itinerary seems essentially random, but it's possible that he goes to Detroit, where he ""lived with negroes, shunning white people"" (225), because that city, like Chicago where Joe also lives ""with negroes,"" was one of the principal places to which the millions of Negroes who left the South during the first third of the 20th century went.  This demographic event is called the Great Migration, and Faulkner certainly has it in mind when (in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>) he relocates Lucas Beauchamp's daughter and her husband to Detroit.  In the later <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> he makes the connection explicit, referring to the ""ghettoes"" of Detroit as one of the urban spaces (along with ""New York and Chicago and Los Angeles"") to which the Negro tenant farmers and ""furnish-hands"" who worked in Yoknapatawpha's fields have moved by the 1930s (193). The city of Detroit was a major manufacturing center during most of the 20th century, making it a magnet for Americans black and white in search of economic opportunity.  The fictions' one other reference to Michigan is also to a manufacturing city: in ""Knight's Gambit"" the fences that Harriss builds to define the boundaries of his Yoknapatawpha estate are ""handicrafted in Grand Rapids factories"" (241). This Michigan city was famous during most of the 20th century for producing quality wood furniture.</p>

"263","California","","","","","","","<p>As the westernmost place on the continent with the hills that are full of gold, ""California"" has long been a symbolic destination for Americans.  In the fictions Faulkner sometimes pairs it with ""Texas"" as a place for running away from one's past (<em>The Town</em>, 346), though when Temple Drake Stevens looks for that kind of escape on a California beach that is ""far from Jefferson"" (<em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, 61) her own son reminds her why she has to go back.  For Willy Christian, who wants to escape Jefferson's present rather than his past, California is mythic.  Twice he calls it ""California!""- using the word and the exclamation point as a kind of incantation (""Uncle Willy,"" 242). Not surprisingly he never gets there.  More material are the aspirations of the Negro tenant farmers and ""furnish-hands"" who in the 1930s exchange Yoknapatawpha's cotton fields for the ""ghettoes"" of Los Angeles as well as in northern cities like ""New York and Detroit and Chicago"" (<em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, 193).  In his later fiction Faulkner locates a new kind of racial diversity in California.  When Chick Mallison mentions the one ""Chinaman"" who lives in Jefferson in <em>The Town</em>, he claims that ""we all knew about San Francisco's Chinatown,"" ""half the world or anyway half the continent"" away (321) - ""we"" of course are the white townspeople, and he doesn't explain what they ""knew.""  California is associated with racial injustice as well.  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> he uses another piece of Jefferson - the captured German ""tank gun"" that stands near the Confederate statue in the Square as a memorial to the local veterans of World War II - to mention the internment camps to which the Japanese-Americans living on the west coast were removed as a possible threat to the war effort against Japan. The ""regiment of Japanese"" - i.e. Japanese-American soldiers - who captured the tank have parents confined to ""a California detention camp for enemy aliens"" (194); that was the official language, though almost two-thirds of the 110,000-120,000 people interned were American citizens and there was no effort to prove they were ""enemies."" Two of the ten camps on the U.S. mainland were in California, and about a quarter of the people who were interned were in these two camps.  Except for that unnamed Chinese man, all the Asian-Americans in the fictions are located in California.  Gavin Stevens reproduces that pattern when he refers, imaginatively, to various veterans of World War I around the U.S. and equates the experience of ""John Doe of Jefferson, Mississippi,"" with that of ""Harry Wong of San Francisco"" (""Knight's Gambit,"" 243).  Two other wars define the role California plays in two other texts.  In <em>Sanctuary</em> Ruby Lamar waits for Lee Goodwin, who is ""a soldier in the Philippines (59), by working in a restaurant in San Francisco.  Two wars later, Pete Grier sends his family presents from a San Francisco drugstore before shipping out for the Pacific in ""Shall Not Perish"" (105).

"265","Kentucky","","","","","","","<p>Although Kentucky did not secede from the Union during the Civil War, it was a slave-holding state, and the Ohio River separating Kentucky from Ohio was often employed like the Mason-Dixon Line, as a way to distinguish 'the South' from 'the North.'  Presumably that is the context for Jason's sarcastic and racist remark in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> when he echoes what he assumes Northerners say about Negroes: ""Get them ahead, what I say. Get them so far ahead you cant find one south of Louisville with a blood hound"" (231).  Louisville is a Kentucky city on the Ohio River.  Kentucky comes up much more frequently in Quentin's section of that novel, because it is the place where Gerald Bland - Quentin's southern antithesis, the Fortinbras to his Hamlet - and his mother are from; from what we learn, the Blands also live on an old plantation, but presumably a more prosperous one than the Compson place.  Three of Quentin and Jason's ancestors briefly live in Kentucky, in a frontier town called ""Harrodsburg"" in the ""Appendix"" that Faulkner wrote for the novel.  ""Harrodsburg"" is the modern name for Harrodstown, a frontier community in north central Kentucky originally settled by James Harrod in 1774; it is not far from the settlement that ""a neighbor named Boon or Boone"" had ""already established"" (326); Daniel Boone founded Fort Boonesborough as one of the first white settlements west of the Appalachians in 1775, two decades before Kentucky became a state and a generation or two before Jason Lycurgus Compson, Quentin's great-great-grandfather, relocated from Kentucky to the newer frontier in northeastern Mississippi.  By the middle of the 19th century Kentucky was famous for the quality of its race horses, which is why in ""Fool about a Horse"" Pap - a failed horse-trader - tries to claim that his new horse ""come from Kentucky"" too (122).</p>

"268","Indiana","","","","","","","<p>3 different places in Indiana are mentioned in 4 different texts - but always in connection with 2 different illegitimate children.  It's tempting to see a pattern here, perhaps revealing something about the associative way the human imagination works.  In any case, the first child is the one Caddy Compson gives birth to in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>.  Because she is pregnant, she allows her mother to take her to French Lick, Indiana (with its own entry in this index).  At French Lick Caddy meets ""an extremely eligible young Indianian"" (""Appendix Compson,"" 332) named Herbert Head, whom she marries without telling him about her pregnancy.  In the novel the invitation to their wedding says they will be living in South Bend, where Head is from, after their honeymoon; so they are presumably in Indiana when the child is born and he disowns both her and his wife.  The second child is born out of wedlock in ""Delta Autumn"" and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.  The father is Don Boyd in the first text, and Roth Edmonds in the second.  In neither text is the child's mother named - or married - but until shortly before she had the affair she ""lived in Indianapolis,"" the largest city in Indiana, with her father (278, 343).</p>

Although <em>Light in August</em> doesn't use the term, for most of the time during Nathaniel Burden's travels in Kansas between 1850 and 1866, the territory was known as 'Bleeding Kansas.'  During the decade preceding statehood in 1861, Kansas was the scene of violent fighting between pro- and anti-slavery forces.  In <em>The Hamlet</em>, published seven years later, Jack Houston lives in Kansas for a while in the 1880s, working in the state's iconic wheat fields.

"273","Canada","","","","","","","<p>Because his height made him ineligible to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps, during World War I Faulkner enlisted in the Canadian Royal Air Force to train as an aviator.  His training had not ended when the War did, so he never got to serve in combat.  But both Warren and Jock in ""Death Drag"" get into the war after their pilot's training ""in Canada"" (194), and so does [Bayard] Sartoris in ""All the Dead Pilots.""  These texts don't say where in Canada they trained, but the military flight school Faulkner attended was in Toronto.  One important character in the fictions is a Canadian: Quentin Compson's Harvard roommate Shreve, who appears in both <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>  In the second novel especially, Faulkner uses Shreve's birthplace as a way to provide an outsider's perspective on the intensely American and even more intensely Southern story he and Quentin explore, and it seems worth mentioning that, in the Genealogy at the end of <em>Absalom!</em>, Shreve is the only character who is unambiguously still alive.  His training was medical.  According to that Genealogy, he also served in France in World War I - as a captain in the ""Royal Army Medical Corps""; he is ""Now a practicing surgeon, Edmonton, Alberta"" (309).  According to the novel itself, he was born in Alberta.  Apparently he can go home again.  (See also the entry for Lake Louise in this index.)</p>

"276","Jefferson Newspaper Office|Printing Shop","","","","","","","<p>The ""office of the county weekly newspaper"" appears in 3 different texts (259, 355).

In ""Go Down, Moses"" it's where Gavin Stevens goes for information about the Negro whom Mollie Beauchamp has asked him to find.  Though the office itself isn't described in any of the texts, the fact that it is across the Square from Gavin's office is mentioned.  And ironically, in all these cases, nothing ever ends up getting into the local newspaper.  We include in this Location the place where Jason goes in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> hoping to find blank checks that he can substitute for the actual checks Caddy sends Mrs. Compson; he calls it ""the printing shop"" (216), but based on ""Death Drag"" it seems possible that it might also have been the newspaper office, especially considering the size of Jefferson: in small American towns the local newspaper often served as the local printer.</p>

They seem to serve different classes of (white) people - the laws of Jim Crow apply to both.  In ""Death Drag"" Captain Warren and Jock eat in Vernon's ""cafe"" (194).  Warren calls it a ""restaurant"" (194), and as a 'captain' would be expected to eat in a higher class place.  But Jock abruptly ducks into the ""cafe,"" and we don't learn enough during the scene that takes place there to say with any certainty what kind of place it is.

A ""Fair Association"" would organize events like the barnstorming show Jack and the others want to put on. But that doesn't exactly explain how an office could also be a store.

"283","Road between Jefferson and Mottstown","","","","","","","<p>The main north-south road through Jefferson is frequently traveled in the fictions, though most of the traffic is on the section north of town. Travel on the other portion is mainly connected with getting to and from Mottstown, the seat of the adjacent county to the south.  In <em>As I Lay Dying</em> the Bundrens travel up this road and enter Jefferson from the south as the last leg of their journey to the cemetery to bury Addie; on the outskirts of town they see a car for the first time on the trip, and on the southern edge of town they see ""massed telephone lines"" and ""negro cabins"" (229).  The most memorable trip down this road is probably the one that Jason Compson takes in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> on Easter Sunday, his headache pounding from the smell of gasoline, furiously chasing the money that he believes can save him while passing churches ""from time to time"" (306).  But the stretch of this road closest to Mottstown also is the site of two very different kinds of events.  In <em>Light in August</em> it is the last stage of Joe Christmas' long journey.  He can't know that Mottstown is where the grandfather who abandoned him as an infant on the steps of the orphanage in Memphis now lives, he doesn't even seem to want to reach Mottstown, but he sees the ""broad gravelled road"" on which he is getting a ride into Mottstown in the shape of the ""circle"" in which he's lived his whole life (338, 339).  The spot where Joe reaches the road can't be far from the place where Granny and Bayard are almost captured by the Union soldiers from whom they've just stolen a set of mules in <em>The Unvanquished</em> -  this happens about four years after Joe's ride, measured by the dates of Faulkner's career, and over half a century earlier in the chronological record of Yoknapatawpha.  The road is also taken to Mottstown by the family of the narrator in ""That Will Be Fine,"" and to Jefferson by the barnstorming pilots and daredevils in ""Death Drag.""  We assume the ""straight stretch of road about two miles from town"" where Manfred de Spain and Lucius Hogganbeck race cars on Sunday afternoons in <em>The Town</em> is also somewhere along this road (61).  How conscious Faulkner is about using the roads of Yoknapatawpha as one way to measure the larger progress of the South is a question I can't answer, but it may be worth noting that when Jason rushes down the road in 1928, it's completely unpaved; Jason is sure is it's going to rain, turning the road to ""mud"" in which his car will get stuck (305), while just a few years later, when Joe is driven down it in a mule-drawn wagon, it's ""graveled,"" which leads the narrator of that text to call it a ""highway"" (338).  Paving does play a significant role elsewhere in the fictions: in ""A Rose for Emily"" Homer comes to Jefferson to pave the sidewalks in town, and other roads are often characterized by how well graded or graveled or, eventually, paved they are.  (Needless to say, 'getting stuck' also plays a big role in Faulkner's fiction, as Joe's viscious circle indicates.)</p>

"288","University of Mississippi, Oxford","","","","","","","<p>The University of Mississippi in Oxford opened in 1844, fifteen years before Henry Sutpen and Charles Bon meet there in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>  According to Mr. Compson in that novel, in 1859 it is ""a small new college in the Mississippi hinterland"" (58).  The ""grove at the University"" where Mr. Compson speculates Henry first sees Bon is a real part of the campus (76).  The two young men both attend the Law School, which opened in 1854.  A generation later Bayard Sartoris is a law student there in <em>The Unvanquished</em>.  None of these young men graduate.  A generation or two after that, Gavin Stevens does get his law degree from this same ""State University"" (<em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, 3), and the ""college professor from the neighboring State University"" who visits Gavin in <em>Light in August</em> almost certainly teaches there (444).  The ""archaeologists"" in ""An Error in Chemistry"" who try to explore the ""Indian and even aboriginal relics"" that are preserved in the clay-pit on Pritchel's land are ""from the State University"" too (119).   Although Faulkner attended classes there himself, briefly, and worked in the University Post Office, also briefly, in general he keeps his imaginative distance from the campus - just as in the fictions he keeps at least forty miles between the real Oxford and the fictional Jefferson.  In fact, the biggest difference between Oxford and Jefferson is that when Faulkner created his town he left the college out of it.  Women began attending the University in the 1880s. Temple Drake is an undergraduate there in <em>Sanctuary</em>, and the plot of that novel includes a trip from Jefferson to Oxford to try to find her.  That quest takes Horace Benbow onto the campus, and even into the Post Office: three of the eight Locations on the inset map of Oxford for that novel are specific university sites, which have their own entries in this index.  Temple herself refers to ""the University"" (100) and the railroad station ""at the University"" (164) when she recalls the incidents of <em>Sanctuary</em> in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.</p>

"289","Harvard University","","","","","","","<p>Two of Faulkner's most prominent characters are among the four who attend Harvard, the oldest and among the most prestigious American colleges: Quentin Compson and Gavin Stevens. Quentin spends most of his section in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> wandering in and around Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Harvard is located, but the section begins and ends in his dorm room somewhere on the campus.  That space is actually the setting for about half of <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> as he and his roommate Shreve try to reconstruct the story of Thomas Sutpen.  In both novels Quentin is too preoccupied with his own and the Southern past to interact much as a student with college life, but the academic setting is characterized in <em>Absalom!</em> in several Faulknernian phrases: ""this strange room, across this strange iron New England snow"" (141); a ""warm and rosy orifice above the iron quad"" (176); ""this dreamy and heatless alcove of what we call the best of thought"" (208), an environment ""dedicated to the best of ratiocination"" (225). Readers have to decide for themselves how much irony might lurk in those assertions, but as Mr. Compson reminds Quentin in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>: ""for you to go to harvard has been your mothers dream since you were born"" (178). Quentin never finishes his freshman year, but Gavin Stevens' Harvard B.A. is mentioned almost every time his character is introduced in the various texts.  The last text to mention Harvard is <em>The Mansion</em>, and there Faulkner adds a perplexing twist to the role Harvard plays in the story of Yoknapatawpha.  Gavin's nephew Charles Mallison attends the college in his turn, and while he's there he becomes friends with a young man named Spoade, whose ""father had been at Harvard back in 1909 with Uncle Gavin"" (229).  Spoade is a character in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>; 1909 is when Quentin enrolls at Harvard. <em>The Mansion</em> mentions Quentin as the Compson who ""committed suicide at the end of his freshman year"" at Harvard (354); it does not explain how Gavin and Quentin could have been there at the same time and yet apparently never met.  The other Faulkner character who attends Harvard is the enigmatic Paul de Montigny in ""Elly.""  According to Elly's racist grandmother, Paul is black - in the Jim Crow definition of that term, by which any Negro ancestor makes one a Negro.  The story suggests she's right, but Elly pushes back against the label by telling her grandmother that Paul ""went to"" Harvard and Virginia.  The grandmother rejects the possibility of his having been to the University of Virginia (which was strictly segregated until the 1950s), but says she ""can understand Harvard"" (218).  She may simply mean it's a 'Yankee' school, but in fact historically Harvard began admitting black students, in small numbers at first, shortly after the Civil War.</p>

"290","Stevens-Mallison House","","","","","","","<p>Gavin Stevens' house, like Gavin's character, becomes an increasingly important location in the 9 fictions it appears in after it is first used as a Location in <em>Light in August</em>.  It seems essentially the same in all of them, though the amount of detail about it varies considerably.  A composite description could start by noting the similarity between this place and the Compson place.  Both are in town, but have outbuildings like a pasture ""lot,"" a ""stable"" and a ""woods"" (<em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, 38, 88).  Both have been in the family for at least several generations.  Both have cabins behind them where the Negro woman who works as their servant lives.  But there's no sign of decay about the Stevens house or household. The main part of the residence is occupied by Gavin's sister Maggie Mallison and her husband, along with their child Charles or Chick - though Chick figures as Gavin's nephew much more significantly than as their son.  Gavin occupies a separate part of the house, with an outside entrance of its own, and there Gavin and others discuss several of the crimes in the <em>Knight's Gambit</em> stories and the doings of Flem and his larger Snopes family in the last two volumes of the Snopes trilogy. The most explicit indications of where the house stands in Jefferson are provided by <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>. In that novel Chick thinks about walking ""through the woods to the railroad depot"" (37-38), which puts it west of the Square.  When he rides his horse from the stable to the main road, he is clearly north of the Square (88).  To complete the comparison and contrast I'm suggesting, that location puts it diagonally on the opposite side of the Square from the Compson place.  Whether Faulkner consistently imagined it on that spot, and whether that might have had some significance for him, there's no way to know for sure.</p>

"302","Jefferson Gas Station ","","","","","","","<p>This may be the second gas station in Jefferson.  The first is the primitive one created around 1905 when the oil company, according to <em>The Reivers</em>, responded to the new presence of automobiles on American roads by adding ""a special tank of gasoline, with a pump,"" to its oil tanks by the railroad tracks (48).  The ""fillingstation"" in <em>Sanctuary</em> was specifically built to service cars (123).  The novel also calls it a ""garage,"" and describes how its pump is covered by an ""arcade"" (115).  That novel tells us exactly where it stands in Jefferson: across the street from the jail, on the corner at the end of the road on which the Benbow house stands.  The location of the ""filling station"" (305) that appears in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> is not provided, though we assume Faulkner is thinking of the same one in both novels.  The fact that Jason Compson stops there on Easter morning to get his gas tank and one of his tires filled before setting off to try to recover the money that he'd been hoarding as <em>his</em> means of salvation allows us to locate it thematically and symbolically in ironic opposition to the church that Dilsey is attending at the same moment, where she is 'filled' with what the narrative calls ""the annealment and the blood of the remembered Lamb"" (297).  This gas station, that is, measures both progress - and loss.  As a modern man, Jason lives in a material world.

The front of the undertaker's is on the Square, and in both novels the front windows - it's specifically a ""plate glass window"" in <em>Intruder</em> (179) - provide a kind of entertainment to the crowds of ""boys and youths"" who look through them at the bodies (<em>Sanctuary</em>, 112).  <em>Intruder</em> describes the boys with ""nose pressed to the glass"" (179).

In the later novel, Mrs. Downs is an ""old white woman"" who makes her living telling fortunes, curing hexes and finding lost things for a black clientele; she lives in ""a small filthy shoebox of a house that smells like a foxden in a settlement of Negro houses"" (69).</p>

"306","Holly Springs, Mississippi","","","","","","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Horace's train trip from Jefferson to Oxford and back again takes him from the county seat of Yoknapatawpha to the county seat of Lafayette, the real place on which Yoknapatawpha is based. This must have been an interesting trip for Faulkner's imagination to take. In any case the route Horace takes is practically impossible to follow. On the way to Oxford he gets off the train twice, once at dawn to eat breakfast and so to change trains (though not necessarily directions), and then ""again"" at a station filled with college students (168). On the way back he seems to change once, at Holly Springs, though between Oxford and Holly Springs the train stops at ""a small dingy station with its cryptic bulletin board chalked over"" (174), somewhere in the country. It seems, in other words, as if the narrative goes to some lengths to mystify the geographical relationship between the real Oxford and the imaginary Jefferson. The only point on this journey that is definitely established is the real town of Holly Springs, which lies about 30 miles north of Oxford.</p>

The town's ""skyline"" boasts ""roofs and a spire or two"" (139), and it is big or prosperous enough to be entered via a paved road, but there is no real town with that name in either Mississippi or Tennessee.  The description of Popeye's trip there (north through ""woods"" that give way to ""fields"") puts it more or less where the actual Holly Springs is found, but that town appears in the novel under its real name as a stop on Horace's train trip from Jefferson to Memphis.  Similar to the way the narrative describes Horace's journey, the presence of both Holly Springs and ""Dumfries"" may be part of an attempt to obfuscate Yoknapatawpha's location in northeastern Mississippi.</p>

"309","Jackson, Mississippi","","","","","","","<p>Jackson, named for President Andrew Jackson, is the capitol of Mississippi.  Faulkner re-tells a good bit of its history from 1821 to the 'present' (i.e. 1950) in the 10-page prose introductory to Act II of <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.  His narrative relies on factual accounts, but he relates the story with a good deal of facetiousness that is his own, as when he calls the capitol building, a source of pride to many Mississippians, ""this gilded pustule"" (79).  The same irreverence shapes the way Jackson figures in several of the other 7 texts that mention it, especially the ones that mention it in its political context as the seat of government.  It is where Senator Clarence Snopes serves in <em>Sanctuary</em>, ""By the People"" and <em>The Mansion</em>; the narrator of the short story refers to the ""hog trough"" at which Snopes and his colleagues enrich themselves (132).  Jackson is also where Temple Drake is from, and where her father is a judge; at one of the tense moments during her ordeal at the Old Frenchman Place in <em>Sanctuary</em>, she thinks of ""her father sitting on the porch at home, his feet on the rail, watching a negro mow the lawn"" (51). Nat Beauchamp visits the city in ""A Point of Law"" (220) though when Faulkner revised that story into the ""Fire and the Hearth"" chapter of <em>Go Down, Moses</em> he changed ""Jackson"" to ""Vicksburg,"" another city in Mississippi (68).  Jackson is also the location of the State Asylum to which Benjy Compson and Darl Bundren are committed, and to which, according to his lawyer in <em>The Mansion</em>, Mink Snopes should have been sent.  In the first two novels, going ""to Jackson"" is another way to say being committed to a mental institution.</p>

"311","Florida","","","","","","","<p>Florida suddenly becomes an important part of the Yoknapatawpha story in the last chapter of <em>Sanctuary</em>, when the city of Pensacola turns out to be where Popeye grew up: what readers learn there about his childhood - especially the disease he inherited genetically, the 'past' that was already there when he was born - puts his character in a new perspective.  For example, the fact that he is arrested (and ultimately executed for a crime he didn't commit) while driving to Florida ""to visit his mother"" means that (like Horace Benbow at the beginning of the novel) Popeye at the end is trying to go home again (302).  Driving to Florida appears again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, where the narrator speculates about what kinds of local stories the people who lived in Yoknapatawpha could tell their friends or relatives from elsewhere who ""passed through Jefferson on the way to New Orleans or Florida"" (196).  The period after World War II - which is when <em>Requiem</em> was written - saw a great surge in the number of tourists vacationing in Florida.  <em>The Mansion</em> was published after <em>Requiem</em>, but set in an earlier period, so the context for its mention of Florida is the 1930s.  Mr. and Mrs. Mallison travel annually to Miami, Florida, at Christmas time, ""to spend a week looking at horses"" (229).  They probably attend the thoroughbred races at Hialeah Park Race Track, which opened in the 1920s and became famous - for its flamingos as well as its horse races - after a reconstruction in 1932.</p>

In <em>Sanctuary</em> the hamlet where Temple Drake jumps off the train bound for a baseball game between in-state rivals to drive away with Gowan Stevens is named Taylor.  The real Taylor in Lafayette County is less than ten miles south-southwest of Oxford, and a stop on the route between the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University in Starkville.  From Taylor, Temple is taken - by a route known only to Faulkner's imagination - to the Gothic world waiting at the Old Frenchman's ruined plantation.  In <em>Sanctuary</em> the railroad station at Taylor is a very rural setting, deserted except for two wagons and a few lounging men in overalls.  In Temple's eyes, at least, it looks ""stark and ugly in the fresh morning"" (36).

""Starkville"" is the site of the baseball game against a rival college that Temple Drake never sees in <em>Sanctuary</em> (37) - a part of her story that is referred to again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, though again without naming the ""other college"" (100).  In <em>The Hamlet</em> Hoake McCarron spends a year at an ""agricultural college,"" though ""without even matriculating"" (151); the Agricultural and Mechanical College at Mississippi State was established in 1878, so again we assume he is in Starkville while 'not-attending' this school.  And when the McCallum family decides to stop growing cotton in ""The Tall Men,"" and Buddy McCallum's twin sons ""went off a year to the agricultural college to learn right about whiteface cattle"" (57), we again assume they go to Starkville.</p>

"318","On the Trains between Jefferson and Oxford","","","","","","","<p>Four important characters in <em>Sanctuary</em> ride about half a dozen different trains to get from Yoknapatawpha to Memphis or Oxford.  This entry provides a Location for those trips, which probably at times run on the same set of tracks, though that's not entirely clear. Horace Benbow, Clarence and Virgil Snopes, and Fonzo ride different trains between Jefferson and Memphis.  Horace also travels by train to Oxford, and on his return trip from there the train makes a stop at the station in Holly Springs. Holly Springs was the real town where travelers between Oxford and Memphis changed trains. It appears in other fictions and on one of Faulkner's maps as the fictional ""Memphis Junction""; it's hard to say why Faulkner uses its real name in this novel.  Otherwise Faulkner's narrative makes it difficult to retrace Horace's route to and from Oxford in Chapter 19: he takes at least 4 and probably 5 or 6 different trains.  The narrator describes the way the other passengers on the first train look in surprisingly stark and violent terms (168), and depicts a scene of college students being young and bright on the second train (168-70); on the first return train Horace has a long conversation with Clarence Snopes (172-77).  And many different kinds of people ride on these trains, including a man who ""spits tobacco juice"" onto the floor (168) and ""a countrywoman with an infant in her arms"" (170); almost parenthetically, the narrator notes the existence of the ""jim crow car,"" in which black people have to ride (168).   Faulkner may make the route between Jefferson and Oxford so hard to map because he wants to obfuscate the spatial relationship between the real town of Oxford and his fictional Jefferson; in any case, this difficulty informs our decision to use this omnibus Location as the setting for all these episodes.</p>

In <em>Sanctuary</em> Lee Goodwin is stationed there around 1917 as a member of a U.S. cavalry outfit.  While there he kills another soldier in a fight over a Filipino woman.  Two stories that Faulkner wrote and published at the beginning of World War II refer to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, which took place a day after their attack on Pearl Harbor: in ""Two Soldiers"" and ""Shall Not Perish"" the two sons of Res Grier follow the events in that distant part of the world on the radio they listen to while standing outside a neighbor's window.

"320","U.S.-Mexico Border","","","","","","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Lee Goodwin tells Horace that in the past he had been a cavalry sergeant ""on the Border"" (109).  The border is undoubtedly the one between the U.S. and Mexico.  In response to the Mexican Revolution in the second decade of the 20th century, the U.S. Army fortified a number of positions along that boundary line, and beginning in 1914 there was open military conflict between forces on the two sides of it.  Battles and skirmishes were fought at many different points along the entire border, so we can't say exactly where Lee served - but there's no reason to doubt that he did.  On the other hand, it would almost certainly be a mistake to believe the character who calls himself Captain Strutterbuck when he tells Montgomery Ward Snopes in <em>The Mansion</em> that his military experiences include fighting under General ""Black Jack"" Pershing ""on the Border in '16"" (84).  Pershing did lead 10,000 American troops into Mexico to try to capture Pancho Villa in 1916, but Strutterbuck's whole account of his career in the Army almost certainly is a fiction.</p>

Students called this complex ""The Coop"": according to A.B.

Faulkner uses the first of these nicknames for the dormitory where Temple Drake lives in <em>Sanctuary</em>.   (In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Bayard Sartoris leads a group that serenades the women students in their dorm at the state university, and one of the young men playing tennis at Belle's was expelled from the school for hanging a red light ""above the door of the girls' dormitory,"" 186)</p>

"324","Memphis: Miss Reba's","","","","","","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> Boon tells Lucius Priest that 'Miss Reba's' is ""a kind a boarding house"" (93), and in <em>Sanctuary</em> Virgil Snopes and Fonzo Snopes live there for some time on the assumption that it <em>is</em> a boarding house, one where the landlady has a lot of daughters.  But of course Miss Reba's place is a brothel, one of several in Memphis' notorious red-light district which lay at ""the foot of the bluff below Main Street"" (Sanctuary, 142).  <em>The Mansion</em> refers to this side of Memphis life in a number of passages: ""Mulberry and Gayoso and Pontotoc streets"" (68), ""that Catalpa Street house"" (305), ""joints and dives and cathouses"" (83) - these and other references point to prostitution as a major element in Memphis' tourist economy, at least in Faulkner's fictions. Even as Mink Snopes heads for a pawn shop to purchase a gun, he passes the Memphis brothel in which ""forty-seven years ago"" he slept with a white woman for the first time, and in which, unknown to him, his long estranged ""younger daughter is now the madam"" (320).  Miss Reba's is mentioned in <em>The Mansion</em>, but in two other fictions the house figures as a major narrative site.  From the outside, it's described in <em>Sanctuary</em> as a ""dingy three-storey house"" on ""a narrow dingy street of frame houses and junk yards"" (142, 191).  <em>Reivers</em> identifies the street as Catalpa (137).  Despite its seedy appearance, the brothel, at least according to Reba herself, is a very well known establishment, with a clientele that includes ""bankers, lawyers, doctors - all of them"" (143).  In that novel it is where Popeye takes Temple Drake after raping her; there she is both a prisoner and, eventually, a willing participant in a sexual relationship that shocks even Reba.  <em>The Reivers</em> also spends a lot of time in Miss Reba's.  In that novel it is less shady: there is a homelike quality to the way the 'girls' who work there are treated by Miss Reba and Mr. Binford, though the place's pretensions to gentility often wear thin.  Mr. Binford in this novel runs the house, but in <em>Sanctuary</em> it's a woman-owned and -operated business, and there's no question about how well Reba runs it.</p>

It was built on the site of the Calhoun Street Station, which in 1905 Minnie refers to as ""the Frisco depot"" in <em>The Reivers</em>,  because the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway ran in and out of Memphis on some of those tracks.  Central Station was a busy place in the era before the automobile displaced the train, full of the ""streams of people"" who repeatedly ""jostle"" Virgil Snopes and Fonzo Winbush when they get off the train around 1929 to begin their misadventures in the big city (<em>Sanctuary</em>, 189).  On his way out of the city later in the novel Horace Benbow buys a cup of coffee in the depot while waiting for the ""midnight train""; it lies ""like a hot ball"" in his stomach throughout the three hours it takes to get back to his house in Jefferson (221) - but that may be attributable to what the city has revealed to him rather than quality of the food served in the Central Station.  In ""Two Soldiers,"" while the Grier boy is at the Army Recruiting Station in Memphis, the soldiers fetch his brother, Pete, who is waiting at this station for the train to Little Rock (95).</p>

When that building burned down in 1899, an even grander hotel was built on the same spot. By the 1920s there were a number of other grand hotels in the downtown area.

Clarence takes them to this place as an economy measure.  Like so much else in Faulkner's South, the business of prostitution was shaped by the Jim Crow laws.  The prostitutes in this brothel are all black, and charge less than white prostitutes in the white houses.

We assume this district was the all-white, middle class Normal Station neighborhood in the area of the University of Memphis.  In 1911 'business houses and negroes' were 'restricted' away from this area for a period of 25 years.

In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> it ""flows from the roots of a beech"" in the woods.  Shaken after Yankee soldiers appear at the plantation and chase Colonel Sartoris away, his son Bayard goes down to this spring.  While the sound of the soldiers' horses grows fainter and the ""final light of the day"" shines on his face, Bayard looks at his reflection in the spring and sees, ""staring back at him for a sudden moment, a skull"" (91).  It could be a premonition of his death, or of the much more imminent 'death' of the Confederacy and the Old South - or both.  Just a few years later (in the fictional chronology of Yoknapatawpha) and about six years later (in the real chronology of Faulkner's career) Drusilla Hawk goes ""down to the spring"" beside ""the big beech"" in ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" looking for refuge after the life she wants to live is destroyed by her mother and the ladies of Jefferson who (not unlike those Yankee soldiers) arrive at Sartoris and, by insisting that she wear the dress of a Southern lady and marry, drive her dream away (67, 201).</p>

The part of Virginia where their journey begins, the mountains that would become the new state of West Virginia during the Civil War, and the part where it ends, the Tidewater that was the first place the English colonized in the U.S., have separate entries too.  The long journey across the rest of the state that the family takes in ""a lop-sided two wheeled cart"" pulled by ""two spavined oxen"" occupies only a few dense pages in the novel (181), but what the details emphasize is the ""fall"" from the egalitarian frontier world into the class- and race-conscious slave-owning South (180).  ""My Grandmother Millard"" includes an event that occurs ""in the office of the Richmond editor"" of a Southern periodical (673).  Many of the whites who settle Yoknapatawpha in other fictions hale from Virginia - including V.K. Ratliff's first American ancestor; in <em>The Mansion</em> Ratliff insists on taking the train to New York so he can see the places in Virginia where that ancestor spent time (184).  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, Quentin Compson is in Virginia on a train going the other way, from Harvard to Mississippi, when he sees an old Negro on a mule and feels a sense of homecoming (86-88).

Quentin and Caddy do consistently call it ""Benjy's pasture,"" because going into it is apparently one of his main sources of pleasure as a child (174).  But by 1910 this land has been sold to pay for Quentin to go to Harvard, and by 1928 it has been turned into a golf course, on the other side of a fence Benjy is not allowed to cross.  During the novel Benjy spends a lot of time standing behind this fence, remembering the pasture or repeatedly watching the golfers, whose calls of ""here, caddie"" are a constant source of pain (3).

The ground immediately behind the house is described by the narrator as ""bare,"" ""as though from the soles of bare feet in generations"" (266).  Like the honeysuckle Quentin hates the smell of, the bareness of the ground is a sign of decline - the family cannot afford yardmen to pull out the vines or maintain the lawn.

"378","Compson Inset: Pear Tree","","","","","","","<p>This is the tree that Benjy Compson refers to as ""the flower tree"" (3).  Faulkner himself referred to it often as the setting for the image with which <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> first took hold of his imagination: as he told an audience at the University of Virginia, for example, the novel ""began with the - the picture of the - the little girl's muddy drawers, climbing that tree to look in the parlor window with her brothers that didn't have the courage to climb the tree waiting to see what she saw.""  Benjy remembers watching Caddy climb up ""that tree"" in 1898 and ends his day in 1927 watching Caddy's daughter climb down it for the last time (39, 74).  In the novel's fourth section the narrator describes it as a ""pear tree"" growing ""close against the house""; in April it is ""in bloom,"" and the breeze carries ""the forlorn scent of the blossoms"" through the open window of Miss Quentin's room and into the house (282).  When Faulkner wrote the novel he almost certainly wanted readers to associate this tree with both the Tree in the garden of Eden (Versh reminds Caddy that ""your paw"" - the father - ""told you to stay out of that tree,"" but as Caddy replies, ""That was a long time ago,"" 39), and the Cross that Reverend Shegog refers to in his Easter sermon as one of ""the sacred trees"" at Calvary (296).  But when Faulkner wrote the ""Appendix"" to the novel about sixteen years later, he sacrifices this symbolic context: Caddy's climb up the tree isn't mentioned there, and four times in the short text he notes that what Miss Quentin climbed down was a ""rainpipe"" (335, 338, 341, 342).</p>

"382","Compson Inset: Kitchen","","","","","","","<p>As was once typical in the homes of white southerners with Negro slaves or servants, the Compsons' kitchen is almost a separate structure: only one story high and built directly out from the back of the main house.  From the slave-owners' or white employers' point of view, this design helped keep the heat and odor of cooking out of the 'big house,' and served as kind of fire protection for it.  At the same time provided the black slaves or servants with a place indoors where they could meet away from white eyes and talk with each other.  Throughout the Yoknapatawpha fictions, Faulkner sets scenes with blacks in kitchens far more often than in fields.  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the kitchen is presided over by Dilsey, who cooks and bakes on the big wood-burning stove.  Atypical, culturally, is the presence of Benjy in the kitchen (as in the African American church as well), but the fact that he eats there rather than in the dining room can be attributed to his mother's attitude toward his handicap.

"389","Whiteleaf Creek and Bridge","","","","","","","<p>There are two ""Whiteleaf"" creeks in the fictions, or one that seems to flow in two different directions - and a hamlet named ""Whiteleaf"" as well.  There's no obvious way to see how these three locations might be put in any one place on a map.  In <em>As I Lay Dying</em> ""Whiteleaf"" refers to a creek that the Bundren's cross over between their farm and Samson's, where ""the willows leaning near enough"" to the road allow Cash to reach out of the wagon and break off a branch (109).  On its own the topography of Yoknapatawpha in <em>As I Lay Dying</em> is unusually hard to map, but the situation becomes still more confusing in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> when Vinson Gowrie's killer is caught trying to ambush the sheriff as he travels through ""a lonely midnight creek bottom"" while taking Lucas to another jail in the town called Hollymount (227).  The narrative refers to the place where the trap is sprung variously as ""Whiteleaf bridge"" (213), ""Whiteleaf bottom"" (215) and ""the Whiteleaf fill"" (216), and the road the sheriff is traveling as ""the old Whiteleaf cutoff"" (216).  All this implies the presence of a Whiteleaf creek.  But the creek in <em>Dying</em> flows into the Yoknapatawpha River from the south.   If the creek in <em>Intruder</em> flows into the Yoknapatawpha, it would have to be from the north.  The hamlet of Whiteleaf has its own entry; it is on the northern side of the river, but is not in a ""lonely"" part of the county.  There is a Yellow Leaf Creek in the real Lafayette County.  The water in it behaves like creek water should, flowing steadily in one direction - south - into Yocona River.</p>

"390","Haley Bottom","","","","","","","<p>The place called ""Haley bottom"" appears only in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, the third Yoknapatawpha novel.  Although it is the first text in which Faulkner calls his county ""Yoknapatawpha"" (203), it is clear that he is still working out the topographical details of this new world.  Once the Bundrens cross the flooded river, they should be able to travel straight from Frenchman's Bend to Jefferson.  But according to Armstid, ""the levee through Haley bottom had done gone for two miles and . . . the only way to get to Jefferson would be go around by Mottson"" (185).  Although this is vague, it seems to be saying that a levee built between the road to town and a creek at a particularly low place (a ""bottom"") has been carried away by the rising water.  Anse confirms this when he tells the Mottson sheriff that they are in his town because ""the road was washed out"" (204).  In any case, the road's impassibility makes the Bundrens' journey take several days longer - a good enough reason for Faulkner to include this creek and levee as part of the landscape of Yoknapatawpha.  No where else, however, neither on Faulkner's maps nor in any of the other fictions, is there a creek alongside the road between the Bend and Jefferson.</p>

"391","Mount Vernon, Mississippi","","","","","","","<p>There is a real Mount Vernon in northern Mississippi. Measured from Oxford, the original of Jefferson, it is eighteen miles to the southeast.  In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> it is referred to as a ""hamlet"" ""six miles away"" from the MacCallum place, where the ""young woman"" whom Lee MacCallum is courting lives (350-51).  The MacCallums live over fourteen miles northeast of Jefferson, so by putting his 'Mount Vernon' even further away from his version of Oxford - i.e. from Jefferson - Faulkner may be trying to disguise the relationship between reality and his fictional re-presentation of it.  ""Mount Vernon"" is mentioned a second time in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, again in connection with the MacCallums: discussing the Bundrens' plan to get to Jefferson, Samson says they ""could have gone around up by Mount Vernon, like MacCallum did"" on his way home (119).</p>

"393","The Biblical World","","","","","","","<p>Although Faulkner's own religious beliefs are a vexed subject, there is no question that the world he created in his fictions is peopled with Christians - particularly Protestants - who think of the Bible as ""the Book"" (<em>Go Down, Moses</em>, 243).  That's what Ike McCaslin calls it when he tries to explain to his skeptical cousin why he feels compelled to renounce his McCaslin inheritance.  Several times in his disquisition Ike refers to events in the Bible in a way that brings the landscape of scripture into a kind of physical focus - ""He created the earth, made it and looked at it and said it was all right"" (243) - and that requires us to treat Ike's Biblical world as a Digital Yoknapatawpha Location.  This happens in two other texts as well.  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the Easter sermon that the Reverend Shegog preaches transports the congregation back to the world described in the Bible: Egypt, where the Israelites were held as slaves; Bethlehem, where the Roman soldiers came to kill Mary's infant; Jerusalem, with the hill at Calvary and ""de sacred trees"" (the three crosses, 296) and the tomb that was the site of ""de resurrection"" (297).   And while no scene in ""Shall Not Perish"" takes place in what used to be called ""the Holy Land"" and is now referred to as the Middle East, the story's narrator notes that Grandfather was ""so old that it would seem to me he must have gone clean back to the old fathers in Genesis and Exodus that talked face to face with God"" (111).</p>

During the early 20th century these urban areas were served by a number of streetcar lines, but it is doubtful that Faulkner had specific routes in mind.

The bridge Quentin visits in the morning, to hide the weights he will put in his pockets when he returns that night to end his life, is an ""interurban"" train ride away from Harvard and Boston (104), in an area that seems rural enough, with trees and a swimming hole, to suggest the less developed world he left behind in Mississippi.

"406","Boston, Massachusetts","","","","","","","<p>Boston is the capital of Massachusetts and its largest city.  Quentin spends part of the last day of his life there in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>: in a restaurant, a jeweler's and a hardware store - those places each have a separate entry in this index, but it should perhaps be noted here that Faulkner uses Boston and its environs in that novel, first, as his equivalent to the Dublin that Bloom wanders through in Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>, and also as a representation of modernity along the lines of T.S. Eliot's ""Unreal City"" in <em>The Waste Land</em>: his 'Boston' is urban, industrial,  squalid, and non-Anglo-Saxon.  In a sense it's the antithesis of the Old South, at least as Quentin nostalgically conceives that time and place.  Similarly, <em>The Hamlet</em> uses ""Boston"" as a kind of cultural shorthand to represent 'the North'; V.K. Ratliff refers to ""Boston, Maine"" - probably with his tongue in his cheek - as a different kind of place from Yoknapatawpha (89).  <em>Go Down, Moses</em> uses ""Boston""  to represent the same kind of distinction, though in that context it is associated in particular with the abolitionists whose anti-slavery campaign helped bring on the Civil War: that text refers not just to ""the New England mechanics"" and [Boston] ""bankers,"" but also, disparagingly, to ""the Boston-bred (even when not born in Boston) spinster descendants of long lines of similarly-bred and likewise spinster aunts and uncles whose hands knew no callus except that of the indicting pen"" and whose civilized world was defined by Boston's ""Beacon Hill"" (273).  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> ""Boston"" is one of four non-Southern cities (along with ""Chicago and Kansas City and Philadelphia"") that is cited as an epitome of municipal political corruption (192).  Harvard, the prestigious university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just next to Boston, is mentioned as one of the places at which the novel's hypothetical non-Southern reader may have been educated: ""yourself the stranger, the outlander from B.A. (or perhaps even M.A.) at Harvard or Northwestern or Stanford"" (205).</p>

They call the mill ""Bigelow's""; if it is like the other mills built along the river to take advantage of water power, there is a dam across the river behind which the water would likely be quiet and deep.  The mill is a popular swimming spot - one of the boys mentions ""a lot of fellows splashing"" there (121); Quentin and the little girl get there later, after walking ""almost"" a mile down a road with no houses on it (135).

"415","Compson Place: The Branch","","","","","","","<p>What the Compsons in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> refer to as ""the branch"" is a small creek that runs alongside their property.  As children they played in it.  It is where Caddy got her ""drawers"" (underwear) muddy in 1898, and where she returns a dozen years later after having sex for the first time.  In one of Faulkner's many ironies, it is also where Benjy sees a group of black women washing the clothes of their white customers.  In a story Faulkner wrote half a dozen years after the novel he seems to add another strange chapter to the story of this branch.  ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" is one of the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories he wrote about the Sartoris family during and just after the Civil War.  But the Compson family makes an appearance in it when the narrative mentions ""Mrs. Compson's husband.""  This Mr. Compson has been ""locked up for crazy"" for a long time, but before the Civil War he used to ""gather up"" a group of enslaved children and ""line them up across the creek"" while he shoots sweet potatoes off their heads (62).  It's a confusing event, because it's hard to figure out who this ""husband"" might be.

"419","University of Virginia, Charlottesville","","","","","","","<p>The University of Virginia was established in Charlottesville in 1819 as the creation of Thomas Jefferson, whose last name is at the center of all the maps of Yoknapatawpha as the name of the city that is the county seat.  Faulkner himself first visited the University in the fall of 1931, as one of the participants in a conference on Southern writers; according to reports from others in attendance, he was drunk every time they saw him.  Faulkner acquitted himself much more respectably during the two semesters he spent here as Writer-in-Residence in the late 1950s.  At one of his first public appearances in Charlottesville, however, he told the audience that he liked Virginians because they were all snobs.  Afterwards he had to explain what he meant.  His attitude toward the University of Virginia is also ambivalent.  In his first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, both the Sartoris twins begin college there, but because they can't seem to behave, the family decides to  ""separate 'em,"" as Jenny puts it; they shoot dice and the loser, Johnny, has to transfer to Princeton (380).  In <em>Sanctuary</em> Gowan Stevens boasts about having graduated from Virginia, where he claims several times that ""they taught him how to drink like a gentleman"" (57).  However, he's drunk when he says that, and in the novel his drinking results in his getting a woman into a very perilous situation at the Old Frenchman place and then unchivalrously abandoning her to a terrible fate; halfway through the novel he sneaks out of Yoknapatawpha in disgrace.  A third reference to UVA occurs in the short story ""Elly.""  Elly tries to convince her racist grandmother - writing it out because of the old woman's deafness - that Paul de Montigny ""is not a negro he went to Va. and Harvard"" (218).  The grandmother, already sure that Paul is black, doesn't believe her.  But while he could have been both a Negro and a Harvard student, Elly is right that if he attended Virginia he couldn't have been black: no African Americans were admitted to the University until several decades after the story takes place - just before the time Faulkner became its Writer-in-Residence - and the student body wasn't fully integrated until after the Civil Rights movement.</p>

"421","Jefferson Negro Church","","","","","","","<p>The first Negro church mentioned in the fictions has burned down before <em>Flags in the Dust</em> begins, which is why its pastor refers to it as the ""late Fust Baptis' church"" (286). It is where Simon Strothers worshipped, and as a ""Deacon"" had possession of the funds that the congregation was saving to build the Second Baptist church (286).  In that novel readers meet that preacher and half a dozen members of his congregation, but hear nothing more about the church or where its building was located.  In <em>The Mansion</em>, published in 1960 as Faulkner's penultimate book, the narrator says that the ""Sunday School"" where (the white) Linda Snopes Kohl teaches after her return from Spain meets in ""one of the Negro churches"" in Jefferson (104, 254).  This is the only explicit indication in the fictions that Faulkner imagines more than one ""Negro church"" in town.  There certainly always could have been two or more, but it seems that the more accurate way to represent the church variously attended by Simon, and Dilsey (in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>), Sam Fathers (in ""The Old People""), and Tom-Tom (in ""Centaur in Brass"" and <em>The Town</em>) is to treat it in all five texts as the same church.  None of these other churches are identified by denomination, though their congregations are definitely Protestant.  The one church that is most fully described is in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, which is the only text to set an event there.  The event is the powerful Easter sermon preached by the Reverend Shegog, and that the novel juxtaposes to Jason's chase after his niece and his money.  The setting is ""a weathered church"" with a ""crazy steeple"" (292); inside it is decorated for Easter ""with sparse flowers from kitchen gardens and hedgerows, and with streamers of colored crepe paper"" (292).  On the other hand, even if this <em>is</em> the ""Negro church"" Sam Fathers goes to ""now and then"" in ""The Old People"" (203), it can hardly be the one he attends in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.  The novel uses the same phrase - Sam goes to ""the negro church now and then"" (161) - but in that text Sam lives on the McCaslin plantation, which is fifteen miles from Jefferson, rather than the ""farm four miles from Jefferson"" where he lives in ""Old People"" (203). The McCaslin place puts a church in Jefferson too far away for the Negroes, many if not all of whom would have to walk there, so on the map of that novel we relocate the church to the county - which is what Faulkner must have done in his own imagination.</p>

Standing on a siding are the ""show cars,"" ""two gaudily painted pullmans"" with a few drying clothes hanging out the windows (308).  The station is deserted on an Easter Sunday morning.  His niece is not there.  This station is also the place in <em>Light in August</em> where the Hineses catch the ""two a.m."" train to Jefferson (359), and in <em>The Town</em> where Gavin Stevens changes trains to ""catch the express from Memphis to New York,"" though in this novel the place is called ""Mottstown junction"" (107). (In Faulkner's other Yoknapatawpha fictions, this change would occur north of Yoknapatawpha, in the town he calls ""Memphis Junction."")  Mottstown may also be the town ""in the next county"" where, according to this novel, Flem and Eula marry (6), though this is a variant like the alternative spellings of Mottstown, since in the other fictions that mention Flem and Eula's marriage the event happens in Jefferson.</p>

At the beginning of the episode in both ""Mule in the Yard"" and <em>The Town</em>, the house stands on the edge of town near the railroad tracks. It is a ""little wooden house painted the same color that the railroad company used on its stations and boxcars"" (243).

"425","County Poorhouse","","","","","","","<p>Before the Social Security Act of 1935, many localities in the U.S. had 'poor houses' or 'poor farms' to give destitute elderly or handicapped people some place to live (at poor farms they were often required to work for their support).  In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Will Falls lives at ""the county Poor Farm,"" which is three miles out of town (3).  All we know for sure about ""the poorhouse"" where Old Het lives in ""Mule in the Yard"" is that it is ""a three-mile walk"" from Mrs. Hait's house in Jefferson (264).  But since that's exactly the same distance from Jefferson as the poorhouse in which Old Will Falls lives in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, and she is black while he is white, it seems possible that ""the poorhouse"" (249, 264) is one of the very few integrated spaces in Yoknapatawpha. On the other hand, when Faulkner revised the story of I.O. Snopes and the mule in Mrs. Hait's yard for inclusion in <em>The Town</em>, one of the changes he made was to halve the distance Old Het has to walk to get back to ""the poorhouse"": it's now a ""mile-and-a-half walk"" (268).

It is still, as in the novel, where the Harvard crew teams row.  However, like most of the Massachusetts settings in Quentin's section, the drawbridge where Quentin gets off the trolley, looks at the Charles River ""healing out to the sea"" (90), and then watches Gerald Bland take a shell from a boathouse and start rowing is apparently Faulkner's invention.  Because of the ""schooner"" he watches passing through the open bridge, it seems likely that all this is taking place closer to Boston Harbor than Harvard (89).</p>

"433","Jefferson Farmers' Supply Store","","","","","","","<p>The economy of Jefferson - the business that is done in the banks and the stores - revolves largely around the needs and wants of the farmers and planters who live in the surrounding county.  But three texts refer specifically to a ""farmer's supply store"" in town; when in Faulkner's last novel Lucius Priest visits it on his weekly round collecting money owed his father's livery stable, it is even named the ""Farmer's Supply"" (""Mule in the Yard,"" 257; ""Appendix Compson,"" 333; <em>Reivers</em>, 43). The one text that describes it is the ""Appendix,"" in which it is the place where Jason Compson has an office of sorts as a ""cotton dealer"" (333).  When the town librarian goes to see him there, it is described as a ""gloomy cavern which only men ever entered - a cavern cluttered and walled and stalagmitehung with plows and discs and loops of tracechain and singletrees and mulecollars and sidemeat and cheap shoes and horselinament and flour and molasses"" (333).  The narrative explains that the gloom has a racial inflection: ""since those who supplied Mississippi farmers or at least Negro Mississippi farmers for a share of the crop"" were anxious to sell their black customers only what they needed to make the crop, and so the store's merchandise was ""hidden"" from view (334).  This description clearly distinguishes 'supply stores' from the 'hardware stores' that serve the farming population in other fictions; Jefferson's hardware stores are not so strongly defined by gender and racial segregation.  I.O. Snopes can ""usually be found"" at the ""farmer's supply store"" in ""Mule in the Yard,"" and he's white - though of course he is also a Snopes (257).  We can speculate that Faulkner thinks of supply stores as serving a poorer and darker clientele, but there's not really enough evidence in these three texts to feel comfortable with such a generalization.</p>

"435","Jefferson Grocery Store","","","","","","","<p>The representation of retail business in Faulkner's Jefferson occasionally acknowledges or overtly reflects the economic and racial stratifications that are a social fact of the town.  In ""Uncle Willy,"" at least, Willy Christian's seedy drugstore explicitly serves customers whom the white narrator of that story calls ""country people"" and ""niggers"" (226) - until a new clerk cleans it up enough to attract a ""new town trade"" among the white middle class (233).  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Jason Compson thinks about the white man in Jefferson who ""made a lot of money selling rotten goods to niggers"" (194).  The six grocery stores in this entry seem to belong in the same category.  In ""Mule in the Yard"" I.O. Snopes is accosted by Old Het ""before a cheap grocery store"" that seems to be patronized by ""Negroes"" (259).  The narrator of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> describes the store Mr. Lilley owns as ""a small shabby street grocery whose customers were mostly Negroes""; Gavin Stevens mentions that the store sells them chewing gum, bluing, bananas, sardines, shoelaces, hair straightener, meat, candy, lard - presumably among other 'goods' (47).  In ""Uncle Willy,"" ""Sonny Barger's store"" in the Negro district of Jefferson seems to be as seedy a place as Willy's drugstore (234).  Gail Hightower in <em>Light in August</em> does his ""semiweekly marketing"" in an ""odorous and cluttered"" store, with ""flyspecked tins"" of food on its ""dingy shelves"" (308, 309).  In ""Centaur in Brass"" Flem Snopes spends ""two or three nights a week"" sitting by the stove in a ""smelly, third-rate grocery"" (152).  It's less clear that the ""grocer's"" where Jason Compson's ""friend from Memphis"" buys food every weekend belongs in this category, but if we assume that she is probably a prostitute, it seems more likely than not.  We can also assume that these kinds of businesses are on the edges rather than in the center of town.  Like the store in Jason's anecdote, it's likely that they are owned by whites.</p>

"439","Mississippi State Insane Asylum (Jackson)","","","","","","","<p>Historically, the Mississippi State Insane Asylum was opened in Jackson in 1855, and operated there until 1935.  In Faulkner's fictions it is simply referred to as ""the asylum"" or ""Jackson"" - or, by Ratliff in ""A Bear Hunt,"" ""the Jackson a-sylum"" (75).  Two of Faulkner's most memorable characters are committed there: Benjy Compson and Darl Bundren. That his brother Benjy hasn't been shipped off to Jackson is one of Jason Compson's persistent grievances in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>; when Faulkner wrote the ""Appendix"" to the novel about fifteen years later, he revealed that after their mother's death Jason had his way - though about a dozen years after that, in <em>The Mansion</em>, he complicated the story by revealing that Mrs. Compson's cried so much after Benjy was committed that Jason agreed to bring ""Benjy back home"" - though that doesn't provide the story with a happy ending.  At the end of <em>As I Lay Dying</em> Darl Bundren is forcibly restrained and taken by agents of the state to Jackson.  The youngest Bundren, Vardaman, keeps repeating variations on ""Darl he went to Jackson,"" as if the repetition could explain it (249-52).  Cash Bundren wonders if it isn't ""better so for"" his brother (261), but given the way Darl's last section in the novel ends, with him either in the asylum or imagining himself there - ""in a cage in Jackson where, his grimed hands lying light in the quiet interstices, looking out he foams"" (254) - there's certainly no happy ending here either.  The other character who ends up there is Henry Armstid, in <em>The Town</em>, after falling victim to one of Flem Snopes' schemes (in <em>The Hamlet</em>).  Mink Snopes does not go to Jackson in <em>The Mansion</em>, though that's where his lawyer argues he belongs.  And in a confusing but intriguing passage in ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" as a short story and a chapter in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, it seems possible that one of Benjy's ancestors, a husband of ""Mrs. Compson,"" was sent there too; according to Bayard Sartoris' narrative he was ""locked up for crazy"" though we don't know where (62, 193).  Ratliff mentions ""Jackson"" because of the ""wild"" look on Luke Provine's face, a reference that suggests how common 'going to Jackson' was among Faulkner's people as a kind of synonym for 'crazy.'  But in the fictions Faulkner's use of 'Jackson' suggests how porous is the distinction between 'sanity' and 'madness.'</p>

The closest the narrative gets to the show is when Jason Compson drives his niece to school and sees the show people ""putting up the tent"" (188), but Job and Luster and a large number of country people go to see it, and the sound of the band playing in the tent (230 etc.) provides a kind of (largely unheard) sound track to the afternoon Jefferson events in Jason's section.

"441","Jefferson School","","","","","","","<p>It is not possible to get Faulkner's representation of the public school system in Jefferson into a clear and consistent focus.  A pair of texts acknowledge the reality of Jim Crow segregation, and distinguish the ""Negro"" school from the ""white"" one, and a few more establish the existence of a separate ""high school"" for older public school students - both these categories have their own Locations in our database.  This entry includes the schools that are neither ""Negro"" nor exclusively ""high,"" though the earliest such examples reveal the difficulty of trying to sort Faulkner's fiction into specific data fields.  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin remembers a shameful moment from his own school days, when he's too preoccupied to realize that the teacher is asking him a question.  The question Miss Laura is asking - ""who discovered the Mississippi River?"" (88) - suggests what we would call middle school, though in Faulkner's world the all the grades before high school were aggregated in what was called 'grammar school.'  Quentin's namesake in the novel, however, Caddie's 17-year-old daughter Quentin, is clearly in high school.  But when Jason takes her there on Friday morning, he refers to ""the school house,"" as if there were a single school building for all the town's children (188) - on that basis we assume there is one 'school' as a Location in this novel.  In ""Hair,"" on the other hand, the narrative explicitly states that Susan Reed attends school in Jefferson <em>until</em> she reaches adolescence, so there's no question that she's in grammar school when she walks past the barbershop ""each morning and afternoon"" (132).  Yet the story's reference to a ""high-school"" boy suggests again that all the grades, from elementary through high school, are taught in one ""building"" (135). Although the idea of a ""consolidated"" school - like the one in Frenchman's Bend the narrator of ""Two Soldiers"" attends - cannot be ruled out in the other three texts that refer to schools, those texts involve children of grammar school age (""Miss Zilphia Gant,"" ""Uncle Willy"") or who are in grammar school despite being older.  That's the endearing case with Wallstreet Panic Snopes in <em>The Town</em>, who is twelve when he enters ""kindergarten"" along with his 6-year-old brother (153) and proposes to his second-grade teacher in her classroom, the ""empty room itself smelling of chalk and anguished cerebration and the dry inflexibility of facts"" (153).  This empty classroom, along with the scene of Quentin's discomfiture, are among the very few times Faulkner's imagination ever goes <em>inside</em> Jefferson's schools.</p>

"442","Jefferson Post Office","","","","","","","<p>For most of Faulkner's career the Oxford post office was the portal through which he sent off manuscripts to agents, editors and publishers 1100 miles away in New York, and where he received back rejections, acceptances, royalties and advances.  The Jefferson post office, on the other hand, plays a much less significant role in the fictions that refer to it.  In ""A Rose for Emily"" the narrator mentions that sometime before 1920 ""the town got free postal delivery"" at home (128), though it is well after that date that, for example, that Jason Compson stops at the ""postoffice"" to get the mail (<em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, 189).  <em>The Mansion</em>, which spans much of the first half of the 20th century, briefly notes how progress effects the postal system.  In an event set around 1910, it describes ""the small lot behind the postoffice where the RFD carriers' buckboards would stand until the carriers came out the back door with the bags of mail"" (41); RFD - Rural Free Delivery to people living in places like the Yoknapatawpha countryside - began in the late 19th century, though horse- or mule-drawn ""buckboards"" were replaced by trucks and cars in most rural areas by the 1920s.  It's how the Griers receive the official notification of their older son's death in World War II.  In the summer of 1923 Monty Snopes mentions another sign of progress: the ""cancelling machine inside the Jefferson postoffice"" - though what Monty is thinking about is the federal statute against sending pornography through the mail and the pornographic photo in the envelope with the return address of his ""Atelier Monty"" on it (76).  That is one of the more memorable things that pass through Jefferson's post office.  The mail Jason picks up includes a poignant letter from Caddy, who can only communicate with her daughter through the mails; a note from his Memphis mistress that he promptly burns; and a grandiloquent request for money from Uncle Maury.  In ""Miss Zilphia Gant"" Zilphia visits the post office once a week to get the reports from the Memphis detective agency that's keeping track of her former husband.  But mostly the fictions describe the post office as one of the places in Jefferson where the local men hang around.</p>

"445","Jefferson Opera House","","","","","","","<p>There are no operas performed in the Yoknapatawpha fictions.  Jefferson does have an ""opera house"" - but in <em>The Reivers</em> the narrator describes what kinds of entertainments were staged in it: ""balls or minstrel or drama shows"" (8).  Many places across America used 'opera house' as a kind of euphemism.  Until into the 20th century there was often a religious prejudice against play-acting and many other forms of live entertainment, but 'operas' sounded culturally more respectable.  No one demanded opera houses put on operas, and based on the evidence only certain plays were likely to be protested.  (Although Quentin Compson refers, for example, to the ""regular Uncle Tom's cabin outfit"" that Deacon wears, the dramatizations of Stowe's novel, though widely popular across most of the U.S., were very seldom performed in the Deep South, 97).  By the late 1920s, movies had closed or taken over a lot of small town playhouses.  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Jefferson's ""old opera house"" is apparently no longer in use at all; it is where ""a lot of papers and junk out of the old Merchants' and Farmer's Bank"" is stored (216).  In <em>The Town</em> (as also noted in <em>The Mansion</em>) the opera house is where the Cotillion Ball is held (75), with such disastrous consequences for Gavin Stevens.</p>

Ab's field is one of the few in Yoknapatawpha that have already been plowed; crossing it gives Jason a headache and confirms his belief in his status as a victim.

Thirty years later, Judith Sutpen wants her father's funeral to be held in ""that same Methodist church in town where he had married her mother"" (151) - but that design falls through when the wagon carrying his corpse there overturns.  That phrase ""in town"" means that this is not the church in the county ""which Sutpen rode fast to,"" to quote the caption on Faulkner's map.  There's no way, however, to know if Faulkner imagined it as the same Methodist church that Jason Compson is referring to in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> - that is, earlier in Faulkner's career, but much later in Yoknapatawpha history: the ""sun was down beyond the Methodist church now, and the pigeons were flying back and forth around the steeple"" (247).</p>

The Delta is the home to Parchman Penitentiary, which has its own entry in this index; but worth mentioning here is Mink Snopes' description when he sees the Delta for the first time while being taken to prison: a ""vast flat alluvial swamp of cypress and gum and brake and thicket lurked with bear and deer and panthers and snakes, out of which man was still hewing savagely and violently the rich ragged fields in which cotton stalks grew ranker and taller than a man on a horse"" (53).  When Jason remarks to the deputy accompanying him that ""It dont look healthy,"" the man replies ""It aint intended to be"" (53).

The specific sites included in this Location are: the street with ""white houses"" and ""picket fences"" where the boy in a ""white shirt"" climbs up a tree (123); the bakery where Quentin purchases two buns, and encounters the little immigrant girl whom he calls ""sister"" (125); the drugstore nearby where he buys ice cream for her; the several places he visits briefly while looking for her home, i.e. an unspecified ""store"" (129), the livery stable (130), the ""postoffice"" (130) and the train station (131); and finally the shabby magistrate's office in the ""one storey building of brick trimmed with white"" to which he is taken by the marshal (142).</p>

It's close enough to the Compson house for Quentin to walk (or rather, ""run"") there (159).  When they do meet, the bridge is ""in the woods"" (159).  This happens in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, which Faulkner wrote in 1929.  It was over two decades later that he wrote <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, with the prose sections that trace much of the early history of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha.  There's no way to know if Faulkner remembered Quentin and Ames' encounter when he describes ""the creek in Compson's pasture"" (33).  It is mentioned twice in that novel.  First, as the place where Grenier and Sutpen ""set up camps"" for the slaves they have brought to town to help build the courthouse (33).

On both the maps of Yoknapatawpha that Faulkner himself drew, this appears as one of the main 'spokes' that radiate out from the 'hub' at Jefferson, but Faulkner almost never does use it in his fictions.    Joe Christmas walks through the woods alongside it when he travels back and forth between town and the Burden place.  As I put together this index of locations, thinking about how Faulkner uses space, I'm tempted to say that Faulkner brings this seldom used road into the narrative here to reinforce Joanna's estrangement from the rest of Yoknapatawpha - just as it's tempting to suggest that Joe's journey through the county, which begins when he walks down this road (226-28) and climaxes three years later with his apparently aimless but thematically circular flight across county's the southwest quadrant, another part of the terrain that Faulkner's imagination seldom visits, takes place where it does so that the strange setting can intensify the estrangement of Joe's existence.</p>

"480","Burden Graveyard","Context (text, as interpreted)","<p>Like many other families in Yoknapatawpha, the Burdens have their own ""burying ground"" (<em>Light in August</em>, 249), and like most such sites, it is ""on a cedar knoll"" some distance from the house (248).  But it is unique in that the graves there are hidden, unmarked, unmounded and deliberately covered over with ""brush and things"" (249).  Joanna Burden's father Nathaniel created it when he buried her half-brother and grandfather, both named Calvin; they were killed by Colonel John Sartoris ""over a question of negro voting"" (248), and Nathaniel hid their graves to prevent the white men of Jefferson from digging up and perhaps mutilating their bodies.  When Joanna is four, Nathaniel takes her to this grove.  Although she didn't know ""what was in there,"" she doesn't want to enter it (252).  There, standing among the graves of her grandfather, brother, and mother (as well as Juana, Nathaniel's first wife, for whom she is named), her father tells her that she cannot escape either the ""shadow"" of the ""negro"" (253) or ""the white race's doom and curse for its sins"" (252).</p>

"482","Jefferson White Neighborhood","","","","","","","<p>Although according to Faulkner's 1936 map of Yoknapatawpha, the population of the county is about two-thirds black, most of the residential areas in Jefferson are white - though in a number of cases the Negro servants of upper class or older white families live in cabins behind their employers' houses. But if ""the homes of white people"" (114) and ""the houses of white people"" (115) - to quote <em>Light in August</em> - can be found in many parts of town, this 'White Neighborhood' Location refers to the part of town that is specifically distinguished from the 'Negro district' that is called Freedman Town, among other names.  This 'White Neighborhood' is described in two texts. <em>Light in August</em> is the first of them: after Joe Christmas walks at night through the Negro section, he climbs a slope into this white neighborhood.  He notes the ""chairs upon the lawn"" and ""verandas"" where ""white faces"" can be seen (115).  ""Knight's Gambit"" also juxtaposes the Negro and the white parts of town as Charles Mallison returns to Jefferson by train.  After seeing the Negroes' cabins, he sees ""the houses of white people"" (253).  As in the earlier novel, the neighborhood is between the Square and the railroad tracks, but while the economic status of the white people Joe Christmas walks past isn't clear, the neighborhood Charles is looking at is definitely lower class: these white people's houses are ""no larger than the Negro ones"" - but, he immediately adds, these ""houses"" are ""never cabins""; calling them that would mean ""you'd probably have a fight on your hands"" (253).  For the residents, the implication is that their houses are superior to the Negroes' cabins.  In the rest of its description, the narrative also defines these ""houses,"" and the folks who live in them, in the context of the blacks who live nearby - but with a very different implication: the white's houses are ""painted, or at least once-painted, the main difference being that they wouldn't be quite so clean inside"" as the Negroes' cabins (253).</p>

"484","Jefferson Restaurant","","","","","","","<p>There are at least two restaurants for white people in Jefferson.  The Side-Street Restaurant that gives Flem Snopes a foothold in the town has its own entry.  The entry brings together the various restaurants that are located on the Square at the center of town.  If there is just one of these, which is our assumption, it begins as ""Rogers,"" then appears as ""The Cafe,"" the ""All-Nite Cafe,"" the ""Allnite Inn"" and the ""Dixie Cafe.""  The most fully described of these is the one owned by Deacon Rogers in  <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  It is more than just a restaurant: its ""cluttered but clean front section"" sells groceries (119), the restaurant tables and kitchen are in the back, and beyond them, behind a door, is the small back room where young Bayard Sartoris drinks toddies made from the moonshine whisky Rafe MacCallum provides, mixed with sugar and lemons supplied by Deacon himself - all in defiance of the MIssissippi prohibition against alcohol.  Rogers is mentioned again in Faulkner's next novel, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, but not seen, because Jason rejects his boss' suggestion that he get himself ""a lunch at Rogers'"" (216).  In five later fictions there are restaurants on the Square under four different names.  It is of course possible that Faulkner imagines there is more than one restaurant on the Square, but since two or more Square restaurants never appear in the same text, we use Jefferson Restaurant to refer to ""the Cafe"" (""Uncle Willy""), the ""All-Night Cafe"" (<em>Intruder in the Dust</em>), the ""Allnite Inn"" (""Knight's Gambit"") and the ""Dixie Cafe"" (<em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>).  These texts don't say enough about these places to distinguish them from each other, with the possible exception of the ""All-Night Cafe,"" which <em>Intruder</em> calls a ""cafe which stayed open all night"" (206), and that some townspeople apparently think of it as an ""allnight jukejoint coffee stall"" (207).  Typically, however, a ""jukejoint"" has a black clientele (see the Blue Goose Cafe in <em>The Town</em>), and the cafe in <em>Intruder</em> serves whites - which is one reason we'd rather not try to parse the difference between the ""All-Night Cafe"" and the ""Allnite Inn,"" and so on.</p>

In the course of his travels, ""the thousand streets ran as one street"" (223), which we have chosen to plot on the ""World"" map (because although it seems Joe mostly travels around the U.S, he also gets into Mexico) but situated in the center of the United States as a kind of representative rather than exact Location for what happens to Joe during those years of his life.  The street is metaphorical, the narrative's way of summing up all of the traveling Joe does between the time he strikes McEachern and the time he arrives in Yoknapatawpha, and it must be measured in years as well as thousands of miles.  Among the more specific places mentioned are, in the order the narrator names them, Oklahoma, Missouri, Chicago, Detroit, Mexico, Mississippi.  Constants on this ""street"" are jails, brothels, working class neighborhoods, fields, farms:  ""he was in turn laborer, miner, prospector, gambling tout; he enlisted in the army, served four months and deserted and was never caught"" (224).</p>

Faulkner uses the lot in all three of these texts to tell the story of the wild ponies that Flem Snopes brought back with him from Texas, and the chaos that ensued after they were auctioned off and escaped from in the lot.  Actually, this event and location appear first in another text: the unfinished ""Father Abraham"" manuscript that was Faulkner's earliest Yoknapatawpha fiction.

The corn field is next to the tenant's cabin, and contains the ""rich black soil"" typical of the bottom land in Yoknapatawpha (17).  The story briefly shows Ab's two sons at work in the field, ""running a middle buster"" (17).  (A middle buster is a particular kind of plow, designed to create furrows for planting.)

"489","Road Between Jefferson and Frenchman's Bend","","","","","","","<p>The road that runs southeast from Jefferson to Frenchman's Bend is frequently traveled in the fictions.  It is variously named the ""southeast road"" (<em>The Town</em>, 4), the ""Jefferson high road"" (<em>Hamlet</em>, 390), and even the ""Valley road"" (""Shall Not Perish,"" 106) - though elsewhere the ""valley road"" is the one that runs north from Jefferson (<em>Flags in the Dust</em>, 132).  The distance between the town and the hamlet can vary in length from fiction to fiction; it's ""eight miles"" in ""Hand Upon the Waters"" (70) and twenty-two miles in ""Two Soldiers"" (88), but most often about twelve.  There is no fiction in which it is described as paved, despite the designation of ""high road,"" a designation that seems very inappropriate in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, where it's the road that the Bundrens <em>can't</em> travel because of the flooding at Haley Bottom (185).  In ""Fool About a Horse,"" where there is good reason to be concerned about whether the mules will last the trip, the road is described as going ""up them long hills"" and then ""down the hills"" (124); it is definitely more hilly closer to Jefferson.  At the end of the first chapter of <em>Light in August</em> it is from the ""crest of the final hill"" outside town that Lena Grove sees the ""two columns of smoke"" rising above the town's skyline (30).  It is on this road within four miles of Jefferson that Cotton fails to kill himself in ""The Hound""; see Site where Cotton Tries To Commit Suicide in the index. It is along this road that Flem Snopes and his relations advance in what the fictions often depict as an assault on Jefferson.  It is on this road, riding Solon Quick's home-made bus back to the Bend, that the young narrator of ""Shall Not Perish"" has his epiphany about ""America"" (114-15).  But among all the events that happen on this road, perhaps the most moving is V.K. Ratliff's unspoken vision of tragic ""waste"" as he drives back to the Bend after learning about Eula Varner's marriage to Flem in <em>The Hamlet</em>: it is September, and alongside the road ""the cotton was open and spilling into the fields""; the ""pickers"" are seen ""in stooping attitudes,"" ""fixed amid the constant surf of bursting boils like piles in surf"" (165).</p>

"490","Frenchman's Bend Schoolhouse","","","","","","","<p>The school in Frenchman's Bend plays a larger role in the collective story of Yoknapatawpha than the schools elsewhere in the county or in Jefferson do.  In fictions set before 1940, the ""schoolhouse"" is a ""one-room"" building (<em>The Town</em>, 38).  According to the Snopes trilogy it was paid for privately, by Will Varner, ""as an integer of old Varner's princedom - an integer not because old Varner or anyone else in Frenchman's Bend considered that juvenile education filled any actual communal lack or need, but simply because his settlement had to have a going schoolhouse to be complete"" (38-39).  The school year is determined by the times of planting and harvesting.  Attendance does not seem to be mandatory.  The educational situation seems more formalized in the two stories about the Grier boys.  They attend the ""Consolidated School"" (""Two Soldiers,"" 82), which suggests that all school-age children still go to the same school, but perhaps one with more than one classroom.  Pete, the oldest boy, has graduated from it.  Three of Faulkner's more memorable characters teach in the Frenchman's Bend school at different times: Addie Bundren (in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>); Labove and I.O. Snopes (both in <em>The Hamlet</em>).  Readers of the first novel know that corporeal punishment was allowed in the school, at least under Addie.  Readers of <em>The Hamlet</em> get a sense of how ill-suited both men are to the job of teaching, though perhaps if Eula Varner hadn't been his student, Labove would acquitted himself more creditably; he does organize a successful basketball program for the boys of Frenchman's Bend.  Nothing could have helped I.O.</p>

"493","Government Reservoir at Oxford","","","","","","","<p>The University of Mississippi at Oxford was always already absent when Faulkner first created Yoknapatawpha - if that isn't too Faulknerian a way to say that one of the main differences between Faulkner's world and the one it's largely based on is that there's no university in Jefferson.  After 1940 Faulkner could be said to have left out another major part of the landscape of Lafayette County: what the narrator of ""Two Soldiers"" refers to as ""that Government reservoy up at Oxford"" (81).  Sardis Lake, as this reservoir is called, was built as a reservoir and flood control project during the Depression, one of the Roosevelt Administration’s public works.  Opened in 1940, it flooded fourteen miles of the Tallahatchie, the river that marks the northern boundary of Yoknapatawpha and that flows undammed - to use another Faulkneresque locution - through all the fictions.  Faulkner himself regularly made recreational use of the lake.</p>

"496","Northwest Road|Jefferson to Memphis","","","","","","","<p>The road that leaves Jefferson to head northwest is given a name only once: when Max Harriss races his car around the Square in ""Knight's Gambit"" and takes a skidding turn out of town, the story says he's driving off on ""the Memphis highway"" (213-14).  We assume this is also the route toward Memphis that Granny takes with Bayard and Ringo during the Civil War in ""Retreat,"" and the one that the bus carrying the younger Grier to Memphis takes during the Second World War in ""Two Soldiers.""  Some accounts of <em>The Reivers</em> assume it's also the road over which Boon, Lucius and Ned bounce on their way to Memphis, and that is certainly possible, but our reading of the novel suggests they travel directly north from Jefferson on what Faulkner elsewhere calls the 'Valley road.'  Besides Memphis, there are two major reasons to travel this road: Sutpen's Hundred and the Big Bottom.  Sutpen's is twelve miles out of town on the road, which becomes the site of several memorable moments in <em>Absalom!</em>  Early in his marriage Sutpen turns the road ""into a race track"" on Sunday mornings (15).  Judith tries to use it to take her father's corpse to town for a funeral, but somewhere along the road the mules pulling the wagon ""bolt"" and Sutpen's body - dressed in his Confederate ""regimentals,"" with ""sabre and embroidered gauntlets"" - tumbles ""into a ditch"" (151).  The unpaved roads of Yoknapatawpha create a lot of dust in the fictions, but no  description of that is more evocative than Quentin's trip with Rosa up this road through the darkness of a hot September night in 1909: ""the trees along the road not rising soaring as trees should but squatting like huge fowl, their leaves ruffled and heavily separate like the feathers of panting fowls, heavy with sixty days of dust, the roadside undergrowth coated with heat-vulcanised dust"" (143). The Big Bottom is the large area of wilderness in which men from offices in Jefferson and plantations in Yoknapatawpha hunt deer and bear for two weeks every November.  It occupies much of the same space on a map of Yoknapatawpha as Sutpen's Hundred, and the 'hunting camp' in which they stay during the hunting trips was originally built by Sutpen as a fishing camp.  But the hunting stories Faulkner wrote don't focus on the road - which might have suggested too inescapable a relationship between the woods and society; they tend to begin describing the landscape at the moment when the horses and wagons turn off the highway into ""the big woods,"" ""profound, sentient, gigantic and brooding"" (<em>Go Down, Moses</em>, 167).</p>

Het used to carry her few possessions in a carpetbag, but that was before ""the ten cent store came to Jefferson"" (242) - a detail like the newfangled ""zipper"" suggesting how this kind of store is another sign of 20th century progress.  Sometimes called 'dimestores' or 'five-and-dime stores,' the first ""ten cent stores"" were opened in Pennsylvania by the Woolworth Brothers in the late 19th century. By the early 20th century they were common in the South.  They were known for the variety of low-cost merchandise they stocked, and for giving their customers direct access to the merchandise (instead of having to ask a clerk to get things).  They also, as Het knows, ""gave away"" paper bags so that their customers could carry the goods they bought home themselves (242).</p>

There's a nice equivocation in the word ""skeleton"" here - it's November, so only the cotton- and corn-stalks remain in the fields, but metaphorically, at least for Ike McCaslin and his mentor Sam Fathers, there's the suggestion that the familiar social world is death to the spirit, whereas this door opens to its true home.</p>

The text also comments that where the ridge begins there is ""a tremendous pin oak"" (208). The path along the ridge is intersected at intervals by deer crossings.

Such crossings are good places to wait for game.  It is where Sam Fathers teaches Quentin Compson (in ""The Old People""), the unnamed boy (in ""The Bear""), and Ike McCaslin (in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>) how to hunt big game.  In the second two texts it is the site of each young hunter's first encounter Old Ben, <em>the</em> bear.  While Faulkner does not provide much information as to its precise whereabouts in those texts it is near enough to camp to cause the boy to be surprised that the bear would ever wander so close to people, to which Sam responds that the bear ""do it every year . . .

Here too, as in ""A Justice"" and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Sam lives ""among Negroes, in a cabin among the other cabins"" (203).  This story calls the larger property a ""farm"" (203), and the Negroes who work on it are tenant farmers or sharecroppers, but its layout suggests the design of a slave plantation, where the slaves lived in the 'quarters' somewhere behind the owners' big house.  Although this story doesn't use the word 'quarters,' the two other texts that refer to Sam's cabin - the earlier ""A Justice,"" where he lives on the Compson farm, and the slightly revised version of this story that Faulkner publishes in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, where he works for the McCaslins and the Edmondses, both do.  In the latter text, for example, Faulkner revises the phrase to read ""a cabin among the other cabin in the quarters"" (161).

"532","Big Woods|Big Bottom","","","","","","","<p>For Faulkner aficionados the ""big woods"" in his hunting stories are a place like the pathless wilderness where Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook have adventures in Cooper's Leather-Stocking Tales or the big river where Huck Finn and Jim travel on the raft in Mark Twain's novel - one of the enchanted places in the American imaginary.  If Faulkner's ""South"" is haunted by its past and divided up by issues of race and class and gender, the ""big woods"" apparently offers a kind of escape into a world that is timeless and whole.  There is nothing symbolic or spiritual about the place in ""A Bear Hunt"": this earliest hunting story derives from a different literary tradition, usually referred to as 'South-Western Humor,' and though it is set at De Spain's camp in the ""wild"" bottom of the Tallahatchie River where the other hunting stories take place (65), and even includes a mysterious Indian mound, the story Faulkner stages there deploys the setting for essentially comic purposes.  A year later, however, in the story ""Lion,"" Faulkner introduces <em>the</em> bear into the setting, and although Jefferson is ""just twenty miles away,"" this primeval world is relocated in a more mythic context, unchanged, Quentin Compson thinks, since ""the first Indian crept into it"" long ago and representing an antithesis to the world of ""houses"" and ""stores"" in towns and cities (192).  When Faulkner's imagination returns to the woods in Ike McCaslin's company in the hunting stories of the late 1930s, they are slightly further away from civilization - ""thirty miles from Jefferson"" (""Delta Autumn,"" 273) - and much more deeply embedded in the realm of the spirit.  When <em>Go Down, Moses</em> pulls these stories together, it uses what Ike learns - from Sam Fathers, his spirit guide, from Old Ben, the bear, and from the wilderness itself - to suggest how he can ""free"" himself from the ""curse"" of history and even time (285, 246).  It's important to note, however, how as a modern American writer Faulkner both evokes and subverts this religious-Romantic trope.  There is always already something awry about the big woods.  Gender isn't transcended, for example, but repressed - ""The Bear"" chapter in the novel actually begins with an act of segregation: ""hunters"" are ""not women, not boys and children,"" but men (182).  Faulkner is aware of this evasion: the novel begins by noting that Ike is childless.  Nor does the wilderness have a future.  In the first paragraph of the story ""Delta Autumn"" the big bottom in Yoknapatawpha is ""gone now"" (267).  It's been clear cut by the logging company that De Spain sold the land to.  Actually, it's not all gone, but the only part of the 'timeless' woods that remains is the graveyard where Sam and Lion and one of Old Ben's paws are buried.  That cemetery strikes a particularly Faulknerian note, but it isn't the most ironic note we need to acknowledge.  Because in the larger world of the Yoknapatawpha fictions, the big woods was <em>already</em> ""Sutpen's Hundred"" (<em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> pre-dates most of the hunting stories, all except ""Lion""), and in that novel De Spain's hunting camp - the place where Ike apparently can step out of history into communion with eternity in a way that resembles Dilsey's religious experience in church on Easter morning in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> - is Sutpen's fishing camp, where Sutpen's life ends.  The ground of Ike's rebirth is saturated with the blood of Sutpen, Wash, Wash's granddaughter Milly and her infant daughter.  ""The past"" was there first.  (In addition to these 7 Big Woods|Big Bottom locations, there are many specific sites within the ""Woods"" that have their own entries in this index: an Ambush Site, a Bayou, a Deer Crossing, and so on.)</p>

Sam Fathers visits the spot with two different boys (he's unnamed in the story and Ike McCaslin in the novel) to release the dogs to hunt foxes or raccoons (203, 162).  More importantly, this elevated spot is a kind of seminary for the boys, with Sam as the spiritual instructor: as Sam talks about the ""old times"" and ""those dead and vanished men of another race"" - the Chickasaw Indians - ""to the boy those old times would cease to be old times and would become part of the boy's present"" (204, 162).

It's fun to speculate whether Faulkner imagined that this is the store in town that belongs to Goodhue Coldfield in <em>Absalom!</em> - the story and the novel were written at the same point in Faulkner's career; Coldfield opened his store in 1828, so it would have been 'there' in 1863 when the story takes place.  There weren't a lot of stores in Jefferson at that early date in the town history and there are a lot of echoes between <em>Absalom!</em> and the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories - each has a Rosa, each has a man shot or shot at at the gate of a plantation, and so on.  But Coldfield had probably already locked up the store and nailed himself into the attic of his house by the time Ringo and Bayard got to town.

Though Quentin's narrative refers to it as a ""farm"" (343), it is unquestionably a plantation, run by a ""manager"" and with ""barns and smokehouses,"" a ""peach orchard,"" and a ""quarters"" where Sam lives with ""the Negroes"" - probably tenant farmers (343, 359).  The narrative says that to get there a wagon has to go up and down several hills, but doesn't say what direction from town it has to travel in.

It was opened in 1863 in Rock Island, Illinois, and became one of the Union Army's largest prisons; by the end of the war, over 12,000 Confederate soldiers had been held there.  The second is the penitentiary in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> where Samuel Worsham Beauchamp is executed in 1940 for killing a Chicago policeman.  Gavin Stevens talks to ""the Warden at Joliet"" and ""an undertaker in Joliet"" about the event (260, 262; 357, 359), and there is a famous prison in Joliet, Illinois, but Faulkner was probably thinking of the nearby Stateville Penitentiary, which was the site of executions by electric chair from 1928 onward.</p>

The textual evidence seems to make it close to certain that Faulkner imagined both white women and both black couples as the same characters, which is how we treat them.  The <em>Moses</em> texts do not identify the place where Hamp and his wife live, but <em>Intruder</em> says that - like Paralee at the Stevenses in <em>Intruder</em> or like  Negro servants in other fictions - the servants live ""in a cabin in the back yard"" behind the big house (74).

It has a ""paintless door,"" and ""the entire house was still lighted by oil lamps and there was no running water in it"" (263, 360-61).

Inside it Mollie Beauchamp, Hamp Worsham, his wife, Belle Worsham, and - at least for a few moments - Gavin Stevens gather in a ""clean, spare bedroom with its unmistakable faint odor of old maidens"" to mourn Samuel Worsham Beauchamp's death (263, 361).  There is a ""hard chair,"" a rocking chair, and a brick hearth in the room (263, 361). In <em>Intruder</em> Eunice Habersham similarly lives in an old house - specifically, a ""columned colonial house"" - ""on the edge of town""; it has ""not been painted since her father died and had neither water nor electricity in it"" (74).

In the Yoknapatawpha fictions it usually is the second kind of 'stand' that is meant.  In either case, it's a safety precaution: when a group is hunting together, as is also the usual practice in Faulkner's fictions, by staying at their 'stands' the hunters know where the other hunters are.  There are many different 'stands' in the hunting stories.  This is the one where Sam Fathers stands with the young hunter in ""Lion,"" ""The Old People"" and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.

On this road, they travel by ""a burned house like ours; three chimneys standing above a mound of ashes"" with a white woman and child ""looking at us from a cabin behind them"" (40, 82).  They continue through a landscape of ""burned houses and gins and thrown down fences"" (40, 82-83) - signs, as Rosa says, that ""the Yankees have already been here"" (40, 82). On our maps the location represents our guess about where, at sunset, they ""drew off the road and camped"" for the night, all three sleeping in the wagon, either in eastern Mississippi or western Alabama (40, 83).</p>

The scene on the southern bank is very chaotic, as a huge crowd of self-emancipated slaves tries to get across the bridge to join the army, while Union troops try to hold them back.  When those soldiers destroy the bridge, the wagon carrying Rosa Millard and her party floats across the river.  On the other bank they are taken to the camp, described by Bayard as ""rows of tents"" (51, 108), and from there to a depot where chests of valuables, captured from Southern plantations, are stacked up in ""a pile that looked higher than a mountain"" (52, 110).  Included in the category of 'contraband' are the former slaves, ""what looked like a thousand"" of them, who have made it across the river; they ""stand and wait"" next to the rope pen holding captured mules (52, 110).</p>

When Faulkner re-tells his story in <em>The Town</em>, the wife with whom he lives in this cabin is ""his fourth"" (16).  The novel adds the detail that this cabin is ""two miles down the railroad track"" (16), which we interpret as putting it in the part of Yoknapatawpha that Faulkner uses the least: the southwest quadrant.  In both texts, Tom-Tom's property includes ""a little piece of corn"" - i.e. a small field - behind the cabin, and a barn that is big enough to contain the ""corn-crib"" where the stolen brass fittings are hidden (156, 159; 21, 29).  In <em>The Town</em> the cabin includes ""the back window"" - the definite article, suggesting there is just one back window, reminds us how small these cabins typically are - which is Turl's way of entering while Tom-Tom is away (25).</p>

A 'bungalow' is a low house, usually just one story, and apparently in Faulkner's mind can be found in various parts of town and occupied by people of widely different social classes.  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, for example, Temple Drake Stevens refers to the residence she and her husband live in as ""a new bungalow on the right [i.e. fashionable] street"" (124).   Flem's bungalow, on the other hand, is in an poor neighborhood where half the little houses are ""inhabited by Negroes,"" and ""scrapped automobiles and tin cans"" litter the yards and ditches (168).  In ""Centaur"" and <em>The Mansion</em> Flem's bungalow is just mentioned, but it's an important site in <em>The Town</em>.  He lives there with his wife Eula and daughter Linda. It's ""a small rented house in a back street near the edge of town"" (9). Behind it is it is a big ditch where Gowan hides ""every afternoon for almost a week"" watching to see if his Uncle Gavin is spying on Mrs. Snopes (55).  The house itself has a ""flimsy porch"" or ""gallery"" on which Flem sits and keeps an eye on the water tank after resigning his post at the power plant (30, 31).  Referred to as ""Mrs. Snopes's house"" and ""Linda's house"" by various narrators, Chick Mallison speculates that Flem must have bought it after he became vice president of the bank ""because they had begun to fix it up.  It was painted now and Mrs. Snopes I reckon had had the wistaria arbor in the side yard fixed up"" and hung the hammock under it (198).  When Gavin Stevens visits Eula he learns that Flem indeed purchased the house four years previously.  It was also Flem who acquired the furnishings from a store in Memphis, paying the owner's wife to select the pieces.  According to Gavin, the house is decorated to be a reproduction of a photograph in ""say <em>Town and Country</em> labeled <em>American Interior</em>"" (231):  ""the coffee, the low table, the two intimate chairs"" that Gavin views as an ""assault not on the glands nor even just the stomach but on the civilised soul which believes it thirsts to be civilised"" (231).</p>

"575","Jefferson Power Plant","","","","","","","<p>The power plant in Oxford is where Faulkner worked as a night superintendent while writing <em>As I Lay Dying</em>.  The power plant in Jefferson is a step forward for Flem Snopes on his path toward wealth and respectability, as described in ""Centaur in Brass"" and <em>The Town</em> and recalled in <em>The Mansion</em>.  When Faulkner first mentions it, in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, he refers to it as the ""light and water plant"" (166), but there's no reference to the 'water' in any later text.  As the ""municipal power plant"" (""Centaur,"" 151), it burns coal to generate electricity.  The job of shoveling coal into the fires is done by Negro ""firemen,"" who are supervised by white men whose job includes making sure that the pressure in the plant's three boilers does not become dangerously high (153) - a job made much harder by Flem's theft of the machinery's brass fixtures during his tenure as manager.  It's likely that almost all the electricity that it produces stays within Jefferson's town limits.  Although according to <em>The Reivers</em> the plant was already in operation by 1905, historically it wasn't until the 1930s and the New Deal's rural electrification program that most of rural Mississippi had power.</p>

As a moment it is obviously connected to that naked human footprint Robinson Crusoe sees on his 'deserted' island and the 'footprint of a great hound' at Baskerville manor that Sherlock Holmes hears about, but Faulkner makes the moment his own when he adds a brilliantly observed and described way to note how very recently The Bear has been on the same spot: ""the warped indentation in the wet ground which while he looked at it continued to fill with water until it was level full and the water began to overflow and the sides of the print began to dissolve away"" (197-98).

"578","Blow-down in Big Woods","","","","","","","<p>This is the spot where the boy hunter sees Old Ben the bear for the second time in ""The Bear"" and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.  A dictionary defines ""blowdown"" as 'a tree or trees that have been blown down by the wind'; Faulkner's narrative describes the spot as a ""corridor where a tornado had passed,"" consisting of a ""tangle of trunks and branches"" (291, 199). Faulkner's description of this ""corridor"" of  natural devastation, which the bear ""rushes through rather than over"" (291, 199), is comparable to the earlier description of the bear's ""corridor of wreckage and destruction"" that started before the boy was born (281, 183).  Even more striking is the way the narrative describes Old Ben moving ""as a locomotive would"" (291, 199) - as he had already done in the earlier passage, where the ""shaggy tremendous shape"" of the bear moves ""with the ruthless and irresistible deliberation of a locomotive"" (281, 183).  We might have expected Faulkner to keep Old Ben and a train further apart, thematically: when later in the novel the logging company lays railroad tracks through the wilderness it isn't long before the world Old Ben represents is completely gone.</p>

It is ""the last little Indian-named town"" (271, 325) on the road to the hunting camp.  The ""town"" is probably a short row of commercial buildings along the road that runs past it, and the local school where the young woman who is Boyd's unnamed lover in ""Delta Autumn"" and Roth's mistress and relative in the novel teaches would have been what the Jim Crow South called a 'Negro' or a 'colored school.'</p>

The place they go to, according to other texts, is the Mississippi Delta, and even in the Delta, over the years they had to keep moving the camp, as more and more land was cleared for agriculture and the wilderness ""retreated southward"" (272, 326).  ""Delta Autumn"" is set at one of these camps.  What the story refers to as ""the ultimate funneling tip"" where the wilderness still exists (272, 326) is probably the point at which the Yazoo River, ""the River of the Dead of the Chocktaws"" (270, 324), joins the Mississippi.  (It is probably the Yazoo that Ike McCaslin helps swim the horses across.)  In this area they are beyond the last cotton fields and farms, surrounded by ""the tangle of brier and cane impenetrable even to sight twenty feet away"" and ""the tall tremendous soaring of oak and gum and ash and hickory that had rang to no axe save the hunter's"" (272, 326).

"599","Borneo","","","","","","","<p>Borneo is a large island nation off the coast of southeast Asia that plays a small and very marginal role in the Yoknapatawpha fictions because of its fabled, not to say stereotypical association with head-hunting.  In <em>Absalom!</em> this connection provides a metaphorical point-of-reference: Clytemnestra's ""body just grew smaller and smaller like something being shrunk in a furnace, like the Bornese do their captured heads"" (175).  That's the only time it was mentioned in the published fictions during Faulkner's lifetime, but when Joseph Blotner edited Faulkner's <em>Uncollected Stories</em> - our source for many of the texts in Digital Yoknapatawpha - he restored to his version of ""Vendee"" a passage from Faulkner's typescript of the story, in which Bayard Sartoris mentions ""a book at home about Borneo"" to explain how he and Ringo knew what to do to skin Grumby and nail his 'hide' to the wall of the cotton compress where he killed Granny (115).  Blotner doesn't explain his reasons for adding it, but since he did, we include it in our database - and although at first it does seem to perpetuate a stereotype of the 'savage,' it's significant that the person who is imitating the practice is Bayard Sartoris, a son of the aristocratic 'civilization' of the Old South.  (""Bornean"" appears as an adjective in ""An Error in Chemistry,"" where the character who calls himself Joel Flint is a former circus performer and carnival worker whose resume includes impersonating a ""Bornean wild man"" in a traveling side show (134); although not rising to the level of a 'Location' in our terms, this third reference may indicate how widespread the cultural fascination with 'Borneo' was - or could be further evidence of a particular predisposition on Faulkner's part.)</p>

Many points inside that circumference are specifically described, and those spots are plotted on our map - though it should be noted that their locations are speculative.

"603","Europe","","","","","","","<p>Faulkner mentions locations in Europe in many texts, sets scenes in various parts of the continent in others, and in two 'Yoknapatawpha fictions' - ""Ad Astra"" and ""All the Dead Pilots"" - sets a whole story there.  But usually he identifies a more or less specific part of the continent: France, say, or Paris, or the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris.  This entry represents the times he refers simply to ""Europe.""  For example, the ""fanlight"" above the front door of Sutpen's mansion in <em>Absalom!</em> was ""imported pane by pane from Europe"" (150).  In ""Delta Autumn"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, as the hunters drive to the Delta and one of the few surviving patches of American wilderness in Mississippi on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II, they discuss the way the ""old-world"" is being engulfed by war (275, 337). Hitler is mentioned (269, 322) and Ike McCaslin reflects on the way the cotton grown on the Delta will be used by Europeans ""to shoot at one another"" (275, 337).  Another instance occurs in ""Smoke,"" where the ""small, curiously chased brass box"" that allows Gavin Stevens to solve the murder is a gift that Miss Emma Dukinfield brought her father ""from Europe"" (25).  Both Europe as a tourist destination and the more fraught world after World War II shape the three times ""Europe"" is mentioned in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>.  But perhaps the most interesting evocation of ""Europe"" occurs in <em>Sanctuary</em>, where twice Horace tells himself that ""when this is over, I'll go to Europe"" (134, see also 260). In fact the novel makes it clear that in the end he goes back to Belle, but the idea that 'Europe' might be a place of sanctuary is an interesting twist on the way so many other inhabitants of Yoknapatawpha see Texas.

This arrangement is similar to the way, for example, Elnora lives behind the Sartoris mansion or Dilsey lives behind the Compson place.  In those cases it is likely that the cabin was originally built for the slaves the white family owned, and was part of a larger slave quarters - as is made explicit in the description of the cabin where Joe Christmas lives behind the Bundren place.   There is no suggestion in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, however, that the Mallison property was ever a working plantation.  Chick Mallison ""had spent a good part of his life"" in that cabin in the back yard (11), eating meals there ""together"" with Paralee's son Aleck (12).

It is one of the earliest buildings in the settlement that hasn't even been named 'Jefferson' yet; ""a century and a quarter later"" - that is, between 1920 and 1930 - it has been replaced by or transformed into ""a garage"" just as horses have been replaced by cars (167).  On the other hand, when <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> begins on a Sunday morning with Chick Mallison standing under a ""shed in front of the closed blacksmith's shop across the street from the jail"" (3), although it is the mid-20th century, there is no suggestion that the shop isn't still open the rest the week.  According to the narrator, this is where a blacksmith ""over a hundred years ago"" hammered out the ""heavy rosette-shaped"" and ""handwrought"" hinges on the jail door (53).  The third Jefferson ""blacksmith shop,"" mentioned in <em>The Town</em>, is located ""on the edge of town""; it is owned by Uncle Noon Gatewood, whom the narrative describes as ""yellow"" - a term which identifies him as a light-skinned Negro, and makes his shop one of the few black-owned businesses mentioned in the fictions (68).  There's an interesting echo here of the story Faulkner only hints at when Ike McCaslin reads through the plantation ledgers in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.  ""Thucydus McCaslin"" is one of the slaves who came to Yoknapatawpha with Carothers McCaslin.  When Old Carothers died in 1837, Thucydus was set free in his will.  But he refused to accept that, or a ""Cash offer"" from Carothers' white sons, choosing instead to stay on the plantation and ""work it out"" - i.e. work until he'd earned enough money to buy himself from the McCaslins (252-53).  That occurred in 1841, at which time Thucydus moved to Jefferson and ""Set Up blacksmith"" (253), which may mean there was a Negro-owned business in town even before the Civil War.</p>

"614","Tenant Farms in Yoknapatawpha","","","","","","","<p>Faulkner's imaginative county never responded to a census, so we cannot say for sure, for example, how many of its farmers owned their own land as opposed to the many who worked as tenant farmers on land that was owned by others - nor can we say with any precision how many of Yoknapatawpha's landless farmers and farm workers were black and how many were white, or how many were 'tenants' or 'sharecroppers' or hired field 'hands' who worked for fixed wages.  <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, for example, refers to all these types (except hired hands) as part of the landscape of Beat Four: ""every tenant and renter and freeholder white or black in the neighborhood"" (18).  But the general pattern seems to be that north of Jefferson, where you find the richest soil is and most of the big plantations, there are large holdings that belong to white landlords (often identifiable as the descendants of slave-owners), and most of their fields are worked by Negroes who are tenants or sharecroppers rather than employees.  <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> makes this clear when Chick Mallison makes two trips along ""the long road"" leading north from Jefferson out to the Edmonds place (143).   On the cold winter morning when Chick makes his first journey, all the men and women on these farms seem to be doing the same thing: preparing to slaughter a hog.  When Chick travels the same road in May four years later, the farm houses are described as ""paintless Negro cabins"" (143), which suggests that the farmers are all or mostly African American tenant farmers.  On this later trip Chick notes the ""fields geometric with furrows"" for planting corn and cotton, but except for one Negro straining to turn the soil with a ""wooden plow"" pulled by a mule, the farms seem deserted as the black population stays out of sight while the county waits for a possible lynching (145).  The earlier story ""Gold Is Not Always"" provides further evidence when in front of the courthouse Lucas Beauchamp, who works on shares at the McCaslin-Edmonds place, sees ""other tenants from their own farm and from other farms along the creek"" (221).</p>

"615","Beat Four Boundary Line","","","","","","","<p>Like real Mississippi counties, Yoknapatawpha is divided into administrative districts called ""beats""; Joel Williamson suggests that that term, with its police background, acknowledges the importance of ""the policing of slaves"" to the state's antebellum white population (<em>William Faulkner and Southern History</em>, 78).  When Lafayette County, the real county on which Faulkner's is based, was created in 1836, it was divided into four beats; later a fifth was formed by sub-dividing Beat 4.  Readers of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> learn that Yoknapatawpha similarly contains five ""beats"" (35).  The novel never makes clear where ""Beat One and Two and Three and Five"" are (194), but notes that the county's northeast quadrant is regularly referred to as ""Beat Four.""  (According to Williamson's account, the southern half of Lafayette is made up of Beats 4 and 5.  In <em>The Mansion</em>, on the other hand, the southeastern quadrant which includes Frenchman's Bend is Beat Two.  That later novel also calls the northeastern part ""Beat Nine,"" though that may be by mistake; see the entry in this index for Beat Nine.) In <em>Intruder</em> the boundary line for Beat Four is specifically ""five miles from town"" at the start of the pine hills to the northeast of Jefferson (91).  Beat Four has a ""constable"" who works for the sheriff's office, but is described as a law unto itself: as one townsman says, ""Hope Hampton might be sheriff in Yoknapatawpha County but he's just another man in Beat Four"" (39).  This ""region of lonely pine hills dotted meagrely with small tilted farms"" is inhabited by ""brawlers and farmers and foxhunters and stock- and timber-traders"" along with ""whiskeymakers"" for whom the hills that make it hard to grow cotton or more corn than a moonshiner needs remind the inhabitants of ""the Scottish highlands"" their ancestors came from (145).  The hills also serve as the ramparts of their ""stronghold against the county and the federal government too"" (35).  The name ""Beat Four"" is a ""synonym for independence and violence"" (35).  According to ""a local wit,"" ""the only stranger ever to enter in [to Beat Four] with impunity was God and He only by daylight and on Sunday"" (35).  After dark, ""strange white men"" passing through stay close to the highway, and ""no Negro"" goes there at all (35).</p>

"619","Caledonia Chapel","","","","","","","<p>""Caledonia"" is the Latin name that the Romans gave northern Britain, and it became a synonym for Scotland. As several of the fictions note, many of the first white settlers in Mississippi of were of Scotch descent, and so it's not surprising to find the name 'Caledonia' in more than one place. There's a real Caledonia in Mississippi: a town in Lowndes County, north of Columbus and near the Alabama border; this town is mentioned in <em>The Unvanquished</em>.   In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> the ""Caledonia Chapel"" is the Protestant church where at least many of the white residents of Beat Four worship.  It is ""a plank steepleless box,"" ""weathered, unpainted, of wood and not much larger than a single room"" (153, 98).  To get there, as Lucas tells Chick, ""you takes the first right hand up into the hills just beyond the Nine-Mile branch bridge"" (67).  The church and graveyard beside it are a mile from the nearest house (90), set ""quite high"" on a ridge (97).  When Chick first looks closely at it, ""standing among the trunks of the high strong constant shaggy pines, solitary but not forlorn"" (153), he decides that while other church buildings signify ""Peace"" or ""Repent"" or even ""Beware,"" ""this one said simply Burn"" (154).  In <em>The Mansion</em> ""Caledonia Chapel"" is only casually mentioned, as the place where Mink Snopes claims he sold his cow to ""the Gowrie boys"" (11).  Here ""Caledonia Chapel"" seems to name more than just a church building, to be the name of a small hamlet.</p>

""Hogs"" are among the products raised on the Mallisons' farm (69), probably for the family's own use rather than commercially; the point of such farms seems to be to give the town's aristocracy a way to stay connected with rural Southern traditions.</p>

"627","Moonshine Still in Frenchman's Bend","","","","","","","<p>Like the rest of Mississippi during Faulkner's lifetime, Yoknapatawpha County is 'dry' - i.e. it is illegal to sell or possess alcoholic beverages there.  But apparently one of the most common uses for the corn that is grown in the hills outside Jefferson is to make moonshine whiskey in the 'stills' that are hidden in various places around the county.  This is the still operated by Wilbur Provine, who supplies the residents of Frenchman's Bend.  According to <em>The Town</em> it is ""located in the creek bottom by a spring about a mile and a half from his house, with a pathway worn smooth as a ribbon and six inches deep from his back door to his spring where he had walked it twice a day for two years until they caught him"" (176).  In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, 'they' is Sheriff Hampton, following up a complaint.

"628","Lonnie Grinnup's Shack|Tent","","","","","","","<p>Over the years some of the antebellum plantation mansions in Yoknapatawpha remain lived in and well-maintained, even enlarged.  Some fall into decay and burn down.  Faulkner describes the decline and fall of Yoknapatawpha's first big planter, the Old Frenchman after whom Frenchman's Bend is named, in two different ways.  His huge house, the Old Frenchman place, begins to fall into decay during or immediately after the Civil War; in <em>Sanctuary</em> it becomes the home of a moonshiner before becoming the site of a series of horrors.  The one descendent of the Old Frenchman, a cognitively challenged man named Lonnie Grinnup, lives instead in a squalid ramshackle hut located ""in almost the exact center of the thousand and more acres his ancestors once owned"" (71).  That's a quotation from the short story ""Hand upon the Waters,"" which describes the hut ""a conical hut with a pointed roof, built partly of mildewed canvas and odd-shaped boards and partly of oil tins hammered out flat. A rusted stovepipe projected crazily above it"" (67-68).  Lonnie is murdered in that story, but his 'home' appears again in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> and <em>The Reivers</em> to remind readers of how regularly Faulkner represents history as a destructive force.  In this last novel it's a tent rather than what <em>Intruder</em> calls ""a half-shed half-den [built] of discarded boards and pieces of flattened stovepipe and tin cans"" (74).</p>

"634","Gettysburg, Pennsylvania","","","","","","","<p>Gettysburg is the site of the largest battle ever fought on American soil, between Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac, commanded at that time by George Meade.  During its three days of fighting, July 1-3, 1863, almost fifty thousand men were killed, wounded or captured.  For many commentators, the Union victory there marked the turning point in the Civil War.  In <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>  the Confederate regiment formed in Yoknapatawpha is there under the command of Thomas Sutpen, though the novel's two references to the battle replace sentimentalities or even military history with irony: at Gettysburg one of the regiment's wagons carries the thousand-pound marble headstones that Sutpen managed to import for his wife's and his own graves in the family cemetery back in Mississippi (154), and Shreve, the Canadian roommate who shares with Quentin Compson the burden of trying to understand the Sutpen story, thinks ""Pickett's charge"" occurred in ""Manassas,"" Virginia (289).  Quentin corrects him.  According to Gavin Stevens (in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>), ""every Southern boy"" - he is thinking, of course, about <em>white</em> boys - remembers ""two oclock on that July afternoon in 1863,"" knows which Confederate generals were there in Gettysburg at the moment when Longstreet reluctanctly gave Pickett the signal to begin that disastrous charge, can't help wondering how the outcome of that battle and the destiny of the South might have been different (199).

"636","Scotland","","","","","","","<p>Much of the white population of Yoknapatawpha is of Scottish descent, from the upper class families like the Compsons and the Mallisons to the folk who live in the ""hill-country of McCallum and Gowrie and Frazier and Muir"" and who brought Scottish words and customs with them ""from Culloden to Carolina, then from Carolina to Yoknapatawpha"" (<em>The Town</em>, 332). So the adjective ""Scotch"" appears in a great many of the fictions.  But three in particular mention Scotland.  Besides <em>The Town</em>, there is the ""Appendix"" that Faulkner wrote to <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, which traces the Scottish roots of the Compson family back to Glasgow, the home of the printer who was Quentin MacLachan Compson's father; Perth, the city in central Scotland where his mother's family lived and where he was brought up after death of both parents; and Culloden Moor, where the Jacobites (including Quentin) were decisively defeated in a battle with Great Britain in 1746.  And in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> one of Gavin Stevens' quasi-racial theories is that the people of Beat Four, ""the Gowries and Ingrums and Workitts"" (28), settled in the hills of northeastern Yoknapatawpha because the landscape reminded them of their origins in ""the Scottish highlands"" (145) - a theory he repeats in <em>The Town</em>.</p>

Five of them apparently still live with their father ""in the twenty-year womanless house"" - ""womanless"" since Amanda Gowrie died in 1926 (214).  What the farm produces is never said, but the narrative provides a glimpse of the interior of the house itself: speculating on the scene in the ""diningroom perhaps"" when the family patriarch pronounces sentence on the fratricide among his sons, the narrator describes ""a lamp burning in the center of the table among the crusted sugarbowls and molasses jugs and ketchup and salt and pepper in the same labeled containers they had come off the store shelf in"" (214).  This all-male family in northeast Yoknapatawpha clearly recalls the MacCallums in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and the McCallums in ""The Tall Men,"" but the Gowries have much rougher edges.  While Chick Mallison learns in the novel to see Nub as a human being capable of grief, there is little suggestion that the Gowries are the kind of family the South and the country can count on to stand up for the right values; the 'family' defines the limits of their loyalties, and even that is contested by the brother who kills his brother.</p>

This cabin, appearing in 8 different texts, is first occupied (in ""Ambuscade"") by Joby and Louvinia, the oldest of the Sartoris slaves and the head of the family that includes Ringo (in <em>The Unvanquished</em>) and Simon (in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>).  During the upheaval brought about by the Civil War, the cabin houses several different combinations of people.  After the Yankees burn down the big house in the story called ""Retreat,"" it is occupied by two members of the Sartoris family, Granny and Bayard (""Raid,"" ""The Unvanquished"").  (According to Bayard's description in ""Raid,"" after the Union army passes through northern Mississippi, the sight of white masters living in slave cabins beside the ashes of burned mansions is a common one.)  After Granny's death, Louvinia and Ringo move back into the cabin, to keep Bayard company (""Vendee,"" ""Skirmish at Sartoris"").  And after the Civil War ends, Bayard's father Colonel John and his cousin Drusilla Hawk also live in it, ""Father and I,"" Bayard writes, ""slept on Ringo's and my pallet and Drusilla slept in the bed . . . where Granny used to sleep"" (""Skirmish,"" 62, 192).  While the whites live there, a ""red quilt [is] nailed by one edge to a rafter and hanging down to make two rooms"" (""Raid,"" 36-37, 78), so we know it's originally a one-room cabin.  When Drusilla's mother shows up at Sartoris, she demands the males move somewhere else.   But while the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories tell the early history of the cabin, Faulkner's earlier fictions describe the last stage in its history.  In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> it (or perhaps another cabin built on the same spot) is occupied by Simon and his family, including his daughter Elnora - who in 1920 work for the Sartorises as servants.  Ten years later it is lived in by Elnora and her children, who turn out to be Sartorises too.  In ""There Was a Queen"" Elnora is acknowledged to be Bayard's half-sister.  New housing arrangements were possible during the chaos of the war, but in its aftermath the bi-racial daughter of Colonel Sartoris remains in a cabin behind the big house her father constructed and - to use a very loaded term - re-constructed.

"651","Sartoris Plantation Other Slave Cabin","","","","","","","<p>A second slave cabin on the Sartoris plantation is mentioned in 4 of the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories.  It is referred to several times as ""the other cabin"" (""Skirmish at Sartoris,"" 62, 192), but even though no other cabins are ever mentioned, there must have been many other cabins in the quarters, given the size and wealth of the plantation.  This other cabin is originally occupied by Loosh and his wife Philadelphy.  It is probably not far from the one lived in by Joby and Louvinia (Loosh's father and mother) - unless you measure the distance politically.  In ""My Grandmother Millard,"" written after the other stories in this series but set earlier in the Civil War, Bayard mentions the ""something"" that happened to Loosh and the ""it"" that he talks about ""more than once, in the cabin"" (669).  ""It"" is his freedom, which puts him at odds with his parents, who remain intensely loyal to the white family that owns them.  When the Union army does pass through Sartoris in ""Retreat,"" Loosh makes Philadelphy go with him in its wake - self-emancipating as many slaves do in other Yoknapatawpha fictions.  Behind them the Yankees leave the Sartoris big house in ashes, so over the course of the later stories Loosh's cabin is inhabited, first, by his parents - who are there because members of the white family that still claims to own them have moved into their cabin; then by Joby and Ringo and Colonel John Sartoris and Bayard - the white males are there because the ladies of Jefferson object to them sleeping in a cabin with Drusilla (""Skirmish at Sartoris"").  For that time being, this cabin is one of the most integrated spaces in Yoknapatawpha - though Bayard's narrative does not mention where Louvinia sleeps during this period.</p>

This is where the Negro tenants who work on the farm live, and their cabins are part of the larger grounds that include ""the barns and smokehouses"" (343).  The term the narrator uses here - ""quarters"" - recalls the layout of a slave plantation (343), and in many ways the economic system of white landlords and black sharecroppers that arose in the South after the Civil War replicates the system of slavery.

"679","Mr. Buffaloe|Bullock's House","","","","","","","<p>Jefferson gets its first automobile in about 1905, about the same time cars began appearing on the American landscape - and about halfway through the long history recorded by the Yoknawpatawpha fictions.  The fictions don't register that event until the last four novels, but it's a sign of Faulkner's increased interest in the larger story of Yoknapatawpha in the last decade of his career that the event is mentioned in <em>all</em> four.  It's also a sign of the way Faulkner kept re-creating and revising 'the larger story of Yoknapatawpha' almost every time he returned to it, as the details of this event change in three of them.  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, the first of those last four novels, Jefferson's first ""gasoline buggy"" is made part by part by an ""ex blacksmith's-apprentice"" in his ""back yard on the edge of town"" (190).  In <em>The Town</em>, the man who makes this ""first automobile"" by hand gets a name, Mr. Buffaloe, and a different job: now he's the city electrician.  The reference to the first car in <em>The Mansion</em> (37) doesn't revise that version of the story, but in Faulkner's last novel, <em>The Reivers</em>, the man gets a new name, Bullock, and his place ""on the edge of town"" is much more elaborately described.  Buffaloe turns one of his outbuildings, which ""would have been a horse- or cow-barn"" on anyone else's property (27), into Jefferson's first ""garage"" (32), and after the mayor passes an ordinance ""against the operation of any mechanically-propelled vehicle inside the corporate limits"" of Jefferson, he turns ""an area of open land behind his house"" into a ""motor drome"" where he can continue to drive the car he built (30).

The Colonel's residence is ""big, with columns and porticoes and formal gardens,"" and the outbuildings include ""stables"" and ""carriage houses"" (274).  In fact, the current tenant farmers live in ""what used to be slave quarters"" (274).  It is not in Yoknapatawpha, but not far away either.  Faulkner often represents the historical fate of the antebellum slave plantations in his world as a dire one - in a number of cases they are decaying or burned down.  The ""old"" in ""old Parsham place,"" for example, evokes the 'old Frenchman place.'  But it's worth noting how the first such plantation to appear in his fiction, the Sartoris place in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, and the last, this one in <em>The Reivers</em>, are both making their white owners wealthy long after the Civil War.</p>

"709","Tallahatchie Crossing|Iron Bridge|Wyott's Crossing|Wyliesport|Wylie's Crossing","","","","","","","<p>This Tallahatchie River crossing has four different labels in the 4 texts it appears in.  In ""My Grandmother Millard,"" set during the Civil War, the ""Crossing"" is probably just a ford, a place where the river is shallow enough to get wagons across (689) - which explains why in 1864 it would have enough military importance to be the site of a battle which, unlike the battle at 'Harrykin Creek' in the story's title, actually took place.    In <em>The Reivers</em>, the iron bridge that spans the Tallahatchie River in 1905 is still new enough to be known in Yoknapatawpha as ""THE Iron Bridge"" (71).  Previously crossing the river meant using the ferry that was first put into service by a man named Wylie, then taken over by Ballenbaugh.  ""Wylie's Crossing"" was ""the only crossing within miles"" for people who wanted to travel into or out of Yoknapatawpha from or to the north, toward Memphis (72).  In <em>The Town</em> it's two decades later and this bridge is at a place called ""Wyott's Crossing."" A passage describing Vaiden Wyott's origins provides the early history of the site: Vaiden's family came from the country, ""where they had owned the nearest ford, crossing, ferry before Jefferson even became Jefferson"" (154).  It's definitely not definite that in Faulkner's imagination these three places are the same place.  Historically, there were two major crossings at the northern boundary of the county, and a good case can be made that Faulkner distinguishes between them.  But if so, the fictions don't make that distinction clear.  For example, commentators have suggested, for good reason, that Faulkner's ""Iron Bridge"" is at the western crossing, where a real iron bridge was built (see for example Charles S. Aiken's map in <em>William Faulkner and the Southern Landscape</em>, 34).  Faulkner says the bridge was built at ""the head of navigation"" for the steamboats that once came upriver eastward from the Mississippi (72), and it the 'Indian stories' the head of navigation is probably upriver from that site - as was the historical skirmish between Forrest's Confederate troops and the Yankees, which Faulkner appropriates for ""My Grandmother.""  What is important is that Faulkner's various texts describe the way this crossing (or these crossings) linked Jefferson to the larger world, and that the fictions represent how the ford becomes a ferry becomes an iron bridge as time passes.</p>

It was a major port on the Mississippi River, and the capital of the Mississippi Territory.  The first fact accounts for the fictional way in ""A Courtship"" Natchez is the the home port of Captain Studenmare's steamboat.

Travel between Nashville and the nascent Jefferson was along the Natchez Trace, a 440-mile forest trail between the Mississippi and Cumberland Rivers created and used by the Indians before the coming of European settlers.  In their turn, many of those settlers came to the Mississippi Territory along that same trail.  When ""A Courtship"" locates Yoknapatawpha using the phrase ""between Natchez and Nashville,"" it is a reference to this early route through the wilderness (365).  ""A Name for the City"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> also indicate how Nashville was the point of contact between the settlers in Yoknapatawpha and the larger world, including the federal government which pays ""a special horseman"" to carry the mail ""every two weeks"" from ""the post office in Nashville"" (6, 202).

The river is shallow, and risky for steamboats to navigate.  ""A Courtship"" describes how laboriously they had to travel even when the water was ""tall enough"" - i.e. deep enough (366).  In the earliest 'Indian stories' - ""Red Leaves"" and ""A Justice"" - a relic of this mode of travel sits some distance from the water as part of the 'big house' of an Indian chief.  But while it seems in those early stories that this steamboat, stranded on a sand bar and abandoned to the ambitious chief's re-purposing, was the last one to try getting to Yoknapatawpha, later fictions have steamboats using the landing as late as the 1830s.  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, at least, the land at the landing is owned by Thomas Sutpen when the marble columns which the town imported from Italy for the new courthouse are unloaded there.</p>

Both many Yoknapatawpha men and Faulkner's fictions go there frequently.  In <em>The Reivers</em> Lucius Priest refers to this area as ""the Memphis tenderloin"" (223); the original 'Tenderloin district' was in 19th century New York City, but the name soon became a popular nickname for areas in other U.S. cities that offered various kinds of vice.  I don't think Faulkner ever uses the phrase 'red light district,' which is associated with the specific vice of prostitution. (In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, however, he does note that one of the characters was expelled from the state university for hanging a red light ""above the door of the girls' dormitory,"" 186).  In ""Uncle Willy,"" Willy Christian finds the prostitute he marries (briefly) in this part of Memphis, on ""Manuel Street"" (237).  There is no such street in the real Memphis, but there is a 'Gayoso Street' that ran through the center of the red light district, and Gayoso Street is named after Manuel Gayoso, a former governor of Spanish New Orleans.  In <em>Sanctuary</em> Popeye taunts Ruby Lamar with her ""Manuel Street"" background (9).  ""Gayoso"" street, along with the nearby ""Beale"" street, are both mentioned by Jason Compson in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, when he thinks about how small is the dress worn by his niece Quentin (232); Jason seems very familiar with this part of Memphis, and Lorraine, the Memphis woman he has a relationship with, probably works in a brothel in the area. Late on a Sunday, at least in <em>The Reivers</em>, the area is very quiet, but walking both to and from the train station, Lucius recognizes ""places similar to Miss Reba's"" as well as closed ""saloons"" along their route (137).</p>

"729","Road between Jefferson and Oxford","","","","","","","<p>The road between Oxford and Jefferson really runs between Faulkner's experience and his fiction, but it is also traveled frequently by a number of characters <em>in</em> that fiction.  In <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> for example, Henry Sutpen and Charles Bon make a number of trips between Sutpen's Hundred and the college they attend in Oxford.  Only two texts, however, actually include events that take place in the space between the real Oxford and the imagined Yoknapatawpha.   In Faulkner's first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Bayard Sartoris drives his fast car up to the unnamed ""college"" town north of Jefferson; he drives even faster on the return trip, scaring the three Negroes in the back seat. The road runs between and over a series of hills.  Alongside the road ""sparse negro cabins squat on the slopes,"" surrounded by ""warped farmed implements,"" huddled in ""the shiftless fashion of negroes"" (145).  In the trip Bayard's grandfather (also named Bayard) makes back to Jefferson from the university in Oxford in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, he and Ringo travel this ""long road"" together, riding horses side-by-side for forty miles to get to Sartoris (217); this is about a decade later in Faulkner's career, but half a century earlier in historical time.  It might be interesting to speculate on why in all three of these examples the upper-class white characters travel in company with characters of color.  In any case, no matter when or how characters travel between these two worlds, Faulkner never tells us very clearly how one gets to Jefferson from Oxford, or vice versa.</p>

In the novel, the original slave quarters is implicitly there (though no longer in use) when after the death their father, Uncle Buck and Uncle Buddy McCaslin move all the slaves into the big house their father built for himself.  If this represents a form of progress, however, it is temporary.  After Emancipation the quarters are occupied again by the Negro tenant farmers who continue to work on the plantation into the 20th century.  In ""Pantaloon in Black"" the cabin Rider rents from Roth Edmonds is ""the last one in the lane"" (131) - a phrase that clearly implies the grouping of cabins that is made explicit in the next chapter, ""The Old People,"" which notes that Sam Fathers lives for years ""among the negroes"" in ""a cabin among the other cabins in the quarters"" (161).  Faulkner had already written a version of this last line twice before, in ""A Justice,"" where Sam lives in the ""quarters"" on the Compson farm, and in ""The Old People"" as a short story, which does not give a name to the white family that Sam and the other people in the ""quarters"" work for.

Edmonds clearly owns the stable, and in the second two texts Faulkner makes it clear that Edmonds also owns the mules stabled inside it.   In the magazine version of ""Point of Law,"" however, it is possible that his tenants own their own livestock: the narrative calls the mule with which Lucas works the corn and cotton fields ""his"" (218), and the ""fat middle-aged mare"" that George harnesses in the stable is identified as ""Lucas'"" (223).  George also has a mule that is housed in the stable.  In cultural and economic terms the distinction is a major one.  A 'tenant farmer' owns his own lifestock, and usually contracts to give a landlord a quarter to a third of his crop for the use of the land.  A 'sharecropper' has to use the landlord's livestock and tools as well as his land, and has to pay a greater share of the crop at the end of the harvest.  Faulkner, however, seems to use the terms interchangeably, so it may not matter to him whether Lucas or George own any of the animals in Edmonds' stable.</p>

The deputy sheriff who finds it calls the hiding place ""a brier brake in the creek bottom"" (217).  (A ""brake"" in this usage is a place overgrown with one particular kind of vegetation.)  In the revised version of the story that Faulkner includes in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Lucas tries to hide his still in one of the mounds built by the aboriginal inhabitants of northern Mississippi. This mound is described as ""squat, flat-topped, almost symmetrical"" (37). It rises out of the flat valley four miles away from Edmonds' house. There are a number of 'Indian mounds' in Mississippi and elsewhere along the rivers. The indigenous peoples of the Americas constructed them for religious and ceremonial, burial, and residential purposes. The mound in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> once attracted a team of archaeologists who conducted a dig around it.  We don't know what they found, but when Lucas digs into the mound in the dark, he is struck by something that the narrative calls an ""admonitory pat from the spirit of darkness and solitude, the old earth, perhaps the old ancestors themselves"" and somehow given ""a single coin"" that he ""knows"" is gold (38).  With this beginning the story could be heading in a number of different directions; in the event, it's a comedy.  The old earth seems to be playing the same trick on Lucas - 'salting' the ground to make someone believe there's treasure in it - that Lucas plays on a white man in the story.  Faulkner has described this scam before, in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  Yet despite the metaphorical ""jeering and prolonged laughter"" that lurks in this episode (38), I can't help but wonder if there isn't a kind of self-reflexive aspect to it.  Faulkner himself found 'Yoknapatawpha' by digging so brilliantly into the 'postage stamp of [his] native soil' - although given how broke he was at the time he was composing <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, he might have wondered if he too was being conned.

The description implies the existence of the other cabins along the lane, and so evokes the configuration of the antebellum plantation with its quarters for the enslaved workers.  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, ""Pantaloon in Black"" appears as the chapter immediately before ""The Old People,"" and in that next story the narrator explicitly calls the cabin on the Edmonds' place where Sam Fathers lives (presumably also on this lane) ""a cabin among the other cabins in the quarters"" (161).  So in the Locations for the novel version of ""Pantaloon"" we move the entry for the lane where Rider and Mannie live into an entry for the 'Quarters on McCaslin-Edmonds Plantation.'  But since the word 'quarters' does not appear in the magazine version of story, we created this separate entry for the lane as a Location in that text.  For some readers of the short story the word ""lane"" might have been enough to evoke the larger quarters and the longer history of white-black relations in Faulkner's South, but it's not clear that Faulkner intends to create that set of associations in this story.  When he moves the story into its place in the novel, that set of associations is much more clearly established.</p>

Faulkner wrote the short story about a hapless farmer named Pap about half a decade before he decided, while writing <em>The Hamlet</em>, to make it part of the backstory of Ab Snopes.  While the map coordinates we assign this bridge keep it three miles away from town in both texts, we have to move it from the road Pap takes in ""Fool"" to the different road Ab Snopes takes in the novel - Pap lives in Frenchman's Bend; at that point in his life Ab definitely does not.

Faulkner hardly ever is troubled by this kind of discrepancy, but we had to pick a direction, so for several reasons we chose the east.

"770","Road to Old Frenchman Place","","","","","","","<p>Faulkner describes the road that leads from the main road to the Old Frenchman place in both ""Lizard's in Jamshyd's Courtyard"" and <em>The Hamlet</em>.  In both texts the episode that the road figures in is the same: Flem Snopes conning V.K. Suratt (""Lizards"") or V.K. Ratliff (<em>Hamlet</em>) and two local residents of Frenchman's Bend into believing there's buried treasure on the old plantation.  The short story describes the ""old road"" first.  ""For almost sixty years"" it has not been used, and is ""so peaceful"" that entering it from ""the broad valley highway"" feels like ""another world""; the bridge that once crossed the ""branch""- i.e. the stream - has ""vanished"" (135).  The novel includes the same physical details.  It is ""hardly a road"" now, and there remains ""no trace"" of the bridge that had crossed the creek decades earlier, when the place was a prosperous ante bellum plantation (373).  But in the novel the road also leads into a resonant evocation of the Old South, ""women . . . in hooped crinoline"" and ""men in broadcloth"" riding carriages over the road, the ""courier"" who carried news about the attack on Fort Sumter up it, ""the son and perhaps the master himself"" who ride  off to fight the Civil War down it; the ""Federal patrols"" who travel it ""about the time of the battle of Jefferson"" (373).  Despite the mention of ""a neighbor's slave,"" ""a body-servant"" and ""negro slaves,"" the passage seems nostalgic for that lost time, although it also describes the road in the novel's present as an ""old scar almost healed now,"" as nature reclaims the landscape (373).</p>

"773","Frenchman's Bend Church","","","","","","","<p>A Frenchman's Bend church appears in seven-and-a-half different texts.  The population of the Bend is probably big enough and at least nominally religious enough to fill more than one church on Sunday mornings, but the narrator of <em>The Hamlet</em> says ""the church"" in the description of the Bend, as if there is only one (31).  On the other hand, <em>The Mansion</em> refers explicitly to the ""Baptist church"" in the Bend (334); we know that Clarence Snopes, who attends it, calls himself a Baptist, but the novel also mentions the local ""revival leader"" Wesley Snopes, and 'Wesley' is a very Methodist name.  We can safely assume that however many churches might be in this part of Yoknapatawpha, they are all Protestant, and either Baptist, Methodist or Presbyterian.  And the larger textual pattern suggests that if Faulkner imagined <em>a</em> church in the Bend, he moved it around more than once.  In <em>The Hamlet</em>, when Mrs. Armstid looks ""up the road"" from Varner's store, she sees (in this order) Mrs. Littlejohn's, the school, and then, the church (349).  That location puts it on the road that leads to Jefferson.  On the other hand, ""Hand upon the Waters"" puts the ""white-painted and steepleless"" church beside the graveyard where Lonnie Grinnup is buried on the dirt lane road that leads ""back toward the hills"" (75).  On the whole it seems that the church mentioned in the Snopes trilogy and ""By the People"" is most likely a Baptist church that is located where Mrs. Armstid saw the church and the churchyard, with its ""gleam of marble headstones"" (349).  The evidence suggests that this is the church that Mrs. Varner - the wife of the man who owns most of the Bend - treats as part of the Varner fiefdom, hiring the ministers herself and ""firing them too when they didn't suit her"" (<em>The Town</em>, 306).  Again following the probabilities, the textual evidence suggests that the church where Grinnup is buried is also the church that Reverend Whitfield presides over in <em>As I Lay Dying</em> and ""Shingles for the Lord.""  Addie Bundren begins her affair with Whitfield at a camp meeting, and although 'camp meetings' were held by other Protestant denominations, historically this form of worship was most associated with Methodism, which brings us back to Wesley Snopes and revivals.   ""Shingles"" describes Whitfield's church in the most detail, as a physical and a spiritual structure.  The young narrator of that story lists Armstids, Tulls, Bookwrights, Quicks, Snopeses and Griers as the families that ""belonged to that church and used it to be born and marry and die from"" (41).  Materially, it is one-room and ""old,"" built from wood ""long dried out,"" and ""full of old colored-picture charts that Whitfield had accumulated for more than fifty years"" (40).  It burns quickly.  But there is also, the story's narrator decides, something about the church and the preacher and the small community's commitment to it that can be described with words like ""indestructibility, endurability"" (42).  Although the naivete of the narrator certainly provides room for the possibility of irony, the destruction of this church gives rise to what may be the Yoknapatawpha fictions' highest tribute to institutional religion and the communal role it plays.   Then there's the 'half' church in the Bend: that is, the ""churchyard"" where Ellie Pritchel Flint is buried in ""An Error in Chemistry"" (124).  That story doesn't say anything at all about the church associated with this church-yard, hence the 'half': we know there must be a church there, but it's even harder than usual to say where.  So rather than try to impose a definitive structure of our own upon these 8 references, we have created this one aggregate entry; it comes with the caveat that there may be several 'Frenchman's Bend Churches,' and that we can only say for sure that at least one of them is a Baptist church, though there is reason to assume a Methodist church is there too.  It's important to note that, however many churches there might be in the Bend, the only time the fictions ever take us inside one is when the narrator of ""Shingles,"" right after the church itself burns to the ground, remembers how ""during church and Sunday school"" he used to stare at ""the old long nightshirt"" Whitfield wore ""to baptize in"" as it hung on a special nail (40).</p>

"774","Whiteleaf","","","","","","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> ""Whiteleaf"" is the name of a creek, a hamlet and a store.  There is good reason to think that when he created these locations Faulkner was thinking of the real Yellow Leaf creek, which flows through the southeast corner of Lafayette County into the Yocona River, but even better reason to think that, as was invariably the case, he was willing to shift real places around to suit the imaginative needs of a particular story.  The novel's best cue to the various Whiteleaf locations comes when the sheriff asks about another way to Jefferson from Mink Snopes' place, and a deputy tells him that the ""old Whiteleaf Bridge road"" is fourteen miles away, that when they get to that road they are ""nine miles from Whiteleaf store"" and when they get to the store they are still ""eight miles from Jefferson"" (pp 282-83).  Much of the route ""winds among the pines hills,"" but the village store sits ""in the long broad rich flatlands"" under cultivation (283).  The store is also described as eight miles from Frenchman's Bend when it becomes the original venue of the two civil suits at the end of the novel (356).  Our placements try to take these distances into account, though all are essentially informed speculation.  (And we confess that we cannot find a way to reconcile this group of 'Whiteleaf' Locations with the mention of 'Whiteleaf' in connection with a creek in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>; that has a separate entry in the index.)  The store seems to be a typical crossroads country store.  It is too small to hold all the people who attend the trials, which take place instead in ""the locust grove beside the store"" (356).  Whiteleaf may also be the location of the ""schoolhouse about eight miles away"" where Eula goes to a dance (147).  Whiteleaf is mentioned again in <em>The Town</em>, but only as the place in the county Grover Cleveland Winbush's mother lives.</p>

"778","Jack|Zack Houston's Land","","","","","","","<p>Although Faulkner changes Houston's first name between texts, he describes Houston's farm essentially the same way in all 4 of them. <em>The Hamlet</em> goes into the most detail about it.  There it is located in ""the hills,"" at least ""a mile"" away from the ""rich, broad, flat river-bottom country"" where the hamlet sits (190).   Houston grew up there, in his parents' ""old pre-Civil War house"" - described ""too big for three"" people, but ""no mansion, owning no columns"" (237).  After an absence from Yoknapatawpha he returns to marry, building a ""new house on a new site nearer the road"" (238).  His property includes a milking-shed, a stable, and the pasture with a creek and a ravine in it where Mink Snopes' calf spends a winter.  This is also the pasture where Ike Snopes lies in the dew amid ""the waking life of grasses and listens for her approach"" (182).  'She' is a cow, and Ike's affair with 'her' turns the pasture into a different kind of place, somewhere between idyll and pornography, the romantic and the grotesque.  To get back to the Houston's farm: the other three texts all agree that Houston owns it, and that it's prosperous.</p>

From other Faulkner fictions, however, we know that the 'Old Frenchman' was Louis Grenier, one of the first white inhabitants of Yoknapatawpha.  Before the Civil War his 'place' was one of the county's largest slave plantations, and the people who died at there when it was a working plantation were buried in a cemetery that lies ""on a smaller knoll"" than the mansion house and ""four hundred yards"" away from it (""Lizards,"" 136).  Their ""weathered and illegible headstones"" remain (136).  Apparently these people included Grenier's slaves, since the both texts say that ""the progenitors of saxophone players in Harlem honky-tonks"" lie there along with the kinfolks of the Old Frenchman (136).

The ""Appendix"" also mentions the Civil War battle that was fought at Resaca, Georgia, over three days in May, 1864, during the Union Army's campaign to capture Atlanta.  The Compson at that battle was Confederate General Quentin Compson; he ""failed"" there, ""though not so badly"" as he had earlier at Shiloh in neighboring Tennessee (329).  General Johnston, the Confederate retreat through Georgia and the Atlanta battles are also briefly mentioned in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.  During the Civil War, Atlanta was an important railroad center for the South, which provides the background to the war story Drusilla tells Bayard and Ringo in ""Raid"" and <em>The Unvanquished</em> about the daring Confederate raid to liberate a locomotive from the Yankees after Atlanta had fallen (97; see ""Atlanta"" in this index).  Confusingly, Drusilla tells this story well before the campaign to capture Atlanta has begun - but it has to be acknowledged that while Faulkner was a student of history, including Civil War history, he scrambles the events of the war in more than one text.  For example, in the magazine version of ""Ambuscade,"" Bayard mentions hearing about two battles - ""Chickamauga and Lookout Mountain"" - from his father in July 1863 (5), but the battles were not fought until September and November, respectively, of that year.

"820","Frenchman's Bend Blacksmith","","","","","","","<p>The first time the Frenchman's Bend blacksmith shop appears in a fiction is when Byron Snopes is fleeing Yoknapatawpha after robbing the bank in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  The date of the novel is 1929; the date of the event in the novel is 1919.  Byron grew up in the Bend, but notes a change as he drives past it: the ""blacksmith shop"" is now also ""a garage,"" ""with a gasoline pump"" (278).  The blacksmith shop is mentioned again in the first two volumes of the Snopes trilogy.  <em>The Hamlet</em> was published in 1940.  According to its chronology, a man named Trumbull has been the blacksmith in the Bend for ""almost twenty years"" when he's dispossessed by Snopeses in 1896 or so (69).  In <em>The Town</em>, however, published in 1957, the same dispossession takes place about a decade later, and after Trumbull has been the smith ""man and boy for fifty years"" (38).  While the transition from blacksmith to garage mechanic is a sign of how the world moves forward, the way these events move forward and backward and sometimes both at the same time is a sign of how time often behaves in Faulkner's world.</p>

Both Flem and Eula work in the restaurant for a while, but it isn't long before Flem acquires the other half from Ratliff's co-owner Grover Winbush, and brings additional Snopeses in from Frenchman's Bend to run it.  One of these is Eck Snopes, who in <em>The Town</em> ""fries on the crusted grill the eggs and meat"" until he is fired for admitting that he ""dont know jest what this is"" in the hamburger he's cooking, ""but it aint no beef"" (34).  That grisly detail gives us a clear enough idea of what kind of restaurant it is.  According to several texts, most of the people eating at its long counter are ""country folk"" (<em>Flags in the Dust</em>, 166), but it is possible that this is also the restaurant ""on a side street"" that Joe Christmas eats at in <em>Light in August</em> (113).</p>

Most of the details of the killer's three different attempts over several different days and nights to hide the body are the same: he first puts the corpse under a brush pile deep in a thicket, but the baying of Houston's hound compels him to stash it inside a hollow tree stump; when that doesn't quiet the dog, he throws the decaying body into the river.  In the earlier tale, the tree is ""a rotting cypress shell, topless, about ten feet tall"" (""Hound,"" 155); in the revised version it is ""the shell of a once-tremendous pin oak, topless and about ten feet tall"" (<em>Hamlet</em>, 249-50).

In the local vernacular, a ""bottom"" refers to the landscape around a creek or small river.  It is usually dense with brush, vines and small trees.

In the Yoknapatawpha fictions it usually is the second kind of 'stand' that is meant.  In either case, it's a safety precaution: when a group is hunting together, as is also the usual case in Faulkner's fictions, by staying at their 'stands' the hunters know where the other hunters are.

"838","Logging Company Railroad","","","","","","","<p>Just as the theme of environmental destruction becomes more prominent in Faulkner's hunting fictions between ""A Bear Hunt"" and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, so does the textual presence of the railroad train that runs through the big woods. ""A Bear Hunt"" refers to it as a ""log train"" (187). In ""Lion"" Quentin calls it ""the dummy line"" (69). In <em>Moses</em> it's called a ""spur-line"" (306).  But by any name this is a temporary set of railroad tracks which the timber company lays down through the woods to make it easier to haul the cut trees out of the woods and to the sawmill.  In the first story the hunters set up their stands ""along the log-line levee"" (69), which presumably is an earthen dyke that has been built to keep the tracks from being flooded when the river rises, though it could instead be the raised and flattened bed on which the track itself runs (69). In both the other two stories two of the hunters - Quentin and Boon in ""Lion,"" Ike and Boon in <em>Moses</em> - use the train to travel from the hunting camp to the main railroad line, which takes them to Memphis.  In the novel, in final section of ""The Bear,"" Ike reflects at length on the history of this line, how ""harmless"" it seemed when it was first built through the ""unaxed wilderness"" (304) - ""the diminutive locomotive and its shrill peanut-parcher whistle"" (304) - and how ominous it seems as the company prepares to carry almost the entire woods away on it.</p>

"839","Hoke's Sawmill and Commissary","","","","","","","<p>""Hoke's"" is first described in ""Lion"" as ""the little town on the edge of Major de Spain's preserve"" (185), though ""town"" seems like an overstatement when Quentin later says ""Hoke's was just a sawmill and a few stores"" (188).  Its population is probably mostly male, and its economy based entirely on logging.  It is where the temporary logging train that runs through the woods intersects the main railroad that runs to Memphis.  It sounds like one of the short-lived communities that in other fictions Faulkner describes as springing up around sawmills that themselves are located close enough to a forest and a railroad to take logs from the one and ship lumber elsewhere on the other (see the entry for Doane's Mill in this index). Much of this description is repeated when Faulkner interpolates the story of Lion into ""The Bear"" section of <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, but when Ike McCaslin pays a second visit to Hoke's at the end of ""The Bear,"" after De Spain has sold the timber rights to the woods, it has grown dramatically: ""a new planing-mill . . . and what looked like miles and miles of stacked steel rails . . . feeding troughs for two hundred mules,"" and the other signs of what some would call progress but which leaves Ike ""shocked and grieved"" (302).  It is all probably still temporary, but now it's clear that when Hoke's is gone, the big woods will be too.</p>

It isn't described, but it seems that a ""log drift"" is a kind of natural bridge across the river.  The most likely such 'bridge' would be a tree that fell on one bank that was tall enough to reach the other side, but in that case why would Faulkner use the word 'drift'?  So perhaps a 'log drift' is a collection of fallen tree trunks that the current has carried to a spot where they create a literal 'log jam.'  When Faulkner retells this part of the story of the bear in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, he puts something else called ""Coon bridge"" in the same spot, again without describing it (231).  The capital ""C"" suggests something permanent enough to have a proper name - perhaps a rude bridge made of logs somehow fixed together.  In any case, we are treating it as the same location, even if Faulkner imagined differences between the 'drift' and the 'bridge.'</p>

In the novel, where it's Ike McCaslin who visits De Spain, this office is described in more detail.  It is a ""big, airy, book-lined second-storey room with windows at one end opening upon the shabby hinder purlieus of stores and at the other a door giving onto the railed balcony above the Square"" (301).  Its furnishings include ""a wicker-covered demijohn of whiskey"" and a ""bamboo-and-paper punkah [fan]"" kept swinging back and forth over the Major's desk by ""old Ash,"" the Negro servant who sits ""in a tilted chair beside the entrance pulling the cord"" (301).</p>

"849","Lion's|Sam Fathers' Gravesite","Context (text, as interpreted)","<p>Deep in the big woods is the holly knoll where Lion lies buried at the end of the short story bearing his name.  When Quentin visits the site he notes the ""pale trunks"" of the four holly trees that mark the four corners of the graveyard, and the ""wooden cross with Old Ben's mutilated paw nailed to it"" that marks the dog's resting place (""Lion,"" 199).  Half a dozen years later Faulkner's imagination returns to this knoll, this time at the end of ""The Bear"" in the novel <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.  This time it is Ike McCaslin who visits the site, which now also contains the remains of Sam Fathers.  Among the several differences between the two scenes, this one may be the most portentous: now the burial site is defined by ""four concrete markers set down by the lumber company's surveyor to establish the four corners of the plot which Major de Spain had reserved out of the sale"" (<em>Moses</em>, 311). Soon that lumber company will have cut down all the woods except for this one plot.  Visiting the knoll, Ike thinks of nature's immortality: ""that place where dissolution itself was a seething turmoil of ejaculation tumescence conception and birth"" (311); imagining Sam, Lion and Ben reunited beyond the grave in something like the stereotypical 'happy hunting ground' of Indian mythology, Ike concludes that the knoll is ""no abode of the dead because there was no death"" (312).  But as signs of things to come - and go - those ""shockingly alien"" concrete markers transform all that will be left of the big woods into the grave of the wilderness itself.

In ""Lion"" the spot is marked by ""four pale trunks"" of holly trees, and is where the dog Lion was buried under a ""wooden cross with Old Ben's dried mutilated paw nailed to it"" (""Lion,"" 199).  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, however, both the contents and the context of the site are more resonant.  Now the spot is identified by four concrete markers, and alongside Lion and ""Old Ben's dried mutilated paw"" lie the remains of Sam Fathers, the last of the Chickasaw Indians in Yoknapatawpha (312).  And now the narrative identifies the spot as the one plot of land that Major de Spain reserved when he sold the rest of his hunting grounds to the lumber company that is planning to turn the trees into boards.  In Faulkner's hunting stories, the big woods may at first seem boundless and eternal.  Although the thought doesn't overtly occur to Ike during his visit to the gravesite in the last section of ""The Bear,"" as he stands inside this plot to pay his respects it is inevitable that soon all that will remain those big woods is this small cemetery.</p>

In the first novel he also uses it to represent the many other tenant farms where Mink has lived and worked over the years.  For instance, the novel refers to him seeing his children ""across whatever sorry field or patch"" he happens to be farming and sitting on ""whatever rented porch"" resting from his labor (264).  The farm he's sharecropping when he kills Houston is described similarly in both texts.  <em>The Hamlet</em> calls it ""a broken-backed cabin"" off a ""narrow road back in the hills"" (80), four miles from Frenchman's Bend (268).  The cabin is laid out as a 'dogtrot cabin': a ""paintless two-room cabin with an open hallway between and a leanto kitchen"" (243).  Mink put his name in ""crude lettering"" on the ""battered and scarred mailbox"" in front of the ""foul muck-trodden lot"" (80-81), but in fact the land he farms as a share cropper is ""a foreclosed portion of Houston's farm"" (275) that now, like so much else in the Bend, is owned by Will Varner. <em>The Mansion</em> locates the ""paintless repairless tenant cabin"" (10) where Mink lives in the context of other tenant farms in the hill country around Frenchman's Bend: ""a section of small worn-out farms tilted and precarious among the eroded folds like scraps of paper"" (458).  And this novel re-visits the farm after almost forty years, when Mink returns to it after killing Flem: all that remains of the cabin is ""part of the roof,"" parts of the walls, and ""a hole in the ground"" - what was once the cellar - which is where Mink looks for refuge (459).</p>

"861","Tenant Farm on Holland's Land","","","","","","","<p>This is one of the several pieces of un-real estate in Yoknapatawpha that Faulkner moves around to fit the needs of different stories.  In ""Fool about a Horse,"" the unnamed family of the narrator lives in Frenchman's Bend, on a farm at some distance beyond Varner's store.  Although the story does not explicitly say so, it seems likely that the family are tenant farmers and the farm itself belongs to ""Old Man Anse Holland,"" given the way the narrator's Pap freely uses Holland's property - ""bob-wire and busted tools"" and so on (118) - to make horse trades, and tries to ""borrow a mule"" from Holland when he loses his own (134).  Nor does the text provide much detail about the house they live in, though we know it has a ""kitchen"" (134) and a ""gallery,"" or porch (133).  They grow cotton on the field referred to as ""the lower piece"" (134), a phrase that implies another field where corn is grown. The text also mentions the fenced ""lot"" (119), the ""well"" (120) and the ""stable"" (133) that are also part of the property.  There is no mention of a cow.  Later Faulkner decided to re-tell this story as part of Ab Snopes' biography in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  In the novel Ab could not have lived in Frenchman's Bend prior to his arrival there on page 8, so Faulkner relocates Old Man Anse Holland's property away from the Bend to a place described as fourteen miles from Jefferson.  To get to town Ab has to travel up a number of hills and through the hamlet of Whiteleaf (cf. 35), details which inform our speculation about where in the county it now lies.

"864","Varner Sharecropper Cabin","","","","","","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> the ""sagging broken-backed cabin"" where Ab and his family begin working as tenant farmers for the Varners is a grim place: the porch is ""sagging and stepless,"" the windows are ""sashless,"" and the yard is ""littered with rubbish - the ashes, shards of pottery and tin cans - of its last tenants"" (22).  The brief description of the place in <em>The Town</em> focuses on the larger farm around it: ""It was a farm so poor and small and already wornout that only the most trifling farmer would undertake it, and even they stayed only one year"" (5).  This of course is the world that Ab's son Flem was born into.  Much later in <em>The Town</em>, and in a very different context, Flem's wife Eula warns Gavin Stevens that ""you've got to be careful or you'll have to pity"" Flem (347).  By showing readers the incredibly bleak life that Flem had as the son of a Southern tenant farmer, Faulkner does make it impossible, at least, not to sympathize with the fierceness of his desire to escape it.</p>

As the novel's narrator puts it, the white man who runs the camp ""through political influence or bribery or whatever got his convict labor from the State for the price of their board and keep"" (262); the prisoners themselves are not compensated for the work they do cutting down the trees.  This location also includes the ""nearest county seat"" where Mink gets married (264).  In <em>The Mansion</em> this camp is referred to - briefly, and with a degree of irony that is hard to determine - as the setting in which Mink Snopes touches his wife ""that first time with amazement and reverence and incredulous excitement the night of his marriage"" (100).

Although the fictions don't always make the distinction explicit, in at least three texts Faulkner shows federal criminal cases being tried or handled in the federal courthouse.  Making or selling moonshine is the federal crime in ""A Point of Law"" and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, because it evades the federal excise tax on distilled alcohol; pornography is the federal crime in <em>The Town</em>, because Montgomery Ward Snopes can be accused of using the federal mail to distribute it.</p>

As an example of what is changed besides a place on the map, here's how Pap's son describes his exasperated mother's reaction to the trade her husband makes: at least it's a  good sign that the horse ""could git up and walk from Beasley Kemp's lot to ourn by itself"" (119).

"883","Anse Holland's Place","","","","","","","<p>Although ""Fool about a Horse"" and the re-told story about trading horses with Pat Stamper in <em>The Hamlet</em> have different protagonists and different first-person narrators, in both the farmer who lives within walking distance of the protagonist is ""Old Man Anse Holland""  (118, 33).  Old Anse is clearly wealthier than most of the farmers in the area.  In the short story it is implied that the protagonist, Pap, is a tenant on a farm Holland owns; in the novel that is made explicit.  While the two texts locate the farm in different parts of the county, they are essentially the same place.  Whether they are the same as the place owned by <em>Anselm</em> Holland in ""Smoke"" is a question we can't answer.  ""Smoke"" was published in 1932, just four years before ""Fool about a Horse,"" and some commentators assume that Anselm Sr. and Anse are the same character, but others don't.

Their ""home"" is a tenant farm in the Bend.  The second time Faulkner tells the story, however, in <em>The Hamlet</em>, the role of Pap is played by Ab Snopes, and at that point in his life Ab cannot live in Frenchman's Bend (where his first arrival in that area takes place <em>after</em> the misadventure with Stamper).  Because in the novel he lives in a different part of the county, the ""old barn"" has to be on a different road (47).

The road to it is ""a gullied overgrown path winding through hills,"" leading to an old orchard beside a ruined house that was big enough to have more than one ""chimney"" - elements which suggests an abandoned antebellum plantation (234, 89).  The dismal setting is described identically in the two texts, and includes: ""a clump of ragged cedars, the ruins of old chimneys, a depression which was once a well or a cistern, the old worn-out fields stretching away and a few snaggled trees of what had been an orchard"" (234, 89).  (In ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard"" and <em>The Hamlet</em>, Flem Snopes similarly salts the remains of the garden at the Old Frenchman Place.

A 'gin' is a machine that separates the cotton seeds from the cotton fibers that cloth is made from, and there are a number of them around Yoknapatawpha County.  But it's unusual for a farm to have its own gin.  The big Sartoris plantation does, with its tenants who work on various farms within the plantation, but the other gins in the fictions serve regions of the county.  Presumably Faulkner provides the McCallums with a gin to reinforce the idea of their sturdy independence - the corollary to their patriotic willingness to fight for the country.   Before the Franklin Roosevelt administration, the family ginned the cotton they grew ""right here in their own gin"" (56), but after the federal government started giving farmers ""advice and help, whether he wanted it or not,"" to quote the way Gombault refers to the new regulations governing agricultural production (55), the McCallums stopped growing cotton.  The gin is no longer used, except to store the ""twenty-two bales of orphan cotton"" they refuse to sell under this New Deal (56).

The men who play poker sit in ""chairs"" (296) in one room, the narrator and Mister Ernest sleep elsewhere in their own room, and the bench on which these last two sit at the end of the story is ""against the kitchen wall"" (308).</p>

In the Yoknapatawpha fictions it usually is the second kind of 'stand' that is meant.  In either case, it's a safety precaution: when a group is hunting together, as is also the usual case in Faulkner's fictions, by staying at their 'stands' the hunters know where the other hunters are.   While Mister Ernest and Roth Edmonds hunt on horseback so they can follow the deer and the dogs in ""Race at Morning,"" the other men in the party hunt from the ""stands"" that they are assigned by Ike McCaslin (297). The story's reference to a ""stand-holder"" suggests that these stands are platforms fixed to trees a dozen or so feet above the ground (297), spread out in a line to cover a wider part of the woods and to keep a safe distance between the hunters themselves. The hunters at Hog Bayou camp are also described as ""standers"" (300), i.e. men who hunt from tree stands.</p>

(His last name may even be Van Dorn - which is also the name of a Confederate General from Mississippi, though that is speculative.)  It is a place on the river, close enough to the hunting camp for the narrator to accuse the buck they chase of eating ""our beans and oats"" during the year (301), and large enough to be home to an unspecified number of Mr. Ernest's ""hands and tenants,"" i.e. paid laborers and tenant farmers (308).  It is where the narrator lived in a ""cabin on the river"" until his parents abandoned him (307), and where he now lives with Mister Ernest himself.  There's an interesting echo here of Sutpen's 'design' in <em>Absalom!</em>, which wasn't just to found a dynasty to leave to his descendants, but to do what Mister Ernest does: to ""take [a poor white] boy"" into his mansion and ""free"" him from the future that his class status predicted (<em>Absalom!</em>, 210).   Sutpen's tragedy is that when the ""nameless"" boy shows up, as Charles Bon, race makes Sutpen feel he cannot open the door.

When Anselm and Cornelia married, it was a thriving place, with both ""white and negro tenants"" (3), and an unspecified number of ""Negro servants"" who work in the house (5), but ""year by year,"" after Anselm drives his sons away, it deteriorates: at the time of his death, ""the good broad fields"" have gone ""back to jungle and gully,"" and ""the very house was falling down on his head"" (9).  A location in both ""Fool about a Horse"" and <em>The Hamlet</em> is the large farm that belongs to <em>Anse</em> Holland, and it is possible that Faulkner imagines ""Anse Holland's Place"" (which has its own entry in the index) and Anselm's place as the same site.  But the earliest of those other two stories, ""Fool about a Horse,"" clearly locates its Holland place in Frenchman's Bend, and the place in ""Smoke"" seems to exist in a different section in the county and - as a decaying plantation - a different place in Faulkner's imagination.</p>

But the beating his son gave Anse on the spot only appeared to kill him.  Another man, a cousin, finishes the job, staging the scene to make it look like a riding accident.  In the first case the motive was outraged filial piety.  In the second, the motive is material: to acquire the Mardis estate, ""two thousand acres of some of the best land in the county"" (21).  The whole estate, however, is referred to by Gavin Stevens in his reconstruction of the crime as a kind of cemetery, not just Cornelia's ""heritage"" but also her ""mausoleum"" (18).

"941","Back in the Hills","","","","","","","<p>In the Yoknapatawpha fictions, the term 'hill country' usually means the area east of Jefferson.  The wealthy planters occupy the rich soil in the flat lands and river bottoms that are often closer to town, but the land in the hills is poorer and harder to work, and the people who live there - the 'country people' or 'hill folk' - often struggle for subsistence.  There are lots of what Digital Yoknapatawpha terms Locations in this area, but this Location represents the specific place ""back in the hills,"" as Ratliff puts it in <em>The Hamlet</em>, that Ab Snopes retreats to after he was whipped - and perhaps worse - by Bayard Sartoris, Uncle Buck McCaslin and Ringo.  The whipping occurs <em>The Unvanquished</em> (175), which also describes Ab's cabin as ""back in the hills"" (159), but when in <em>The Hamlet</em> Ratliff says Ab ""skulks back in the hills,"" it sounds less like Ab went home and more like he sought to hide in the less cultivated, wilder parts of that area.  He has reasons to hide: the shame of being whipped by a Negro, and his criminal connection with Grumby and his gang of outlaws; more than one description of the hill culture in the fictions notes that sheriffs are afraid to go into that part of the county.

"946","Jefferson Church","","","","","","","<p>According to <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, there are at least ""three churches"" in Yoknapatawpha as early as 1833.  That number probably includes the one that Sutpen attends, which is outside Jefferson; it is most likely Episcopalian, the preferred denomination for the planter class.  And one of them is the Methodist church in Jefferson in which Goodhue Coldfield is a steward.  Nothing more is said in <em>Absalom</em> about the third church, but one of the narrators of the <em>The Town</em> says that the two ""oldest congregations in the county"" are the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians (321).  On the other hand, on the page before in <em>The Town</em> the same narrator, Charles Mallison, says ""ours was a town founded by Aryan Baptists and Methodists, for Aryan Baptists and Methodists"" (320).  Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist - these four denominations are the only organized religions in Yoknapatawpha throughout the fictions.  Various texts refer to one or another of these by name.  The 'Baptist church,' for example, is mentioned in three other texts.  Gail Hightower's church in <em>Light in August</em> is identified as Presbyterian.  And according to <em>The  Town</em> the small Episcopal church is ""the oldest extant building in town"" (321). This entry, then, gathers together the Jefferson churches that are mentioned but not described or denominated.  Besides the 'third' in <em>Absalom!</em>, this group includes the church that Hawkshaw ""joins"" soon after arriving in town in ""Hair"" (141); the church where Uncle Willy and the boy who narrates his story attend Sunday school; the ""church bells"" in the ""Sunday steeples"" that ring out in <em>The Town</em> to celebrate the end of the First World War (118); and the ""two churches"" in Jefferson that, in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, are built before the Civil War using the same brick molds as were used in building the courthouse.  If Faulkner is being consistent, one of these would be Episcopalian, as described in <em>The Town</em>, which is presumably the same as ""the right church"" that Temple Drake Gowan says she and Gowan belong to (124) - 'right' here referring to the class status of the congregants, not their theological beliefs.  And the other would be Presbyterian.  However, we can never assume Faulkner is being consistent.  Despite that line in <em>The Town</em> about the age of the Episcopal church, in several other texts the Holston House, a tavern, is described as the 'oldest extant building in town.'</p>

It consists of ""a store and four or five houses and a sawmill"" (137).  One of the best houses is town belongs to his fiancee's family, the Starneses - though it is heavily mortaged.  In the nearby county seat is the bank that holds the mortgage.  On our map, this one icon represents the town and the bank as well as that house, the store, and the graveyard where the Starneses are all buried during the course of the story.  When the narrator pays a visit to the empty house, he describes it in some detail: ""clean inside as a hospital""; ""a melodeon in the corner, and a lamp and a Bible on the table""; and above the mantel, the framed wedding license that was never used (146).  (Although the story never discusses the name of the town, other Faulkner texts make it likely that it derives from the way railroad companies 'divided' their tracks into long segments, each maintained and managed by a crew stationed at 'division points' between the segments.)</p>

"951","Memphis Junction|Junction-Point|Tennessee Junction","","","","","","","<p>The map of Yoknapatawpha that Faulkner drew for <em>Absalom!</em> in 1936 includes an arrow pointing north beyond the county ""To Memphis Junction.""  Typically, a ""junction"" is a point where several railroad lines meet or cross, and so where one could change trains to travel in a new direction.  In the real world Faulkner's derives from, the place where travelers from Oxford changed trains to get to Memphis was Holly Springs, Mississippi.  In one text, <em>Sanctuary</em>, Horace Benbow changes trains at a station with that name, and ""Holly Springs"" has its own entry in this index.  Here we gather together the places from other texts that function in the same way: the ""junction-point"" mentioned in ""Hair"" (143), the ""Tennessee Junction"" where Bayard and Ringo meet Jenny in <em>The Unvanquished</em> (235), and the ""Junction"" or the ""Memphis Junction"" referred to in <em>The Mansion</em> (313, 37), which we assume is also the ""Junction"" within ""thirty miles of Jefferson"" that Mink Snopes passes through much later in the novel (435). Mink is riding in a truck, not a train, and after forty years in the penitentiary is astonished to see the blacktop highway buzzing with traffic in that place (435) - but that road traffic indicates how cars and trucks have replaced passenger trains.  (See also the entries for ""Division Town"" in <em>Light in August</em>, and ""Parsham Inset"" in <em>The Reivers</em>; it's possible that in Faulkner's mind these Locations are versions of this same junction town - though that's more likely in the first case than the second.)</p>

It could have been built in the antebellum era, since that is when his father opened the drug store that Willy also inherited.  The house is on ""a little quiet side street where the other houses are all little new ones"" (237).  The neighborhood is a lower-middle-class one: his new neighbors are ""country people who had moved to town within the last fifteen years, like mail carriers and little storekeepers"" (237).  Presumably Willy's much older house is at the far end of the street, since the property includes both a ""pasture"" and the ""barn"" in which he hides his three-gallon ""can of alcohol"" (235).  The narrator does not specify which ""edge of town""; our decision to locate the house in the southwestern part of Jefferson is based on two narrative details: that Willy walks through the Negro section of town on his way home from the Square (234), and that, when his wife drives back to Memphis, she drives ""across the square"" (238).</p>

The Keeley Cure, as it was called, was most popular around the turn into the 20th century. The center outside Memphis opened in the 1890s.

The story is so vague about its location that we have to do a good deal of speculating about this cemetery.  Here as elsewhere in the fictions, a ""churchyard"" is a burial ground adjacent to a church, where the members of the congregation are buried, but the locale of the story - and thus of the church and churchyard - are identified only as a ""little crossroads hamlet"" about ""twenty-odd miles"" from the town of Jefferson (114, 113).  Given that distance, and the larger context of the <em>Knight's Gambit</em> stories, many of which take place in the hamlet of Frenchman's Bend, it seems reasonable to locate this churchyard in that part of Yoknapatawpha. But even making that assumption doesn't decide the question, because there are two Frenchman's Bend churchyards mentioned elsewhere in Faulkner's fictions.  Rather than guess which one Ellie might be buried in, we have created a separate one for this text.  Three burial grounds for one hamlet may seem like too many - or may seem appropriate, in the still larger context of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha.</p>

The man who buried it, Pritchel's son-in-law Joel Flint, intended it to be found eventually, and identified as him, which is why before he buried it he disguised it as Pritchel.

"986","Christian's Drugstore","","","","","","","<p>In the later novels <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em> Faulkner calls Jefferson's main or only drugstore 'Christian's,' but in the short story ""Uncle Willy,"" where both Willy Christian and his drugstore make their earliest appearance in the fictions, Christian's cannot be the only pharmacy in town, since ""nobody let [Willy] fill a prescription"" (226), his customers do not include the more affluent ""town trade"" (233), and the store is closed and locked for several long periods of time. But when the story says he ""turned sharp off the square"" after leaving his store (234), it implies it is located at the center of town. Willy's father ""started the business in eighteen-fifty-something"" (226), which would make it one of the oldest businesses in Jefferson. Under Willy's management, however, it has become so seedy that his only customers are ""country people"" and Negroes (226). Both the windows and the soda fountain where the town's boys come for free ice cream are conspicuously dirty, and the ""prescription case"" seems only to be used by Willy himself, who keeps his morphine and syringe there (226). Later he supplies his addiction to alcohol from the store. In Mississippi at the time of the story, drugstores and doctors were allowed to stock and dispense alcohol for medicinal purposes; otherwise alcohol was prohibited throughout the state.

India is also offstage in ""Ad Astra,"" but one of the main characters in that story is from India, as are the troops serving with the English forces in the story he tells. The story he tells - especially the way the troops compare the ""rifles"" they are issued to ""spears"" which are ""too short and too heavy"" to ""slay a swift enemy"" (424) - makes ""India"" seem like a very primitive place. (Over one million Indian troops served in the various theaters of World War I.)  The story of her love life that Joan Heppleton tells Horace Benbow in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> actually includes two events set in India.  Bombay - known today as Mumbai - is where the British man for whom she left her first husband ""deserted"" her, and Calcutta - now Kolkata - is where she met and married her second husband, a young American working for the Standard Oil Company (321).

In 1938 Munich, Germany, was the site where leaders from England, France and Italy met with Adolph Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, to sanction his annexation of Czechoslovakia; this act of appeasement was supposedly meant, as the British Prime Minister who signed it famously said, ""peace for our time.""  Gavin's ""it,"" on the other hand, refers to the inevitability of a major war.

"991","Jefferson Female Academy","","","","","","","<p>Jefferson seems to contain both an Academy and a Female Academy, though the distinction between these two private secondary schools grows less clear across the four texts that mention one or the other or both - if indeed they are two separate institutions.  The ""Academy"" is mentioned first, in ""Knight's Gambit,"" where it is described as a co-educational ""prep school"" (205).  Charles Mallison attends it on the eve of World War II, but a generation earlier his mother and several other upper class girls attended ""the female half of the Academy"" (153).  In the three later novels that mention either or both Academies, there's no question about the gendered nature of the ""Female"" one.  In <em>The Town</em>, for example, Gavin Stevens calls it an ""anachronistic vacuum"" (303): ""one of the last of those gentle and stubbornly fading anachronisms called Miss So-and-So's or The So-and-So Female Academy or Institute whose curriculum included deportment and china-painting,"" and where young women are also taught that ""not just American history but all history had not yet reached Christmas Day, 1865"" - because the Civil War ""was not done""; Gavin adds that these schools ""continue to dot the South though the rest of the United States knows them no more"" (300-01). It is clearly all-female in the earlier <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, and very prestigious: acccording to that novel's narrator, ""to a young woman of North Mississippi or West Tennessee"" a graduation ""certificate"" from this finishing school would be as valuable as an ""invitation . . . signed by Queen Victoria"" would be to ""a young female from Long Island or Philadelphia"" (177).  In <em>The Town</em>, on the other hand, it's only attended by a ""dwindling few"" young women (301).  It's still there, however, in <em>The Mansion</em> - though to add still more confusion to the story, in that novel Linda Snopes, who attended the Academy in <em>The Town</em>, attends instead a place called the ""Seminary,"" which is apparently another finishing school rather than, as its name suggests, a religious institution - unless one thinks of genteel culture as sacred.  Rather than try to reconcile these conflicting accounts, we include separate entries for the ""Academy"" and the ""Seminary.""</p>

"992","Cuba","","","","","","","<p>Four of the 5 references to Cuba in the fictions mention it in the context of the Spanish-American War at the end of the 19th century.  This was the first foreign war the U.S. fought after the Civil War, and at the time was talked about as the proof that former enemies from 'the North' and 'the South' could fight side by side under the same American flag.  ""My Grandmother Millard,"" for example, looks ahead ""thirty years"" from its Civil War setting to note that the Confederate general Wheeler ""commanded in Cuba"" (673), and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> mentions that the sons of surviving Confederate soldiers - ""those tottering old men in gray"" - had fought and died ""in blue coats in Cuba"" (189).  Both <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em> mention the action that Manfred de Spain saw in Cuba, though there is some ambiguity about exactly what kind of action it was that left him ""with a long jagged scar"" (11, 142).  The only other reference to Cuba occurs in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, when Herbert Head tries to placate Quentin Compson by offering him a cigar that he bought with the help of a friend ""in Havana"" (108).</p>

"995","Backus-Harriss Plantation","","","","","","","<p>In 3 late fictions Faulkner creates a new plantation in Yoknapatawpha that is either three or six miles from Jefferson, depending on the novel.  The plantation, described in <em>The Mansion</em> as one of Yoknapatawpha's ""biggest"" (217), originally belongs to the Backus family.  It seems safe to assume it was built before the Civil War, but none of the three texts look back that far into the past.  They focus instead on the fate of the plantation in the 20th century, and treat its genteel decline and nouveau riche resurrection as a kind of parable of a danger facing the modern South: not the rise of poor whites like the Snopeses but the influx of wealthy outsiders - though both groups have in common a failure to appreciate the traditional values of an aristocratic culture.  ""Knight's Gambit"" tells this story in the most detail, from the stewardship by Mr. Backus, a ""widower-owner who stayed at home and farmed his heritage"" (150) and who has long-standing relationships with the tenant farmers who work his land, to the way the rich New Orleans bootlegger named Harriss whom his daughter marries ""transmogrifies"" the estate into something that ""looked like the Southern mansion in the moving picture, only about five times as big and ten times as Southern"" (162).  <em>The Town</em> calls it ""a cross between a Kentucky country club and a Long Island race track"" (187-88).  <em>The Mansion</em> echoes this - ""what had been just a simple familiar red-ink north Mississippi cotton plantation"" is ""changed into a Virginia or Long Island horse farm"" (217) - and expresses relief when Harriss is violently killed and the place can again fall into genteel shabbiness.  Ultimately the daughter marries Gavin Stevens, and in his hands it will almost certainly live happily ever after.</p>

"998","Jefferson High School","","","","","","","<p>The school system in Jefferson remains segregated throughout the fictions, so white and black students never learn together under one roof.  But how many white public schools there are in town is hard to determine.  It seems clear in some fictions that Faulkner imagines that Jefferson has only one building for white students in all grades from 1st to 12th - though there's never any suggestion of a one-room schoolhouse in the town, like the one in the much smaller Frenchman's Bend.  In other fictions it's not clear how many school buildings there might be; in these cases we create just one location.  But when Charles Mallison says in <em>The Town</em> that since Linda Snopes is ""in high school"" and he goes to ""grammar school,"" there's no way he can say if she's ""still going to school or not"" (197), at least this once Jefferson High has its own building.  And since that happens in <em>The Town</em>, we assume that is also the case in the other three texts that mention the high school specifically: <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, where Charles is on ""the high school football team"" (121); ""Knight's Gambit,"" where Gavin Stevens Gavin mentions ""Jefferson High"" in his listing of schools (172); and <em>The Mansion</em>, where Essie Meadowfill is ""valedictorian of her high school class"" (361).

The ""house had a little piece of ground with it, that old man Snopes made into a truck garden and water-melon patch"" (137).   According to Chick Mallison, old man Snopes doesn't sell or eat the watermelons: they are ""bait for the pleasure or sport or contest or maybe just getting that mad, of catching boys robbing it; planting and cultivating and growing water-melons just so he could sit ambushed with a loaded shotgun behind a morning glory vine on his back gallery until he could hear sounds from the melon patch and then shooting at it"" (137).</p>
