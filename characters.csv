His attempt to preseve tradition and heritage is exemplified both in his household, by the carriage in which he is driven, as well as at the bank he runs, where he refuses to make loans to people who want to buy an automobile.

He arrived in Jefferson around 1837, where he built a large plantation home four miles north of town. He married a daughter of Rosa Millard, with whom he fathered three children, two daughters whose names are never revealed (born, judging from the three children's ages as revealed in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, around 1847 and 1852), and a son, Bayard. At the start of the Civil War, he raised the first regiment of Confederate soldiers in the county and went to Virginia to fight. Elected Colonel at the outset, a year later he was voted out by the troops and returned to Mississippi, where he raised another unit of Partisan Rangers. His success in raids caused the Union Army to put a price on his head. During Reconstruction he killed two carpetbaggers who were in Jefferson petitioning for civil rights for recently freed slaves. During the same postwar years, Sartoris grew in stature as a politician and businessman, building a railroad that was completed in 1876.  Soon after that, he ran for the state Legislature, defeating his former business partner, named ""Redlaw"" in <em>Flags</em>, who in a final act of desperation stemming from years of rivalry killed Sartoris in 1876.</p><br />","Murder","0xFFFFFF","","","showCharHover","t","Sartoris plantation","8","","","Carolina","""A Rose for Emily"", ""Ambuscade"", ""Barn Burning"", ""My Grandmother Millard and General Bedford Forrest and the Battle of Harrykin Creek"", ""Raid"", ""Retreat"", ""Shall Not Perish"", ""Skirmish at Sartoris"", ""The Unvanquished"", ""There Was a Queen"", ""Vendee"", Absalom, Absalom!, Go Down, Moses, Light in August, Requiem for a Nun, The Mansion, The Reivers , The Sound and the Fury, The Town, The Unvanquished","i(The Sound and the Fury); i(Light in August); i(Absalom, Absalom!); i(The Unvanquished); i(Go Down, Moses); i(Requiem for a Nun); i(The Town); i(The Mansion); i(The Reivers);  ""A Rose for Emily""; ""There Was a Queen""; ""Barn Burning""; ""My Grandmother Millard""; ""Shall Not Perish""","","=round(((1/(sqrt(RC[-17])*.6))*if((RC[-16]=""male""),20,23)))","1 139","419","Sartoris, Colonel John","1390","Individual","","","","0","John Sartoris I","18838","Colonel John Sartoris' Mother","","","SartorissInFD","Monday, September 4, 1876"

His final action in ""Spotted Horses"" of giving Mrs. Armstid a five cent bag of candy rather than returning her five dollars is typical of the kinds of callous transactions that enable his rise in the novels of the Snopes trilogy.</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","""Barn Burning"", ""Centaur in Brass"", ""Lizards in Jamshyd’s Courtyard"", As I Lay Dying, Flags in the Dust, The Hamlet, The Mansion, The Reivers , The Town","","No","","1 760","1 210","Snopes, Flem","1637","Individual","","","","0","Flem Snopes","19051","","","","SnopessInSH",""

"""A Rose for Emily""","RE","Unnamed Narrator","","White","Male","Middle Class","Major","Alive","","","","","","Grierson House","<p>""A Rose for Emily"" is a first-person narrative, but the identity of its narrator is very hard to establish.  It seems very safe to say that his race is ""White"" - note, for example, how consistently he refers to Tobe as ""the Negro"" (120, 121 etc.).  Our icon also represents the narrator as male; at times the differing actions and motives of ""the men"" and ""the women"" are narrated with equal detachment (119, etc.), but a phrase like ""only a woman could have believed"" mayor Sartoris' fiction about the taxes makes it seem more likely that narrator is a man.  The narrator's age is equally elusive, given the equally detached way ""he"" talks about ""Colonel Sartoris' generation"" and ""the next generation"" (120, etc.).  He seems to feel a slight resentment at the Grierson's upper-class status, which may imply that ""he"" is middle class, but that is by no means clear.  He is explicitly present when the locked door is broken in at the end (""for a long while we just stood there,"" 130), but inexplicably, or at least in a way that is never explained, ""he"" also seems implicitly to be present at every other scene he describes, from the midnight visit to de-odorize Emily's house to the funeral for her.  Given the way the narrator refers to himself with the first-person plural - ""we,"" ""our"" - the voice of the story could be identified as a collective one, the way ""the town"" regards and discusses Emily over many different decades.  In other texts, Faulkner often has a third-person narrator quote or paraphrase what ""the town"" or ""the people"" say or think about the story's events.  But if that is his idea here, then it is important to note that the <em>race</em> of this narrator is unambiguously <em>white</em>, that ""Negroes"" are consistently depicted as outside the communal ""we"" that the narrative constructs, that his references to something like ""our whole town"" (119) implicitly refer only to 'the white people of Jefferson.'</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No","","","","Unnamed Narrator","1868","Individual","","","","0","Unnamed Narrator 1","20993","","","","",""

Nine years old in the events of this story, Quentin developed a close bond with Nancy, one of his family's domestic servants.

Fifteen years later, Quentin remembers Nancy amidst reflections on the modernization of Jefferson, though in this story, there is no account of the intervening years of Quentin's life. There is a problem with his larger chronology beyond this story given that Quentin commits suicide in 1910 in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>. It is not clear how he can be alive and looking back 15 years from the 1920s. However, while Faulkner later added the first paragraph of the story that gives the timeline of ""15 years""  for its original publication in the <em>American Mercury</em> in 1931 (see the Note on the Text), there is evidence that suggests that Faulkner may have conceived of ""That Evening Sun"" before <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>.</p><br />","","","","","","","","","First Person","","","""A Bear Hunt"", ""A Justice"", ""Appendix: Compson"", ""Lion"", Absalom, Absalom!, The Mansion, The Sound and the Fury","","Yes","","","","Compson, Quentin","2153","Individual","","","","0","Quentin Compson III","18887","Jason (father);Mother","","","CompsonsInTES",""

When, later, Byron moves among them at night in the Square, they are made of mainly of ""the group that sat nightly in front of the drug store"" (273),  the young couples courting by going to the movies and ""more sedate groups"" of men, women and children window shopping (274).</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha","2974","Group","","","","0","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 1","20634","","","","",""

He seems obsessed with money, which is a stereotypically antisemitic trope, but it's easy to sympathize with his desire to get paid enough, given the way he risks his life in every performance.

The first novel depicts her receiving and losing the letters that she recovers in this story - in a way that makes the extreme sexual prissiness she displays in the second novel more complex.</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","Yoknapatawpha","Flags in the Dust, Sanctuary, The Mansion, The Town","","","","","","Sartoris, Narcissa Benbow","3426","Individual","","","","0","Narcissa Benbow Sartoris","18866","","","","SartorissInTWQ;BenbowsInTWQ",""

From their ""ancestors"" the current people of ""the town"" seem to have inherited strong critical opinions about strangers, outsiders, or any resident of Jefferson suspected of unconventional behavior. When Faulkner refers to the town, he sometimes intends for us to understand that the whole of white Jefferson shares a common opinion and judgment on a particular matter (e.g., shunning Joanna Burden because of her racial attitudes, family history, and present behavior). At other times, he divides the Jefferson townsfolk by class, gender, age, or profession (e.g., according to whether they know that Christmas and Brown sell bootleg whisky). At still other times, he shows segments of the town or the townspeople to be in disagreement (e.g., according to whether they wish to protect or prosecute the men who beat up Hightower).

Saturday, ""April Seventh, 1928"" - the date and title of his section - is his thirty-third birthday, although that means nothing to him.  Having no concept of time, Benjy experiences the world almost entirely through physical sensations.  Stimuli in 1928 set off a set of memories from his earlier life, which he seems to relive as if they were happening in the present.  Because readers get to know him from within his consciousness in that first section, it often comes as a shock to read narrator's description of him in fourth section and see him from without: he is ""a big man"" whose ""skin was dead looking and hairless. . . . His eyes were clear, of the pale sweet blue of cornflowers, his thick mouth hung open, drooling a little"" (274).  That narrator also provides a description of the sound Benjy makes so often in his section (which Luster refers to as ""that moaning,"" 4): ""Ben wailed again, hopeless and prolonged.  It was nothing.  Just sound"" (288).  Benjy does have many reasons to cry.  His name is not the only thing he has lost.  His father, for example, sells ""the pasture,"" Benjy's favorite part of the family property, to send his brother Quentin to Harvard.  Around his seventeenth year, after his attempt to reach out to the young daughter of the Burgess family next door is misinterpreted as an attempted rape, he is surgically castrated.

""Father said"" is one of the most frequent phrases in Quentin's section, and in those memories Quentin again and again recalls his father's fatalism.  For example, Mr. Compson gives Quentin his watch (a family heirloom which was passed down by Quentin's great-grandfather to his grandfather and then to Quentin's father), and Quentin recalls his father describing the gift of the watch as follows: ""I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire; it's rather excruciating-ly apt that you will use it to gain the reducto absurdum of all human experience which can fit your individual needs no better than it fitted his or his father's.""

For instance, after Hightower is rejected by his congregation, it is ""loafers and such,"" men ""who never went to church"" and ""little boys who did not know exactly"" what the scandal was about, who listen to Hightower preach, and then, after his congregation finally locks him out of the church, it is a similarly male-identified group that witnesses his humiliation standing at the door  (70).  The novel's groups of men behave in multiple and sometimes contradictory ways when race, gender, sexuality are at issue.  Hightower's employment of female and male Negro cooks, for example, occasions violent reprisals as well as offers of protection from differing groups including, presumably, the Ku Klux Klan. The novel never directly identifies the members of the Ku Klux Klan, but Hightower receives a threat signed ""K.K.K.""

Since elsewhere the novel says that Joanna's ""neighborhood"" is ""populated, when at all, by negroes"" (258), the fact that the crowd includes people ""from the immediate neighborhood"" suggests it includes some blacks, although since the description of it contains phrases like ""faces identical with one another"" and notes that ""they"" call the killer a ""<em>black son of a </em>"" (291) and in the past called his victim a ""Nigger lover"" (292), it is obviously almost entirely white.

As spectators, they are suspicious of newcomers - again like the people of Jefferson.

The town sheriff worries that the crowd may turn into a lynch mob, but they respond with talk instead of violence.  Much of Chapter 14 (pages 349-361) is in quotation marks, but no single person is speaking.  Instead, Faulkner allows the town and surrounding countryside to describe both Christmas' and the Hineses' behavior.  It is introduced with a description of ""the talk"" that circulated ""in electrically lighted rooms and in remote hill cabins with kerosene lamps,"" about ""country churches"" or the ""dooryards of houses"" (349).  This collective voice is mostly male (talking to ""wives and families"" or while ""womenfolks are in the kitchen, getting dinner"" (349).

Anse seems to assume that ""their"" reason for taking Darl has something to do with his strangeness, and if that is true then ""they"" may instead be agents of state's the mental health system (like the two men who take Darl away at the end of the novel).  But the novel nowhere suggests Darl has been institutionalized before his mother's death, and it does say he served in France ""at the war"" (254).  Almost 3,000,000 men were drafted between 1917 and 1918.</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Unnamed Government Agents","6605","Group","","","","0","Unnamed Government Agents","21330","","","","",""

And when Faulkner revised the story for inclusion in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the boy is Ike McCaslin.  But in this first, magazine publication of the story, the boy's identity is left unspecified.  He does refer in three places in the story to ""Uncle Ike"" (206, 207), which might suggest that the boy is a McCaslin; however, in other Faulkner texts, Ike McCaslin is often referred to ""Uncle"" even though there is no relation between McCaslin and the characters who call him ""Uncle.""  What is clear about the boy's identity is that he belongs to one of the oldest Yoknapatawpha planter families (his great-grandfather bought slaves from the Chickasaw ""almost a hundred years ago,"" 203).  He resides on a farm ""four miles from Jefferson"" (203). The boy's unnamed father is hunting partners with Major de Spain and Walter Ewell and as soon as he is old enough, the boy becomes a member of the group that annually goes into the big woods to hunt.   But more important to him than his white upper-class patrimony is what he has learned, about hunting and life from Sam Fathers.

In the magazine version, Faulkner provided no name for his young protagonist and changed his age to ten. Apart from these revisions, the boy remains largely the same, for he is upper-class, a member of one of the old Yoknapatawpha families and the presumptive heir of a plantation, as indicated by the ""old heavy biscuit-thick silver watch"" he was given by his grandfather (289). The boy is obsessed with the mythology of Old Ben, a bear whom his father and his hunting companions have been unable to kill despite repeated efforts. During the course of the story, Sam Fathers teaches the boy how to hunt in the wilderness and, through this tutelage and his friendship with the older man, the boy encounters the ideological limits of the plantation system into which he was born, perceiving ""the wilderness, the big woods, bigger and older than any recorded document of white man fatuous enough to believe he had bought any fragment of it or Indian ruthless enough to pretend that any fragment of it had been his to convey"" (293).</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","Yoknapatawpha","""The Old People"", Go Down, Moses","","","","","","Unnamed Boy Hunter","7497","Individual","","","","0","Unnamed Boy Hunter|Narrator 10","20793","Unnamed Father of Boy Hunter","","","",""

The uncertain meaning of 'uncle' in his case reflects the ambiguous way he is depicted in the narrative: at times as a figure of comedy, with a clownish laugh and an affinity for larceny that leads the ""reivers"" into much of the trouble that befalls them; at others as an intelligent man whose race exposes him to shameful abuses, and whose scheming seems entirely justified by his social disenfranchisement.

The son of a prominent planter who becomes a Colonel in the Confederate army, Bayard looks up to and admires his father.

As boys, neither he nor his friend and servant Ringo understand what is really happening, and the novel uses Bayard's innocence both comically and to make a serious point about knowledge as both gain and loss.  The events become increasingly destructive, forcing Bayard to become more independent and violent.  The last story takes place a decade later.  After his father's death, he becomes ""The Sartoris"" - the role is traditional, but he both accepts and redefines it.

He had two daughters (unnamed in Faulkner's works) and a son, Bayard. Although his wife is mentioned, until he marries Drusilla Hawk in this novel Sartoris is a widower.  During the Civil War he fought for the South as both a regular and an irregular Confederate Colonel. He is seen through the eyes of the narrator, his son Bayard. As such (in the beginning of the novel), he appears as a larger than life figure who raised a regiment and came ""within spitting distance"" (52) of Washington D.C. while fighting with Stonewall Jackson in Virginia. After he gets voted out of his command by the ""politicians and fools"" (51) in his regiment, he returns to Mississippi and, with his troop of irregulars, harasses and fights the Union army in that area.  Later in the novel, an older Bayard sees him less as a hero and more as man with ""intolerant"" eyes (236); the eyes of a man who has ""killed too much"" (231).  After the South's surrender, Sartoris returns to his home to rebuild the plantation house that was burned by Yankees during the war, to build Jefferson's railroad, and to make sure that the newly emancipated slaves do not vote. (This novel provides the third time Faulkner recounts how he killed the Burdens to disenfranchise black voters; the first is in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, the second in <em>Light in August</em>.  This third time the killings are intertwined with the comedy of his marriage to Drusilla.)  Throughout the novel, Bayard's attitude towards his father changes (just like the reader's); in the end, the once larger-than-life hero can been seen a taunting bully who brings on his own death by tormenting his former friend and business partner, Ben Redmond.  On the other hand, also at the end his about-to-be-widow defends him as a hero who's actions are good for ""all the people, black and white"" (223).  Bayard's final statement about him is ambiguous enough to accommodate both conclusions: his father's dream was ""something he had bequeathed us which we could never forget"" (253).</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","Carolina","""Ambuscade"", ""Barn Burning"", ""My Grandmother Millard and General Bedford Forrest and the Battle of Harrykin Creek"", ""Raid"", ""Retreat"", ""Skirmish at Sartoris"", ""The Unvanquished"", ""There Was a Queen"", ""Vendee"", Absalom, Absalom!, Flags in the Dust, Light in August, Requiem for a Nun, The Hamlet, The Mansion, The Reivers , The Town","","","","","","Sartoris, John","9925","Individual","","","","0","John Sartoris I","18838","","","","SartorissInUV","Wednesday, October 1, 1873 to Friday, October 31, 1873"

This struggle often leads to comic situations in the novel, but her faith in Southern traditions and the chivalric code betrays her tragically when she presumes upon it to take on the outlaw Grumby, who apparently has no compunctions about killing a 'lady' in cold blood.

Faulkner first wrote about Lucas in earlier, comic short stories, where there is no hint of his McCaslin ancestry, and his portrayal in the novel is at times in that vein, but at other times, in new material written for <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Faulkner uses Lucas' experiences to explore the issue of race and racism in new ways.  He remains on the McCaslin plantation, working as a tenant farmer for the Edmonses, and in a bank account has the $1000 legacy that had been set aside from Carothers McCaslin's estate for his black descendants, but while Ike McCaslin struggles with the guilt that attaches to his inheritance, Lucas - at least at moments in the novel - reflects the difficulties of being a black man in the 'white' South.  He is a major character in Faulkner's next novel, <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, and one of the most impressive and complex black characters in Faulkner's fiction.</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","""A Point of Law"", ""Go Down, Moses"", ""Gold Is Not Always"", ""Pantaloon in Black"", Intruder in the Dust, The Reivers","","","","","","Beauchamp, Lucas","10202","Individual","","","","0","Lucas Quintus Carothers McCaslin Beauchamp","19015","Tennie Beauchamp;Tomey's Turl","","","McCaslinsInGDM",""

In the novel's next chapter, ""The Bear,"" ""Tennie's Jim"" appears again in the woods (189), and even once at the Edmonds-McCaslin place (220), but still just as one of the servants.

Born a slave in 1864 (259), James left Yoknapatawpha and ""vanished sometime on night of his twenty-first birthday"" (260), without claiming the $1000 inheritance left by Lucius McCaslin, the white slave-owner who was his grandfather and great-grandfather.  The novel makes no explicit connection between the black servant in the woods (""Tennie's Jim"") and the biracial exiled child of the McCaslin family (James Beauchamp) until the second to last chapter, ""Delta Autumn.""  There his granddaughter arrives at the white hunters' camp in the Delta woods and in a pointed moment identifies ""James Beauchamp"" as her grandfather, telling Ike McCaslin that ""you called him Tennie's Jim though he had a name"" (343).

But there is some confusion about the ""Mrs. Compson"" who appears in five of this novel's chapters.  Chronologically, she should be ""Mrs. Jason Compson II"" - the wife of the General Compson who is the grandfather of the children in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and to whom Judith Sutpen delivers a letter during the War in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> And in four of those five stories, that seems to be the case.  But in one story - ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" - Bayard notes that her ""only husband"" had been ""locked up for crazy a long time ago"" (193), and this cannot the General.  Faulkner himself may simply be confused, but the way we have chosen to reflect this inconsistency in the data is to create ""Mrs. Compson(2)"" for the character who appears in that one story; she has a separate entry.  But in every other respect this 'other' Mrs. Compson seems identical with this original one.  Like her hat and parasol, she stands for lady-like decorum.

The two brothers introduce very unconventional ideas and arrangements to the plantation they inherit, but they compete with each other for the chance to fight in the Confederate Army; Buck loses the poker game that decides this, and so remains at home during the War.

When he becomes a clerk, Flem attempts to dress the part, donning a clumsily hand-made white shirt, replacing it each week with another just like it (19, 24); he also wears a cloth cap, and affects a ""minute"" machine-made bow tie (93, 300, 323). Once he begins to establish himself with - and increasingly at the expense of - Jody Varner, Flem begins to bring in some of his ""cousins"" to fill various positions in the Varner enterprise. He agrees to marry Eula Varner, who is pregnant by a suitor who has deserted her, and takes the Old Frenchman's Place as her dowry. He then tricks Ratliff and two others into buying the property from him and goes on to Jefferson.</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","""Barn Burning"", ""By the People"", ""Centaur in Brass"", ""Lizards in Jamshyd’s Courtyard"", ""Spotted Horses"", As I Lay Dying, Flags in the Dust, The Mansion, The Reivers , The Town","","","","","","Snopes, Flem","10682","Individual","","","","1","Flem Snopes","19051","Ab Snopes;Ab Snopes' Wife","","","SnopessInH",""

In <em>The Hamlet</em>, he is a thirty-three-year-old man (240) who has spent the last four years mourning the loss of his wife, Lucy Pate, with a ""black, savage, indomitable fidelity"" (227). In the earlier short story ""The Hound,"" Houston is prosperous but, in this novel, his unpaid debt to Will Varner and the resulting foreclosure on his property have diminished his wealth. The borrowed money funded a new house and furnished it, but Houston's eventual inability to repay the sum leads to the loss of a significant portion of his property, which plays some part in his eventual enmity with Mink Snopes, who rents that land from Varner. Houston still possesses a house and some remaining land as is evident in Ike Snopes stealing his grazing cow and a judge ruling that Mink Snopes pay Houston three dollars pasturage (178), even though the land belongs to Varner (100). Faulkner describes Houston as a highly competent individual who enters manhood at the age of fourteen being already ""acquainted with whiskey"" and ""the possessor of a mistress - a negro girl two or three years his senior"" (228). Houston's early adolescence was spent learning to run his father's farm and was followed by a brief education until he left Yoknapatawpha at the age of sixteen in order to escape the inevitability of marrying Lucy Pate and due to his ""lust, not for life, not even for movement, but for that fetterless immobility called freedom"" (228). Over the next thirteen years, he worked first as a time-keeper in a railroad construction camp in Oklahoma and then as a ""Kansas wheat-hand,"" moving to ""herding sheep in New Mexico"" and then working ""with a construction gang in Arizona and West Texas and then a longshoreman on the Galveston docks"" (234). He eventually settles in El Paso ""as a locomotive fireman"" living with a woman whom he took ""out of a Galveston brothel"" (234). With the death of his father, he splits his savings in half, giving one portion to and abandoning the woman with whom he lived for seven years. He returns home to Mississippi, lives for one year off of his savings and then marries Lucy, who dies sixth month later.

At 21, Labove is hired to be the schoolmaster in Frenchman's Bend; Will Varner lends him a horse so that he can continue to earn his degree in law at the university, while tending to the school during the weekdays. Faulkner initially describes him as ""gaunt, with straight black hair coarse as a horse's tail and high Indian cheekbones and quiet pale hard eyes and the long nose of thought but with the slightly curved nostrils of pride and the thin lips of secret and ruthless ambition"" (117). He possesses ""a forensic face,"" moreover, ""the face of invincible conviction in the power of words as a principle worth dying for if necessary."" Labove is above all a misanthrope, a man who would in past ages have been a monk, ""a militant fanatic"" ready to turn his ""uncompromising back upon the world"" (117). He arrives in Frenchman's Bend ""in a perfectly clean white shirt which had been washed so often that it now had about the texture of mosquito netting, in a coat and trousers absolutely clean too"" (118). Despite this initial appearance of austere cleanliness, the people around him perceive ""the hungry mouth, the insufferable humorless eyes, the intense ugly blue-shaved face like a composite photograph of Voltaire and an Elizabethan pirate"" (122). Despite and perhaps because of his monastic isolation and disinterest in the people around him, Labove becomes obsessed with Varner's young daughter, Eula, and so stays on as schoolmaster even when his studies are finished.</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Labove","10731","Individual","","","","1","Labove","22666","Labove, Father of Labove","","","",""

She is the daughter of the owner of a logging camp and lost her mother at birth, growing up with her father and his quadroon mistress among laboring convicts. In her youth, she had ""a splendid heavy mane"" of ""black hair"" before cutting it ""man-short with razors"" in order to avoid getting lice from the laborers with whom she has sex promiscuously.  Mink attributes 'masculine' self-reliant qualities to her, moreover. When he first arrives at the logging camp, she looks at him ""not speculatively, but intently and boldly, as a bold and successful man would."" According to Mink, she was ""not a nympholept but the confident lord of a harem"" (262), her room being the ""fierce simple cave of a lioness"" (263). With the collapse of her father's business five months after Mink arrives, the two marry and return to Mink's native country to share crop and produce two children within the first five years of marriage. She grows her hair out again and dyes it (265).

Initially known only as ""Monk,""  the narrator characterizes him as a ""moron, perhaps even a cretin"" (41),  language offensive to modern readers but common and acceptable during the era of the story's composition.  Near the end readers learn that his given name is actually Stonewall Jackson Odlethrop - though it is not clear exactly who gave him any of these names.  He is born in the hill country east of Jefferson, presumably the unwanted child of Mrs. Odelethrop's son and a ""hard"" woman from somewhere else (43).  These parents abandon him, and he lives for ""six or seven years"" with his grandmother (44) and then for ""ten years"" with a moonshiner named Fraser (45).  According to the narrator, ""all"" Monk ever ""learns"" to do is ""make and sell whiskey"" (45), and ""pump"" gas and ""make correct change"" (46).  He begins coming into town when he is ""about twenty-five"" - ""pleasant, impervious to affront, talkative when anyone would listen"" (46).   The narrative's one explicit description of Monk's mental deficiencies is a reference to the ""curious quality of imperfect connection between sense and ratiocination"" (46).  He is convicted twice for two different killings, one of which he is framed for, but one of which he clearly committed.  Yet through it all he retains a kind of innocence and helplessness that appeals to Gavin Stevens' sense of chivalry and perhaps the reader's sympathy.  Stevens can solve part of the mystery of Monk's life and death, but the story leaves unresolved the complex problems of a society and legal system that fail to protect such a fragile individual.</p><br />","Executed","","","","","","","","","","Pine hill country","","","","","","","Odlethrop, Monk","12293","Individual","cognitively disabled","","","0","Monk Odlethrop","22613","Odlethrop;Unnamed Mother of Monk","","","",""

The narrative is very un-Faulknerian in its refusal to provide any details about Willy's past - although Willy himself does mention that he ""graduated from a university"" (245); the narrator either does not know how the sixty-year-old man became so estranged from adult life, or is satisfied with the reason he himself supplies for Willy's unconventional behavior: ""he had had fun all his life in spite of what they had tried to do to him"" (239).

He is the son of Judge Lemuel Stevens, twin brother of Margaret Mallison, and uncle of Chick Mallison. He is Yoknapatawpha's most educated inhabitant, with degrees from Harvard, Heidelberg and the University of Mississippi.  He serves Yoknapatawpha officially as, in turn, the City and the County Attorney, but is even more diligent in his attempts to save both Jefferson at large and the two women in Flem Snopes' life from the modern malaise he associates with the Snopes family.  He is an idealistic, obsessively talkative, and optimistic man, often given to considering complexities, especially his own; he is smitten by Eula Snopes and later, in a different way, by her daughter Linda, and is troubled by his desires for them: ""contriving by clumsy and timorous artifice the accidental encounters in which he still would not and never quite touch, really want to touch, too terrified in fact to touch;  but only to breathe the same air, be laved by the same circumambiance which laved the mistress's moving limbs"" (219).

Ratliff, two of the novel's narrators.  His story can be seen as both a cautionary tale about the modernist forces that threaten the South's traditional social and moral order - this is the role in which the novel's narrators generally cast him - or as a southern variant of the American dream of rising from poverty to wealth and status - this is the way Gavin depicts him in Chapter 17.  Like Thomas Sutpen, the protagonist of <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, Flem's life begins at the bottom, as the poor white son of a shiftless tenant farmer.  In <em>The Town</em> he arrives in Jefferson as the new partner in a disreputable side-street restaurant who lives with his family in a tent; by the end he is the new president of the Sartoris bank and moving into the De Spain family mansion. His success is grounded in a combination of intelligence, determination, secrecy, and a willingness to employ nepotism, thievery, and unscrupulous financial influence. His relationship with Eula's lover, Manfred de Spain, called ""amicable cuckoldry"" by Stevens and Ratliff, is a form of extortion or blackmail on the part of Flem. He is first described as ""a squat uncommunicative man with a neat minute bow tie and opaque eyes and a sudden little hooked nose like the beak of a small hawk"" (4). His behavior intrigues, puzzles, and angers the novel's narrators, who even argue among themselves about his true motivations.  Money, his means if not always his goal, figures prominently in his sequence of ventures. He is apparently prepared to use his daughter, Linda, as well as his wife to achieve his ambition. In her last conversation with Stevens, Eula explains Flem's behavior and concludes: ""You've got to be careful or you'll have to pity him.  You'll have to"" (347).</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","""Barn Burning"", ""By the People"", ""Centaur in Brass"", ""Lizards in Jamshyd’s Courtyard"", ""Spotted Horses"", As I Lay Dying, Flags in the Dust, The Hamlet, The Mansion, The Reivers","","","","","","Snopes, Flem","14001","Individual","impotent","","","1","Flem Snopes","19051","Ab Snopes","","","SnopessInT",""

She arrives in Jefferson with her illegitimate child in a wagon pulled by mules and driven by Flem's ambition.  Her sexual power has a mythic status; Charles Mallison describes Eula's effect on men: ""There was just too much of what she was for any just one human female package to contain and hold: too much of white, too much of female, too much of maybe just glory . . . so that at first sight of her you felt a kind of shock of gratitude just for being alive and being male at the same instant with her in space and time, and then in the next second and forever after a kind of despair because you knew that there never would be enough of any one male to match and hold and deserve her"" (6). Maggie Mallison expresses the female point of view concerning Eula: ""The ladies of Jefferson dont care what she does. What they will never forgive is the way she looks. No: the way the Jefferson gentlemen look at her"" (50).  With an impotent husband, she turns to the town's most eligible bachelor, Manfred de Spain, with whom she has an affair that lasts almost two decades; even in this transgressive role, however, she can be seen as a victim, since her husband exploits the affair to further his own career.  Eula's later concerns center on her daughter's happiness: she becomes Gavin's ally in attempting to separate Linda from Flem, and even exacts a promise from Gavin (to whom she once offered herself) that he will marry Linda.  Eula's fate is a tragic one, although her final sacrifice serves to free Linda.

She seems like contested territory on a number of fronts; various people attempt to direct her education, inheritance, and marital status throughout the novel.  While Eula exacts a promise from Gavin that he will marry her daughter, Linda herself is reluctant to accept his conditional offer of matrimony. At the end of the novel, her mother's suicide releases Linda from her Jefferson ties, and with her 'father's' permission and Gavin's assistance, she leaves Jefferson for Greenwich Village, which Gavin calls ""a place with a few unimportant boundaries but no limitations where young people of any age go to seek dreams"" (367).

The De Spain family is among the most prominent in Jefferson; Manfred's father was a Confederate officer (the real ""Major de Spain"") and, for two days, a Governor of Mississippi (10).  ""De Spain himself was a West Pointer who had gone to Cuba as a second lieutenant with troops and came home with a wound - a long scar running from his hair through his left ear and down his jaw"" (11).

Perhaps because he owns the camp, or perhaps because of his higher class status, De Spain is considered the leader of the group who gather for roughly two weeks in the fall of each year to hunt bear, deer, and other game. Like several other characters in this story, ""Major de Spain"" appears in a number of Faulkner novels and short stories, as a name for two different characters, a father and a son.  From the date of the events in ""A Bear Hunt,"" this De Spain must be the son, Manfred de Spain - who inherited the title of ""Major"" from his father, who in fact served in the Civil War with that rank.  But Manfred is usually depicted as a bachelor (though he is given a son in ""Shall Not Perish""), and this story's first narrator notes that he has a wife and married daughters.  The narrative itself reveals him to be impatient and domineering, which is certainly characteristic of Manfred elsewhere.

Faulkner provides a new detail concerning him, his bank and Byron Snopes, the Snopes who figured most prominently in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (1929).  It turns out that Colonel Sartoris hired Byron out of loyalty to the memory of  his father's command.  Sartoris was badly frightened by an automobile, which led him to try banning them in Jefferson; it seems ironic, then, that he is killed in an automobile accident.

This entry represents the ""town,"" the people of Jefferson as a group, in that larger role - as spectators, commentators and interpreters - at various points in the narrative.  As a group, they often preserve the history of Yoknapatawpha; Gavin, for instance, mentions the men who were still alive in his childhood who before the Civil War ""had actually seen"" the steamboat that Ikkemotubbe, one of the Chickasaw chiefs, lived in as his 'big house' (331).  Occasionally these folks also take a more active role in the story, as when ""plenty"" of the people who had watched Mrs. Hait's house burn down seek out I.O. Snopes in the Square to ""keep him posted"" (252).  But their typical role is to serve as witnesses to what happens during the novel's present: before the board of aldermen meets to try to settle Gavin's official complaint against Mayor de Spain, for example, these ""folks coming up the streets and gathering in the Square, [are] laughing and making jokes back and forth"" (89).  The novel's three narrators repeatedly refer to this anonymous group.  ""More people than you would have thought"" send flowers to Eck Snopes' funeral (117); a large group attends Eula's funeral in person, ""The women inside and the men standing around the little front yard and along the street, all neat and clean and wearing coats and not quite looking at each other while they talked quietly about crops and weather"" (360).  ""The whole county"" seems to be in the Square to watch Matt Levitt drive away (208); similarly at the end of the novel ""a considerable crowd"" gathers at the train station to watch the four children of Byron Snopes depart Jefferson (389).  A variety of people view the confrontations between Mrs. Hait, I.O. Snopes, and his mules : ""the ladies in the peignors and boudoir caps of morning, the children playing in the yards, and the people Negro and white who happened to be passing at the moment"" (247).  Most of the references to this group implies that ""Jefferson"" is white, but as this last example shows, at times the local audience for the novel's events includes the Negro population.  While the narrators assume this group always thinks or feels the same way, on at least one occasion town opinion is split: Jeffersonians disagree over how to dispose of the Eula Snopes-Manfred de Spain affair: ""Two camps: the one that said the sin must be exposed now, it had already lasted eighteen years too long; the other which said it dare not be exposed now and so reveal our own baseness in helping to keep it hidden all this long time""; and even these two camps, says Chick Mallison, are ""split in turn into what you might call a hundred individual nonconforming bivouacs"" (322).</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople","14308","Group","","","","0","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 19","20620","","","","",""

The son of Ab and Lennie Snopes (not mentioned in this novel), he has followed his father from tenant farm to tenant farm until that fateful day in <em>The Hamlet</em> when they arrive in Frenchman's Bend. Through cunning and shady dealing, Flem schemes his way from clerking in a country store to being President of the Sartoris bank in Jefferson. In his progress through the volumes of the trilogy he marries the mythically beautiful Eula Varner, but ""the only thing he loved was money"" (159). He even, as Montgomery Ward Snopes puts it, ""parlayed his wife into the presidency of a bank"" (92), a reference to Flem's exploitation of the adulterous affair between Eula and Manfred de Spain developed in <em>The Town</em>. He is originally cast as ruthless and rapacious in <em>The Hamlet</em>, but in the later volumes of the trilogy Faulkner softens his edges a bit. Though Flem never entirely becomes sympathetic, his motivations become more human and more understandable. Most of all, Flem strives for prestige and respectability, neither of which are given to him on a plate as they are to the grand old families of Jefferson. Instead, he has to earn both money and respectability; as Faulkner describes, using Ratliff's vernacular voice, Flem must ""snatch and tear and scrabble both of them outen the hard enduring resisting rock"" (171). Though he is by far the wealthiest resident of Jefferson, he is not quite upper class, as he never has the respectability of the first families. Somewhat pitifully, ""nobody . . . had ever managed to sell Flem Snopes anything as amorphous as prestige"" (358). Paradoxically, his various attempts to imitate the South's traditional aristocratic class makes him ""the tory who had done more than any other man in Jefferson or Yoknapatawpha County either to repeal time back to 1900 at least"" (253).</p><br />","Murder","","","","","","","","","","","""Barn Burning"", ""By the People"", ""Centaur in Brass"", ""Lizards in Jamshyd’s Courtyard"", ""Spotted Horses"", As I Lay Dying, Flags in the Dust, The Hamlet, The Reivers , The Town","","","","","","Snopes, Flem","14366","Individual","","","","1","Flem Snopes","19051","Ab Snopes","controls substantial wealth","has influential social contacts (family, business, political)","SnopessInM",""

Ab's biography comes to an ambiguous conclusion 30 pages later, when Ratliff tells us that, unlike his son Flem and so many other members of the clan, ""old man Ab"" never moved to Jefferson: he ""had come no closer than that hill two miles out where you could jest barely see the [town's] water tank, where he taken the studs that day back about 1910 and hadn't moved since"" (169).  This probably refers to the episode in <em>The Town</em> that describes an irascible old Snopes who lives just outside Jefferson; in that earlier novel the man is identified as <em>either</em> Ab <em>or</em> his brother.  That episode involves a watermelon patch - what this reference means by ""the studs"" is not at all clear.  In any case, Ratliff's ""since"" suggests Ab is still alive at least in the late 1920s.</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","""Barn Burning"", ""My Grandmother Millard and General Bedford Forrest and the Battle of Harrykin Creek"", ""The Unvanquished"", ""Vendee"", The Hamlet, The Town, The Unvanquished","","","","","","Snopes, Ab","14605","Individual","","","","0","Ab Snopes","19047","","","","SnopessInM",""

The story is most interested in another group - the (white) people of Yoknapatawpha as voters.  On the other hand, this entry refers to a group defined at the start of the story around the character of Ratliff: the ones who buy what he's selling as a salesman and the ones who enjoy listening to him as a raconteur.  We could call these the (white) people of Yoknapatawpha as consumers.  This group is subdivided by location and gender.  As a salesman he demonstrates sewing machines and compact organs for ""ladies"" who, when they live in the county's rural areas, sit ""in a circle of chairs outside""  or, in town, sit in a ""parlor"" decorated with ""antimacassars"" and ""wax flowers"" (86).  As a ""man among men"" he is equally at home talking with ""squatting, whittling"" men sitting in front of a country store or with professionals and other salesman ""gathered along the banquette of the hotel"" (86).  Ratliff's ability to appeal to these people, across the various divisions of class and gender, is presented as a virtue.

Because they know what ""Devries's medal meant,"" veterans form an important element in the anti-Snopes coalition during the 1946 Congressional election (346).  The novel refers to the housing development that Flem creates and calls ""Eula Acres"" as ""a subdivision of standardized Veterans' Housing matchboxes"" because so many of the new residents are ex-G.I.'s and ex-Marines (366).

In its account of Devries' political campaign against Clarence Snopes, the novel suggests that the young men who had gone overseas to fight the war were coming back without either the innocence or the prejudices they had before they left the county, and their more enlightened view can make a difference at the polls.

According to the text, for example, ""not just the town but the county came too"" to Flem Snopes's funeral (461).  In these references readers get some idea of the average living conditions for Faulkner's rural characters.  For example, the narrative compares the modern and lavish conditions at the renovated Bacchus plantation - ""electric light and steam heat and running water"" - with the lot of ""a lot of the rest of us,"" who ""still depended on coal oil lamps for light and our wives to tote firewood and water from the nearest woodlot and spring or well"" (218).  But <em>The Mansion</em> covers a long span of time, half of the 20th century, and includes several indications of what would conventionally be called progress, such as the ""small electric-driven corn-mill"" that appears two hundred pages later in the novel (407).  The novel's representation of this rural population depends on a point of view that shifts between narrators and even characters.  Mink Snopes, for example, is very skeptical about the spirituality of the Christians in Frenchman's Bend who regularly go to church; to him, the women go ""to swap a mess of fried chicken,"" their husbands go because they don't trust either the preacher or their wives together, while ""the young folks"" are looking for ways ""to be the first couple behind the nearest handy thicket-bush"" (6).  The account in Chapter 13 of Clarence Snopes' political success casts a dark shadow over the idea that democracy is the best form of government, and explicitly exposes and condemns white Southern racism.  Gavin Stevens, however, is on friendly social terms with ""the country men who had elected him to his office"" (429), and as an itinerant salesman V.K.

Sutpen tells General Compson that her mother ""had been a Spaniard"" (203), but later tells his son Henry that in fact she was ""part negro"" (283), which is the reason why Sutpen felt he had to divorce her.

Mr. Compson calls her ""the octoroon mistress"" (75), Bon's ""eighth part negro mistress"" (80), and ""a hereditary negro concubine"" (168).  Shreve (who as a non-Southerner is unfamiliar with the caste term ""white trash,"" 147) refers to her as ""the octoroon"" (249, 286).  (According to the racial categories once in widespread use, an ""octoroon"" is someone with seven white and one black great-grandparents.)  Most of the published scholarship on the novel follows Mr. Compson and identifies this character as ""the octoroon mistress,"" but that is an interpretive, not to say racially loaded choice.  If she and Bon were married, she is his wife.  The novel repeatedly refers to a wedding ""ceremony,"" often qualifying that noun with the adjective ""morganatic"" (80) - usually meaning a marriage between spouses of different social ranks in which no claim can be made on the property or title of the more highly ranked spouse; in the novel, apparently meaning a wedding between two different races, which would not have been a legal marriage in Louisiana or Mississippi.  But if both Bon and this woman are part 'black,' there's no legal barrier to the marriage, or to granting the woman the title Mrs. Bon, as our representation of her does.  Her character is just as problematic as her name.  Almost all references to her are attributable to Mr. Compson.  His depiction of her relies on stereotypical associations of her 'blackness' with the trope of the tragic mulatto and the sexualized black body.  He says she has ""a face like a tragic magnolia, the eternal female, the eternal Who-suffers"" (91); her ""white blood"" gives ""the shape and pigment to what the white man calls beauty,"" while her blackness links her to ""the hot equatorial groin of the world"" that pre-dates ""that white one of ours"" (92).  Mrs. Bon does come to Yoknapatawpha once, at Judith's invitation.  The description of her during her visit to Bon's grave is also provided by Mr. Compson, who calls her ""the magnolia-faced woman a little plumper now, a woman created by and for darkness"" (157).  Yet there is no evidence that Mr. Compson (or any of the novel's other storytellers) ever sees her in person, and these 'descriptions' may tell us more about him than her.  Not even the photograph of her and their son that Bon carries is described in any detail.  Shreve says he substituted it for Judith's as a signal to the white woman that ""I was no good"" (287), another interpretive act.  Like the phrase ""octoroon mistress,"" however, that is by no means the only way to understand her role in the story that the novel is telling.</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bon, Mrs. Charles|Octoroon Mistress","15455","Individual","","","","0","Mrs. Charles Bon","18935","","","","SutpensInAA",""

He spends part of this time shirtless - ""his naked torso pink-gleaming and baby-smooth, cherubic, almost hairless, the twin moons of his spectacles glinting against his moonlike rubicund face"" (147); in the bathrobe and overcoat he later puts on, he ""looks huge and shapeless like a disheveled bear"" (235).

He teases Quentin about the South (""It's better than the theatre, isn't it,"" 176), but has real concern for the effect of the past on Quentin.  From the Canadian province of Alberta (208), Shreve says that history is ""something my people haven't got"" (289), and in some respects he provides an outside perspective on the intensely Southern story: he is described at one point listening to Quentin ""with intent detached speculation and curiosity"" (206).  But what he and Quentin share, especially as youths, often produces moments of almost mystical communion between them and (apparently) with the past, especially with the two young men in the story, Henry and Bon, who of course meet at college too.

What the novel does show about Judith's life, however, testifies to her emotional and psychological strength: the girl who could stoically watch her father wrestling with his slaves becomes the woman who can keep up the failing plantation while her father is away at the war, who invites the woman she thinks was her fiance's mistress to visit the grave she made for him, and who, a ""unwived widow"" (110), adopts the orphan son of her murdered fiance and does the best she can to help him escape his vexed inheritance.

No examples of her poetry are given, but her prose narrative of Sutpen, Bon and the others is couched in the melodramatic terms of fairy tales or morality plays, with Sutpen cast as the ""demon"" outsider (4) who destroys an Old South she imagines as edenic, or at least locates in a ""garden"" (115).  When Mr. Compson takes up the narrative next, one of his first acts is to impeach her version of the story, and when the narrative is re-started in a Harvard dorm room, Shreve mocks her and her preconceptions by referring frequently to ""Aunt Rosa"" and ""the demon"" (143, 145).  As the third-person narrator notes still later, however, the ""best of ratiocination"" is ""after all a good deal like . . . Miss Coldfield's demonising"" (225).  As with the other storytellers, it is important for readers to decide for themselves how much her version reveals about the story, and how much it says about herself.</p><br />","Old Age","","","","","","","","","","Yoknapatawpha","","","","","","","Coldfield, Rosa","15465","Individual","","","","0","Rosa Coldfield","22506","Goodhue Coldfield;Mrs. Coldfield(2)","","","","Saturday, January 8, 1910"

As one of the county's earliest, and certainly its largest planter, and a Confederate Colonel during the Civil War, he has a lot in common with John Sartoris, the man who represented the Old South's plantation aristocracy in Faulkner's first Yoknapatawpha fiction. At the start of the war, Sartoris and Sutpen work together to raise and lead the Confederate regiment that fights in Robert E. Lee's army. However, just as Sutpen takes Sartoris' place in command of that regiment, so the story of Thomas Sutpen affords a much more searching look than the Sartoris saga at the cultural issues of class, race and slavery - issues that are largely taken for granted in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>. It is a story that is told retrospectively, from almost half a century after his death, one that changes dramatically depending upon who is telling it. To Rosa Coldfield, for example, Sutpen is ""fiend blackguard and devil"" (10), the outsider on whom the defeat of the South can be blamed. Wash Jones sees him at different moments as both the redeemer he worships and the ""instrument"" of his ""despair and grief"" (232). Quentin Compson raises the novel's implicit question when he wonders if it took ""Thomas Sutpen to make all of us"" (210). One part of the story - of the ""innocent"" (178) young Sutpen's ""fall"" into the Old South (180) - he apparently tells himself, though it reaches the reader as it is passed on by Quentin's grandfather to his father, by this father to Quentin, and by Quentin himself to Shreve. As the absent embodiment of the past, Sutpen himself remains both indeterminate and inescapable. Sutpen's design, to revenge himself upon the plantation aristocracy by creating an aristocratic dynasty of his own, fails - tragically, or ironically, or perhaps even justly. But his legacy remains to haunt the characters who inherit his story.</p><br />","Murder","","","","","","","","","","Virginia","""Appendix: Compson"", ""Wash"", Flags in the Dust, Go Down, Moses, Requiem for a Nun, The Reivers , The Unvanquished","","","","","","Sutpen, Thomas","15469","Individual","","","","1","Thomas Sutpen","18923","Thomas Sutpen's Mother;Thomas Sutpen's Father","","","SutpensInAA","Thursday, August 12, 1869"

He is one of the four people who tell various parts of the story of Thomas Sutpen and his family in the attempt to reconstruct the past, but even more pervasively he is the listener to the stories the others tell in the novel's two different 'presents': a hot afternoon and night in Mississippi in September 1909 (Chapters 1-4) and a cold Massachusetts night in January 1910 (Chapters 5-9).  His most direct connection to Sutpen, as his father explains, is as the grandson of the man, General Compson, who was Sutpen's ""only friend"" (220), but his deepest connection to the story is as ""Quentin Compson, the southerner"" (276), ""born and bred in the deep South"" (4), whose ""being"" is ""a barracks filled with stubborn back-looking ghosts"" (7).  ""Twenty years old"" (7), he is described physically as ""fragile and wan"" (236), and psychologically as ""morose and delicate"" (276).  ""Having to listen"" (4) is for him an ordeal: ""I have heard too much,"" he thinks, long before he hears the worst; ""I have been told too much; I have had to listen too much, too long"" (168).  In the course of <em>his</em> story Quentin does get inside ""the haunted house"" (174) - the old Sutpen mansion - to confront one of its ghosts in person, but no exorcism occurs.  He and Shreve seem to get much further than anyone else toward knowing what happened in the past, but the anguished note the novel ends on makes it clear how far Quentin remains from making peace with his southern ""heritage"" (7).  And as readers of Faulkner's earlier novel <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, where Quentin is also a major character, already knew when Faulkner published <em>Absalom!</em>, the dark night Quentin spends in his Harvard ""sitting-room"" wrestling with the legacy of Thomas Sutpen is not just ""five months"" (23) after the day when the first half of this novel occurs; it is also almost exactly five months before the day in the earlier novel when Quentin leaves that dorm room to commit suicide.</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","Yoknapatawpha","""A Justice"", ""Appendix: Compson"", ""Lion"", ""That Evening Sun"", The Mansion, The Sound and the Fury","","","","","","Compson, Quentin","15470","Individual","","","","0","Quentin Compson III","18887","Mr. Compson","","","CompsonsInAA",""

This group, according to the omniscient narrator, ""would confound forever seething with motion and motion with progress"" (4).  When they first lay out the plan of the courthouse and the town on the uncleared ground under a ""grove of oaks,"" the settlers themselves have a vision of the ""lawyers and doctors and dentists"" and others who will someday live around the as-yet-unbuilt Square (31).  Less respectable are the men whom the narrator refers to as ""white-skinned rascals and demagogues and white supremacy champions"" who are among the men elected to office by black voters as well as white (38), and the ""county fathers"" who scheme to tear down and replace the courthouse (38).  In the last part of the novel, the narrative refers to several more examples of these modern inhabitants further: the ""high school students"" who remember the Governor who spent time in the jail (196); the ""new people in the town"" at mid-century - ""strangers, outlanders"" who live in small modern houses in ""new subdivisions"" (196).  On the other hand, the current population also includes what the narrator calls ""the irreconcilable Jeffersonians and Yoknapatawphians"" (198), older inhabitants who remain estranged from the modern elements of the town and loyal to such ""obsolescent"" things as ""wood-burning ranges and cows and vegetable gardens"" (197).</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Unnamed Inhabitants of Modern Jefferson","18811","Group","","","","0","Unnamed Inhabitants of Modern Jefferson","20915","","","","",""

In the prose section of Act III, the novel develops his story in a bit more detail: he trades a race horse to Ikkemotubbe ""for a square of land"" (169), becoming one of the county's largest planters; he also becomes the partner of Ratcliffe in owning the settlement's store (173).   This prose section also gives him a first name: Jason (169), and identifies him as the father of ""General Compson, the first Jason's son"" (187).   There are two inconsistencies here that cannot be resolved.  Except for the later date of his arrival, Jason I's place as the first Mississippi Compson is the same in the ""Appendix Compson"" (1946): there, in 1811 Jason arrives in Yoknapatawpha and swaps a racehorse with Ikkemotubbe to acquire his square mile of land.  But elsewhere Faulkner identifies other members of the family as the first Compson.  In <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> it is clearly General Compson himself, Jason II, who is the family founder.  In <em>The Mansion</em> (1960), published 9 years after <em>Requiem</em>, it is Quentin Compson in 1821 who arrives first, and he acquires the property from the Mahataha (Ikkemotubbe's mother); it is this man, Quentin II, the great-grandfather of the Quentin in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (1929), who is General Compson's father everywhere else.  (Note how in <em>The Mansion</em> Faulkner has changed the spelling of ""Mohataha,"" as she is named in this novel [17], another reminder of how many inconsistencies he leaves unresolved in his world.)</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","""Appendix: Compson""","","","","","","Compson, Jason","18835","Individual","","","","0","Jason Compson I","18883","","","","CompsonsInRQ",""

Besides getting married at the end of the story, he has an affair with Miss Cayley, a young woman from a neighboring farm.

(It's worth noting that despite what Mr. Compson seems confidently to predict, the narrative goes on to acknowledge that Rosa's actions do not conform to this stereotype.)</p><br />","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Unnamed Southern Lady","24508","Individual","","","Created by a Character in Text","0","Unnamed Southern Lady","24506","","","","",""
