"19625","<a href=""/content/gibsonfamily"">GibsonFamily</a>","<p>The last name of the Gibson family only appears once in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, the novel where they first appear: when Dilsey is addressed as ""Sis Gibson"" by other black members of the church she attends on Easter (290).  Gibsons from three generations appear in a total of five Yoknapatawpha fictions, but like the Strothers family in Faulkner's various accounts of the Sartorises, this black African American family is almost exclusively defined in the context of the white family whom they serve.  For the Gibsons, that's the Compsons.  Dilsey is old enough to have been born a slave, and the cabin behind the Compsons' big house where she and her children live in four of those five fictions most  probably was originally part of the Compson plantation slave quarters.  However, except for one reference to a story she told her son Versh about how Grandfather Compson changed the name of a slave back in the ""old time"" (69), Faulkner does not trace the Gibson's lineage further back than the childhood of the four Compson children who are at the center of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>.  Dilsey's three children - Versh, Frony and T.P. - are about the same age as those Compsons.  In various groupings, all of them reappear under their first names in at least one more text.  Note: our chart assumes that the man Dilsey refers to in the 1929 novel when she threatens Luster - ""You just wait till your pappy come home"" (59) - is not the same man that Faulkner refers to in the 1946 ""Appendix Compson"" when he updates Luster's mother's biography with the fact that Frony ""married a pullman porter and went to St Louis to live"" (343).  But this is an assumption.  Faulkner may have been thinking of these two men as one character.</p>

"19631","<a href=""/content/strotherfamily"">StrotherFamily</a>","<p>The two oldest members of this family - Joby and Louvinia - came from Carolina to Mississippi as slaves of John Sartoris.  With two exceptions, they and their descendants serve the Sartorises loyally, as slaves before the Civil War and servants afterward, for five generations and in 3 novels and 9 short stories.  Simon Strothers appears in the first chapter of the first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  Joby and Louvinia's grandson (in one novel) or their son (in another), Simon lives his entire life in the cabin his family first occupied as slaves, and connects the antebellum era with the 20th century: in <em>Flags</em> (1929) he recalls the days of slavery nostalgically; at the end of <em>The Unvanquished</em> (1938) he is last seen wearing a ragtag Confederate uniform and grieving for Colonel Sartoris.  The two exceptions to this pattern are among Faulkner's few openly rebellious African American characters.  In <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Joby's son Loosh eagerly awaits the arrival of the Union army at Sartoris; after showing the troops where the plantation's silver is buried, he emancipates himself and his wife by going off with them.  In <em>Flags</em>, Simon's son Caspey returns from serving in the U.S. army during the First World War to proclaim ""I dont take nothin' offen no white man no mo'.""  Before the end of these texts, however, both quietly resume their places in both the family and their racially prescribed roles.</p>
<p>Overall the Strothers' condition across all five generations seems to confirm the Southern cliche that on the old plantations even the blacks were treated as members of an extended (white) family.  Rosa Millard, for example, John Sartoris' mother-in-law, tells her grandson Bayard that her money-making efforts are ""for all of us, for John, and you, and Ringo and Joby and Louvinia.""  The Ringo she mentions may in fact be a member of the family biologically.  He appears as both a slave and a major character in multiple short stories, where neither of Ringo's parents are identified.  Bayard, the narrator of the stories, notes that Ringo calls Rosa ""'Granny' just like I did.""  These details foster the suspicion that he could be John Sartoris' mixed-race, illegitimate son.  When Faulkner revised the stories for publication in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, he makes it explicit in the first chapter that Ringo is both Louvinia's grandson and ""Simon's son""; even there, however, Ringo's mother is never mentioned.  And in one case, or at least in one text, the familial metaphor is literalized.  In <em>Flags</em>, Simon's daughter Elnora is described (without elaboration) as ""a tall mulatto.""  In ""There Was a Queen,"" when the narrator notes that Bayard is ""her half-brother,"" we learn the identity of her one white parent: he is Colonel Sartoris - although she herself refers to her father as ""old Marse John,"" and still lives in that former slave cabin behind the big house, serving the Sartorises as both a cook and a kind of guardian of the white family's aristocratic greatness.</p>
<p>Set against the consistency of the black family's loyalty, Faulkner's own cavalier attitude toward their history across the course of the fictions is striking.  Simon is variously identified as Joby's grandson and his son.  Caspey is both Elnora's brother and her husband.  Elnora has either one or three children.  Loosh and Philadelphy appear in the one post-<em>Unvanquished</em> story that Bayard narrates as Lucius and Philadelphia.  You can trace these inconsistencies from text to text on the genealogical charts.</p>

"19644","<a href=""/content/sartorisfamily"">SartorisFamily</a>","<p>In the very beginning, Faulkner was going to create a novel about the Snopeses, but after starting that his imagination was taken over instead by the Sartorises.  If the poor-white but upwardly mobile Snopeses represent what Faulkner found wrong with the ""new,"" 20th century South, the culturally dispossessed, aristocratic Sartorises can be seen, at least at first, as a kind of monument to the greatness of the Old South, and a Modernist symbol of loss, like the exiled Russian aristocrat Marie with whom T.S. Eliot begins <em>The Waste Land</em>.  For her the violent agent of loss was the Russian Revolution; for the Sartorises it is two equally violent events, the Civil War and World War I.  Sartorises fought and died in both of them.  Even though they were on the winning side in 1918, like so many Lost Generation anti-heroes they found that victory did not prevent the destruction of the values they were supposed, as American aristocrats, to embody, or give them a home in the world to which they could return.  Sartorises appear in more novels and stories than any of the other recurring families, though Faulkner's primary focus is the generational succession of males.  These are mostly named John or Bayard, to the confusion of many readers, a confusion that Faulkner compounds when in some novels he refers to the Bayard who never fought in a war as ""Colonel Sartoris,"" a name that most of the time refers to his father.  Neither Colonel John Sartoris' first wife nor his daughters are ever given names.  On the other hand, several of the women on the family tree - Rosa Millard, Jenny Du Pre, Drusilla Hawk - are among Faulkner's most memorable characters.   Colonel John, the legendary first member of the family in Yoknapatawpha, appears in 21 texts - more than any other character.  He is dead in almost two thirds of them, but his legacy as a founding father of both the family and the county provides Faulkner with one of the most dramatic ways to demonstrate that, as he famously put it, ""the past is never dead.""</p>

"19647","<a href=""/content/sutpenfamily"">SutpenFamily</a>","<p>The multi-generational, racially complex family that Thomas Sutpen begets - five children with four different women - is at the center of one of Faulkner's major novels: <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> (1936), where Faulkner uses it to explore the problematic history of the Old South and its racial legacy.  Sutpen himself arrives in Yoknapatawpha in the early 1830s; <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> lists him along with the county's oldest, most prominent, upper class white families: ""Sartoris and Stevens, Compson and McCaslin and Sutpen"" (8).  But the place occupied by this family in the larger Yoknapatawpha narrative is considerably smaller than those others.  Faulkner first wrote about Sutpen, his second wife, and two of his children in the unpublished short story ""Evangeline"" in the early 1930s.  Sutpens first appear in print in 1934, in the short story ""Wash."" After <em>Absalom!</em>, except for a brief reference in <em>The Unvanquished</em> (1938) to Sutpen’s son and to his ""daughter's fiance"" (222) - who as readers of <em>Absalom!</em> know is also Sutpen's son - the other members of Sutpen's family disappear from the fiction.  The family name appears most of the lists Faulkner made of the county's major families; see ""Appendix Compson,"" <em>Requiem</em> and <em>The Town</em>.  Sutpen himself is mentioned in four later works, including Faulkner's last novel, <em>The Reivers</em> (1962), but not one of his wives, mistresses or descendants - which, given his own ambition to found a dynasty, seems deeply ironic.  Faulkner's fiction is full of such ironies, but this erasure of the rest of the family can also be read as a kind of exorcism of the dark story they tell about the southern past.</p>

"19655","<a href=""/content/benbowfamily"">BenbowFamily</a>","<p>In the context of Faulkner's career, the Benbows are one of Yoknapatawpha's very 'first families,' along with the Snopeses and the Sartorises.  In 1927 or 1928, when he put aside the ""Father Abraham"" manuscript about the rise of the Snopeses in the New South to write <em>Flags in the Dust</em> about the displacement of the county's old aristocracy, he divided the novel's focus between young Bayard Sartoris and Horace Benbow, descended respectively from planters and lawyers.  Over the course of his career Faulkner's imagination returned much more often to the Sartorises and the Snopeses, but as the protagonist of <em>Sanctuary</em> (1931) Horace Benbow is actually the first recurring major character in his canon .  Horace and his sister Narcissa are the third or fourth generation of Benbows in Yoknapatawpha.  The house where they live in 20th-century Jefferson was built in the 1840s ""by an English architect,"" establishing the family's place both chronologically and socially among the county's antebellum founders (163).  The novel refers briefly to their parents, Will and Julia, and to an earlier ancestor named Francis, who returned to town from Barbados in 1871 (164).  Later fictions refer to a Judge Benbow; we are assuming he is Francis' father and the man for whom the house was built, but he could be Francis himself.  Yet compared to the care with which Faulkner identifies the various Sartorises over the same historical span, the story of the Benbows is gestured to rather than told.  That they live in town, that the earliest ancestor is a Judge, that Horace practices law in his father's law office, that while the family owned slaves no Benbow is said to have served during the Civil War - all these details distinguish them from Sartorises, Compsons, McCaslins and Sutpens, but don't tell us much about the family on its own terms.</p>
<p>The most developed relationship is the sibling one between Horace and Narcissa, which in <em>Flags</em> is so close and conflicted as to suggest the idea of incest.  They go down different paths, however.  Horace marries a woman whose pretensions are aristocratic but whose origins are bourgeois and whose behavior is identified with the New rather than the Old South.  Narcissa marries Bayard.  This class-appropriate marriage could be seen as providing a future for both families, and that is clearly what Narcissa has in mind when she names the child who is born at the end of <em>Flags</em> ""Benbow Sartoris.""  Along with his mother, he is living on the Sartoris plantation in <em>Sanctuary</em> and ""There Was a Queen"" (1933), a short story in which Faulkner returns to wrap up elements of <em>Flags</em>.  But after that, except for a few passing references to Judge Benbow, a Percy Benbow, Narcissa and Benbow Sartoris, Faulkner drops the family almost completely.  And as far as the Yoknapatawpha saga goes, Benbow Sartoris is the last of both the Benbows and the Sartorises.</p>

"19656","<a href=""/content/compsonfamily"">CompsonFamily</a>","<p>For <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, his second Yoknapatawpha fiction, Faulkner creates a third aristocratic family: the Compsons.  Their social credentials are even more impressive than the Sartorises - according to Quentin Compson, at least, ""one of our forefathers was a governor and three were generals"" (101); although only one General ever appears in the nineteen fictions with Compsons in them, he outranks all the Colonels and Majors in the other stories.  The family's first appearance foregrounds the 20th century descendants of these men, and in some respects Faulkner deploys them to create the same contrast as in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> between the great past and the sordid present.  But in the novel the past that matters most is personal, not cultural: <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> is one of Faulkner's two greatest dramatizations of the family itself as an environment, of the way individuals are shaped by their familial experiences with parents and siblings (the other is his next novel, <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, where the family is poor white but the psychological issues are much the same).</p>
<p>Although the Compson who appears most frequently is the General, the most important member of the family is his grandson Quentin.  He dies in that first novel, but Faulkner resurrects him in three stories - ""That Evening Sun,"" ""A Justice"" and ""Lion"" - where as narrator Quentin provides access to cultural spaces that are far removed from the big houses of the plantation aristocracy: a black servant's cabin, an Indian's tribal past, and the big woods that can seem outside time itself, whether measured in historical or Freudian terms.  And in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, as the point of view around which the novel is organized, Quentin simultaneously confronts his own familial and the Southern past, and the profound interrelationship between them.</p>

"19657","<a href=""/content/ikkemotubbefamily"">IkkemotubbeFamily</a>","<p>There is one family in the Indian tribe that lives in Yoknapatawpha which recurs in Faulkner's fiction.  As a family, it is mainly defined in terms that can be called political.  According to Faulkner's representation of Indian culture, the male head of that family is also ""The Man"" - the chief of the tribe, who is also ""the hereditary owner"" of the tribal lands and slaves and can sell or trade these commodities to the white settlers who have already begun arriving in the area (""Red Leaves,"" 317).  As in a European aristocracy, the title passes from father to eldest son, although as in many Elizabethan plays, for example, there are impatient sons and ambitious nephews who use violence to usurp it.  The conflict between these males around keeping or gaining power is the basis for most of the familial interactions depicted in the sixteen texts in which the family appears, though throughout this is conceived ironically, against the Indians' inevitable 'removal' by the American government to territory west of the Mississippi.<br />
Over the course of those sixteen texts, the family story comes to center mainly on the character Ikkemotubbe, or ""Doom.""  The ambitious son of the sister of the chief, Ikkemotubbe becomes The Man by killing and intimidating his relatives.  But the details of the story are inconsistent.  When Faulkner first tells it, in ""Red Leaves,"" The Man is only referred to by his title, and Issetibbeha is Doom's son.  In all but two of the stories, however, that first chief, Doom's uncle, is Issetibbeha.  Thus it has seemed best to identify the family name with both Issetibbeha and Ikkemotubbe, and to create a pair of side-by-side genealogical charts for the familial template.  ""Tree 1"" represents the generations as they appear in the two first ""Indian stories,"" ""Red Leaves"" and ""A Justice,"" published 1930-31.  ""Tree 2"" shows the generational sequence as it appears later, beginning with ""Lion"" in 1935.<br />
And this is only one of the many ways in which the family is reconceived in different texts.  Originally, for example, the story of Had-Two-Fathers, the mythic Sam Fathers of Faulkner's hunting fictions, is not part of the Ikkemotubbe|Issetibbeha family history.  Even when Sam is added to the family tree, his place on it repeatedly changes: it takes Faulkner a while to decide if he is the son or the grandson of a Chickasaw chief; it is only in his sixth (and most famous) appearance - in the novel <em>Go Down, Moses</em> - that Sam's mother is made a ""quadroon,"" making Sam himself genetically more ""white"" than ""black.""  Faulkner returns to some version of the family history even in his last five Yoknapatawpha novels.  In two of them the ""Man"" has become a 'woman': the apparent leader of the tribe is the matriarch Mohataha, identified as Ikkemotubbe's mother (and based on a historical Chickasaw leader named Hoka).</p>

"19658","<a href=""/content/maccallumfamily"">MacCallumFamily</a>","<p>In both <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (1929) and <em>As I Lay Dying</em> (1930), Faulkner spells the family name ""MacCallum.""  When he brings them back a decade later - first in <em>The Hamlet</em> (1940), then five other texts - it's ""McCallum.""  But the role the family plays in the Yoknapatawpha saga remains constant.  To use the term that Faulkner inherits from Southern culture, they are yeomen.  They live about fifteen miles northeast of Jefferson, in a rugged setting that seems to provide a refuge from the vices of both the plantation South with its aristocrats and slaves and the modern South with its Snopeses.  The family is entirely male: the family patriarch - Virginius in <em>Flags</em> and Old Anse in ""The Tall Men"" (1941) - has five or six children, all sons.  The women in the family are not mentioned in six of the eight texts where MacCallum|McCallums appear, and in the other two, <em>all</em> the women on the family tree (a total of four wives) are dead.  The family values passed on from fathers to sons are the traditionally masculine virtues of courage, loyalty, independence.  The men are farmers, hunters, horsemen, and most quintessentially soldiers.  As a young man at the start of the Civil War, the patriarch walks from Mississippi to Virginia to fight on the soil the family originally came from.  Half a century later his youngest son, Buddy, is decorated for valor fighting in the trenches of the First World War.  Two decades later still, Buddy's twin sons Anse and Lucius are ready to report for duty at the start of World War II.</p>
<p>One curious aspect of the place the MacCallums occupy in the Yoknapatawpha canon is its relationship to the place of the McCaslins, the upper-class family of slave-owners and landlords at the center of the novels <em>Go Down, Moses</em> (1942) and, in the family's extended branches, <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> (1948) and <em>The Reivers</em> (1962).  On the two maps of Yoknapatawpha that Faulkner himself drew, the families literally occupy the same place in the county's northeastern corner: the MacCallums on the first (1936) and the McCaslins on the second (1946).  The patriarchs have similarly latinate names: Virginius and Lucius Quintus.  In both families there is an interest in interbreeding foxes and foxhounds. And there is even a ""Lucius"" in the youngest generation of MacCallums.  It's not clear that Faulkner consciously created these similarities, but in any case if the MacCallum|McCallums represent a Southern tradition that needs to be perpetuated, the McCaslin legacy is so morally comprised that the grandson of Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin renounces it.</p>
","MacCallum|McCallum Family","","MacCallum Family Biography",""
"19659","<a href=""/content/mccaslinfamily"">McCaslinFamily</a>","<p>Faulkner had already created the Sartorises, the Compsons and the Sutpens when he decided to add a fourth planter family to the census of Yoknapatawpha.  Eventually the McCaslins become the largest of them all, with more than sixty members.  They don't come into focus as a <em>family</em> until <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, a novel published in 1942, and the complex process, as much moral as imaginative, by which different characters, white and black, move toward each other in various stories over the previous decade is one of the most fascinating aspects of Faulkner's career.  The story Faulkner uses the family to tell when 38 McCaslins, Beauchamps and Edmondses (all three branches of the extended family) come together in <em>Moses</em> is similar to his use of the Sutpens in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> - representing  Southern history as a family affair - but the access the McCaslins provide to the darker parts of slavery and the sins of the planter aristocracy deconstructs the earlier image created by Sartorises and Compsons in ways that can seem still more powerful.  And unlike the Sutpens, the McCaslins don't effectively disappear in the later fictions.  Faulkner's very last novel, <em>The Reivers</em>, published twenty years after <em>Moses</em>, centers again on the McCaslin family, which Faulkner here extends along an entirely new branch, the Priests.  On the other hand, after <em>Moses</em> Faulkner does effectively erase the darkest parts of the McCaslin story while also making the family increasingly ""white.""  You can trace this long and winding narrative arc through the charts of the 22 works in which one or more members of the family appear.</p>
<p>There is another possible inter-textual and -familial aspect to the family, one that the genealogical charts available here don't attempt to represent.  The roots of the McCaslin family tree may reach as far back as the MacCallum family, from Faulkner's very first Yoknapatawpha fiction.  The two families live in almost exactly the same place in northeast Yoknapatawpha, as a comparison of Faulkner's 1936 map (where it's the McCallums' place that appears) with his 1945 map (where it's the McCaslins') will show.  The families' patriarchs are named Virginius and Lucius Quintus.  When readers are introduced into the families' homes, they find foxes intermingled with foxhounds.  How the families are or aren't linked in Faulkner's texts or in his mind, and how differently they represent an idea of the ""Old South,"" readers may choose to explore for themselves.</p>

"19660","<a href=""/content/snopesfamily"">SnopesFamily</a>","<p>The Snopeses are the largest family in Faulkner's world: altogether at least 67 different Snopeses appear in twenty-one different fictions, including the three long novels (<em>The Hamlet</em>, <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>) written as parts of a Snopes trilogy that Faulkner planned and worked on for decades.  Snopeses haunted his imagination from the mid-1920s, when he started the earliest Yoknapatawpha fiction, titled ""Father Abraham,"" to tell the story of Flem Snopes' rise from poor white sharecropper's son to Jefferson bank president, through the early-1960s, when he worked with his publisher to bring out <em>Snopes: A Trilogy</em> in one volume.  Faulkner regularly talked about ""Snopesism"" as the demographic symptom of the decline of the Old South into the local version of Modernist decay, much as T.S. Eliot uses Sweeney in his poetry from the 1920s.  Faulkner told an approving audience at Virginia in 1958, for example, that there was ""not any sort of shoddiness and sorriness and baseness that some Snopes wasn't capable of.""  On the other hand, among those 67 characters are many who are genuinely admirable, and most are imagined in the context of their individual stories as human beings rather than sociological distress signals.</p>
<p>After considerable discussion, it is the consensus of this project's collaborators and advisory editors that our genealogical display should not represent the Snopes family the same way we depict the other ten recurring families.  Half a dozen Snopes family trees have been created and published by other scholars, but even they would no doubt admit that it isn't possible to determine reliably who all the Snopeses are, nor how all of them are related to each other.  In the first novel in the trilogy, for example, the Snopes clan exposes the limits on the omniscient third-person narrator's 'omnisicence': he refers to I.O. as Flem's ""cousin (or whatever the relationship was: nobody ever knew for certain)"" (73).  Similar perplexities recur repeatedly across the texts; in the trilogy's second volume Gavin Stevens sums up the problem of a Snopes genealogy this way: ""they none of them seemed to bear any specific kinship to one another; they were just Snopeses, like colonies of rats or termites are just rats and termites"" (42). The Snopes themselves seldom define their kinship relations.  ""It's a funny thing about them Snopes,"" says the first-person narrator of ""Spotted Horses,"" ""they all looks alike, yet there ain't ere a two of them that claims brothers. They're always just cousins"" (180).  That's an exaggeration, but when, for instance, in the last book of the trilogy V.K. Ratliff presses Montgomery Ward to say whether Mink is ""your uncle or your cousin,"" all Mink says is ""Yeah?"" (71).  Obfuscating kinship connections among Snopeses may be one of Faulkner's ways to distinguish between them and the other major white families in his fiction, where the lineage of the aristocratic Sartorises or Compsons is much more clearly established.</p>
<p>The ""aggregate"" here makes no attempt to organize the 67 Snopeses into a 'tree' but instead sorts them into generations, an easier category to establish - though even here there may be overlap or error.  Text-by-text, on the other hand, the connections between husbands and wives (even when I.O. Snopes has two wives at the same time) and parents and children (even when a child is illegitimate) are much more definite, so as you click through the individual texts you'll see the horizontal and vertical lines between character icons that are missing in this collective representation.</p>

"19661","<a href=""/content/stevensfamily"">StevensFamily</a>","<p>According to the narrator of <em>Light in August</em> (1932), the Stevens family is ""old in Jefferson.""  In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> (1948), Chick Mallison, whose mother is a Stevens, sees the landscape of Yoknapatawpha as ""the dirt, the earth which had bred his bones and those of his fathers for six generations.""  Actually, if we count from the first Stevens to be born in Mississippi, Chick belongs to the fourth or at most the fifth generation, but in the short story ""Hand Upon the Waters"" (1939) Faulkner revises his usual account of Yoknapatawpha's settlement to include a Stevens along with a Holston and a Grenier as one of the county's first three founding fathers.  On the other hand, the Stevens family emerges in the fictions a bit later than than the Sartorises, the Snopeses, the Compsons, or the Benbows.  They emerge, in fact, as a revision of sorts of the Benbow family: like the Benbows, they are lawyers and judges rather than planters or soldiers.</p>
<p>The first Stevens in Yoknapatawpha is only mentioned that one time, but the first Stevens in the Yoknapatawpha fictions appears early, in ""A Rose for Emily,"" as ""Judge Stevens,"" the 80-year-old mayor of Jefferson in the 1880s (122).  Some scholars (Brooks, Dasher, Kirk) assume this is the same ""Judge Stevens"" who is Gavin Stevens' father in more than half a dozen texts, but given his age, we (like Edmond Volpe) identify him as Gavin's grandfather, who is also mentioned in <em>Light in August</em> as having ""owned slaves"" before the Civil War (444).   Gavin is by far the most important member of the family.  He appears in seventeen different texts (in six of which he is the only Stevens present in the narrative).  From his first brief appearance in ""Hair"" (1931) through the major books of the Forties and Fifties, the place he occupies in Faulkner's imagination steadily grows.  He can be seen as a more effectual version of Horace Benbow; as Yoknapatawpha's county attorney, for example, he solves the six stories of crime and detection gathered in <em>Knight's Gambit</em> (1949).  The dynamics of the Stevens family raise issues that a different point in his career Faulkner might have wanted to explore: another echo of the Benbows is the fact that the unmarried middle-aged Gavin still lives in the house he grew up in with his married sister and her son, and his relationships with them both seem to usurp the place of Charles Mallison, the husband and father.  (Note how this displacement also occurs in Chick's reference to his ""fathers."")  But none of the twenty texts show any interest in delving into <em>those</em> kinds of mysteries.</p>
