"24529","3810","Unnamed Poor Whites Near Sutpen's Hundred","Unnamed Poor Whites Near Sutpen's Hundred","","<p>The ""clientele"" of the store that Sutpen opens after returning from the Civil War in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> includes blacks and whites from the area (147).  Shreve McCannon uses the derogatory term ""white trash"" to describe the white patrons, though his use of the term also indicates that it is one he wasn't familiar with as a Canadian: ""what is it? the word? white what? - Yes, trash"" (147).</p>","Yes"
"24527","3809","Unnamed Negroes Near Sutpen's Hundred","Unnamed Negroes Near Sutpen's Hundred","","<p>The ""clientele"" of the ""little crossroads store"" that Thomas Sutpen opens after the Civil War includes, according to Shreve McCannon, ""freed niggers"" who live in the area (147).  Shreve uses the adjective ""freed"" because the historical context is the immediate aftermath of the Civil War and Emancipation.  He uses that derogatory noun to describe these former slaves because Negroes are considered inferior - though it's interesting to note that in this same passage Shreve reveals how, as a Canadian, he is with the equally derogatory term ""white trash"" (147).  As the larger story of <em>Absalom, Absalom</em> tragically reveals, racism is more deeply rooted in the (white) psyche than class consciousness.</p>","Yes"
"24506","3808","Unnamed Southern Lady","Unnamed Southern Lady","","<p>Mr. Compson creates this profile of ""a Southern lady"" in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> while telling Quentin about Rosa Coldfield's behavior after her sister Ellen dies (68).  According to his misogynistic generalization, the ""Southern lady"" is ""like a vampire"" in the way she will feed herself and her idea of what she is entitled to off the lives of her relatives or in-laws (68).</p>","No"
"24501","3807","Unnamed Women Married by J.P.s","Unnamed Women Married by J.P.s","","<p>In the middle of describing Sutpen and Ellen's wedding in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> Mr. Compson interrupts his reconstruction to generalize about women who never had formal weddings: ""women who were married by tobacco-chewing j[ustices of the] p[eace]s in country courthouses or by ministers waked after midnight"" (37).  According to his misogynistic assertion, it is the longing of these women for a more ceremonial wedding that is the cause of ""most divorces"" (37).</p>","No"
"24493","3806","Unnamed Slave Buyers","Unnamed Slave Buyers","","<p>When Mr. Compson describes how Charles Bon initiates Henry Sutpen into the secrets of white male upper class life in New Orleans by taking him to the place where white-featured enslaved women are sold to men who will use them for sex, he describes the ""young men"" whom Henry sees with a series of adjectives: ""elegant,"" ""trim,"" ""predatory"" and ""(at the moment) goatlike"" (89).  Bon - or at least, Mr. Compson's version of Bon - later refers to this group as ""the thousand, the white men"" who ""made, created and produced"" the white-featured female slaves whom they purchase (91).</p>","No"
"24456","3805","Unnamed Fellow at De Spain's","Unnamed Fellow at De Spain's","","<p>Ratliff brings this ""fellow"" into <em>The Hamlet</em> in his account of how Ab Snopes burned De Spain's barn: according to this account, he bases his description of the rapid ""gait"" at which De Spain rode his horse from the barn to the cabin where Ab was living on this ""fellow who heard him passing in the road"" (19).  Throughout his account of Ab and De Spain (essentially a re-telling of the short story ""Barn Burning""), Ratliff describes events he did not witness firsthand, but this is the only point at which he explains how he 'knew' what happened.</p>","Yes"

"24427","3803","Unnamed European Princesses","Unnamed European Princesses","","<p>These ""heiresses to European thrones"" appear only inside a quasi-Homeric or mock-heroic simile when the narrator of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> compares Willy Ingrum, who moves to Jefferson from Beat Four, marries ""a town girl,"" and becomes the ""town marshal"" to the ""petty Germanic princelings [who] come down out of their Brandenburg hills to marry the heiresses to European thrones"" (133).  It's not clear if Faulkner is thinking of specific members of European royalty.</p>","No"
"24425","3802","Unnamed Germanic Princelings","Unnamed Germanic Princelings","","<p>In a kind of mock-Homeric simile, the narrator of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> compares the ""apostate sons of Beat Four"" in Yoknapatawpha who move into Jefferson and marry ""a town girl"" to the ""petty Germanic princelings [who] would come down out of their Brandenburg hills to marry the heiresses to European thrones"" (133).  It's not clear if Faulkner is thinking of any specific German noblemen.  (Brandenburg was a province of Prussia until Prussia was abolished after World War II, when Brandenburg became a separate German state.)</p>","No"
"24414","3801","Unnamed European Immigrants","Unnamed European Immigrants","","<p>During his lengthy monologue about race in Chapter 7 of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, Gavin Stevens refers with clear contempt to what he calls ""the coastal spew of Europe"" that lives in the urban, industrial North, an undefined group that he juxtaposes to ""the New Englander"" who lives ""back inland"" away from the cities on the coast (150).  The distinction is a hierarchical and even moral one: the traditional (i.e. ""Anglo-Saxon,"" a term Gavin uses earlier in the passage, 152) New Englander has been essentially overrun by this ""unrootable"" group from Europe, which explains why, in Gavin's mind, the ""homogeneous"" white South alone can defend the best values of American culture (150).</p>","No"
"24412","3800","Unnamed New Englanders","Unnamed New Englanders","","<p>This ""New Englander"" is different from the 'Yankees' and 'Northerners' that Gavin Stevens often disparages in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>.  During his lengthy monologue about race in Chapter 7, Gavin mentions ""the New Englander"" after telling his nephew that the white South, ""alone in the United States,"" is ""a homogeneous people""; he adds that this ""New Englander"" who lives ""back inland"" from the cities on the coast is also homogeneous, ""but there are no longer enough of him"" to preserve what, in Gavin's mind, the white South must defend (150).</p>","No"
"24410","3799","Unnamed Swiss","Unnamed Swiss","","<p>Gavin Stevens mentions ""the Swiss"" in passing during his lengthy monologue about race in Chapter 7 of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>: after telling his nephew that the white South, ""alone in the United States,"" is ""a homogeneous people,"" he compares them to the ""the Swiss"" - they too are homogeneous, but there are not ""enough"" of them to matter, adding that they ""are not a people so much as a neat clean quite solvent business"" (150).</p>","No"
"24402","3798","Unnamed Confederate Cavalry 5","Unnamed Confederate Cavalry 5","","<p>This is the ""party of horsemen"" mentioned by Lucius in <em>The Reivers</em> that was led by the brother of Nathan Bedford Forrest; they rode their horses ""into the lobby"" of the Gayoso Hotel in Memphis and, according to Lucius, ""almost captured a Yankee general"" (94).  Lucius does not say more about the cavalrymen, except that they included the Priest family's ""remote"" kinsman Theophilus McCaslin (94).</p>","Yes"
"24399","3797","Unnamed Jefferson Lawyers","Unnamed Jefferson Lawyers","","<p>These men appear <em>in absentia</em> in <em>The Mansion</em> as part of the explanation of how Otis Meadowfill ended up ""choosing [Gavin] Stevens from among the other Jefferson lawyers"" (367).  As a county seat and the site of a federal courthouse, Jefferson presumably had quite a number of lawyers throughout its history.</p>","Yes"
"24397","3796","Unnamed Italian Marble Syndicate","Unnamed Italian Marble Syndicate","","<p>Italian marble appears in Yoknapatawpha in 4 different Yoknapatawpha fictions: the marble tombstones Sutpen has made for himself and Ellen are imported from Italy in <em>Absalom!</em>; the marble columns for the rebuilt courthouse in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> are too; and so is the marble medallion that Gavin Stevens and Linda Snopes order for Eula's monument in <em>The Town</em>, or the monument itself, referred to as an ""outrageous marble lie"" <em>The Mansion</em> (460).  The only mention of the Italians behind these status symbols, however, occurs in <em>The Mansion</em>, which refers to ""the Italian marble syndicate"" as the only time someone had sold Flem ""anything as amorphous as prestige"" (358).  Whether ""marble syndicate"" includes the craftsmen who worked with the marble, or just to the executives who managed the transaction, isn't clear.</p>","No"
"24391","3795","Herbert Hoover","Hoover, Herbert","","<p>The real Herbert Hoover was the 31st President of the U.S. (1929-1933).  The ""Herbert Hoover"" who appears in <em>The Mansion</em>, however, is the creation of Gavin Stevens, who is trying to direct the Federal Bureau of Investigation. away from Linda Snopes Kohl by writing an anonymous letter to ""Herbert Hoover/F B & I Depment"" accusing Flem Snopes of having a ""commonist party Card"" (269).  The real head of the F.B.I. at the time, of course, was J. Edgar Hoover - no relation to Herbert - but Gavin's 'mistake' is part of his impersonation of an ""Patriotic Citizen"" who cannot spell (269).</p>","No"
"24389","3794","Unnamed Men Who Caused the World Wars","Unnamed Men Who Caused the World Wars","","<p>In Chapter 6 of <em>The Mansion</em>, Gavin Stevens refers to ""the same old cynical manipulators"" who had caused World War One and were now, in the late 1930s, about to start the Second World War: ""the parasites - the hereditary proprietors, the farmers-general of the human dilemma"" (178).  The specific names he mentions in the passage include Benito Mussolini, ""this one man"" in Germany (Adolph Hitler), Huey Long in Louisiana and ""our own Bilbo in Mississippi"" as well as two racist and anti-Semitic organizations: the ""K.K.K. and Silver Shirts"" (179).  V.K. Ratliff interrupts Gavin twice to try to get him to include ""the one in Russia"" - i.e. Joseph Stalin - on the list (179).  It's probably worth noting that the term ""parasites"" might be interpreted by some in Faulkner's time as a coded reference to Jewish financiers, who were actually often scapegoated as responsible for World War I, but all the names with which Gavin develops his indictment refers to men and organizations that were explicitly anti-Semitic.  They all have their own entries in this index.</p>","No"
"24386","3793","Unnamed Modern Aryans","Unnamed Modern Aryans","","<p>In a confused passage in <em>The Mansion</em> that evokes a number of stereotypes, mostly involving national types (like ""German,"" 146), Gavin Stevens asserts the idea of ""the modern virile northern Aryan"" to explain why he decided to participate in the First World War by serving on the allied side (146).  According to Gavin's idea, it was ""the old Aryan stock"" as embodied in the English that ""established America"" (146).  Exactly how he - or Faulkner - would define ""Aryan"" is not clear, but given the use of the term by Nazi Germany to exclude Jews from the idea of a 'master race,' it's an odd concept for Faulkner to introduce into the novel.  The concept of the ""Anglo-Saxon,"" which the narrator of the earlier <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> uses to describe the race of the pioneers, while still deployed in an exclusionary way, is not nearly as loaded a term.</p>","Yes"
"24384","3792","Unnamed Jews","Unnamed Jews","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Chick Mallison and his uncle Gavin have a conversation about the man Linda Snopes married; although neither of them ever once explicitly uses the word 'Jewish' or gives Chick's anti-Antisemitism a name, Gavin's insistence that Chick pronounce Linda's husband's name ""K-o-h-l"" rather than ""Cole"" leads Chick to wonder why Barton Kohl didn't change his name.  He adds ""dont they, usually?"" (122).  This comment provokes Gavin to wonder where his nephew ""found that"" - i.e. acquired this prejudice about 'them' (123).  Although Chick's ""they"" is a very insubstantial 'character' and Chick himself is ""ashamed"" of his attitude (123), it seems clear that ""they"" should be included in the fictions' cast of characters.</p>","No"
"24382","3791","Unnamed Suitor of Eula Varner","Unnamed Suitor of Eula Varner","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> V.K. Ratliff refers to ""some foreigner from four or six miles away"" from Frenchman's Bend who tried to court Eula Varner, but was ""bushwhacked"" by the local young men who put aside their rivalry long enough to drive away this outsider (131-32).  Ratliff may be citing a specific case, or something that has happened more than once before McCarron - another outsider - comes courting.</p>","Yes"
"24380","3790","Unnamed Wounded Male Soldiers","Unnamed Wounded Male Soldiers","","<p>As they wait for Linda Kohl to return from the Spanish Civil War in <em>The Mansion</em>, Chick Mallison reminds his uncle about the ""men soldiers"" from Yoknapatawpha who have ""come home wounded from a war"" (121).  The way he says it - ""Men soldiers yes, of course yes"" - suggests he is thinking mainly of Confederate soldiers and the Civil War, but the fictions include wounded veterans of the Spanish-American and the First World Wars.</p>","Yes"
"24365","3789","Unnamed Non-Mississippians","Unnamed Non-Mississippians","","<p>According to Gavin in <em>The Mansion</em>, ""the rest of the world, at least that part of it in the United States, rates us folks in Mississippi at the lowest rung of culture"" (167).  This entry represents those people outside Mississippi - especially in the North.</p>","No"
"24362","3788","Unnamed Negro Train Passengers 2","Unnamed Negro Train Passengers 2","","<p>These people don't appear in <em>The Reivers</em>, but their presence is evoked when the narrator sees Reba and Minnie at the Parsham depot getting out of ""the Jimcrow half"" of the smoking car - ""where Negroes traveled"" (194).</p>","No"
"24361","3787","Unnamed People of Frenchman's Bend 3","Unnamed People of Frenchman's Bend 3","","<p>The rural and poor hamlet of Frenchman's Bend appears or is referred to in 18 different Yoknapatawpha fictions; this entry focuses on one of the texts that characterizes the people who live there as a group. ""Centaur in Brass"" takes place after Flem Snopes comes to town, and doesn't provide a name for the place he comes from, though the references to the ""country store"" (149) and the auction of ""a herd of half-wild mustang ponies"" (150) identifies the place as the Bend.  The ""purchasers"" of the ponies are barely mentioned, but the narrative says enough to indicate their haplessness and ignorance (150).  One thing they remain ignorant about: the extent of Flem's involvement in the auction.</p>","Yes"
"24331","3786","Unnamed Negro Youngsters","Unnamed Negro Youngsters","","<p>When Joe Brown, in <em>Light in August</em>, asks the ""old negro woman"" sitting on the porch of her cabin about who lives there, she replies ""Aint nobody here but me and the two little uns"" (433-34).  She adds that these two children are ""too little"" to carry a message to town (434), but neither she nor the narrative say anything else about them.</p>","Yes"
"24268","3785","Unnamed Episcopal Bishop","Unnamed Episcopal Bishop","","<p>When Bayard remembers church services before the Civil War in ""The Unvanquished"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, he recalls that ""the bishop"" visited the church in Yoknapatawpha at least once; the bishop's official ring ""looked big as a pistol target"" (86, 137).  ""Episcopal"" as a word derives from the idea of bishops; in the hierarchy of the Episcopal religion, a Bishop would preside over churches spread across a large area.</p>","Yes"
"24207","3784","Unnamed College Professors 2","Unnamed College Professors 2","","<p>The narrator of ""Smoke"" notes, as part of his thumbnail description of Gavin Stevens, that he ""could discuss Einstein with college professors"" (17).  (In <em>Light in August</em> readers meet one of the college professors Gavin knows; see ""Unnamed College Professor."")</p>","Yes"
"24201","3783","Unnamed Judge 5","Unnamed Judge 5","","<p>The narrator of ""Smoke"" refers briefly to ""the presiding judge during court term"" when describing how one can gain entry into Judge Dukinfield's office (14).  It's not clear if this is a rotating or a permanent position.</p>","Yes"
"24169","3782","John Gilbert","Gilbert, John","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em>, Minnie notes that, although ""he aint no John Gilbert,"" Popeye is a ""right pretty little man"" (227).  Gilbert was one of the stars of the silent era in American movies.  His nickname was ""The Great Lover.""</p>","No"
"24167","3781","Unnamed Neighbor of Benbow","Unnamed Neighbor of Benbow","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Horace Benbow tells Ruby Lamar that she can ""always get me by telephone, at ------,"" and gives her ""the name of a neighbor"" that the narrative withholds from us (201).  This is that neighbor.  (In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> the Benbows' neighbors are named Wyatt; there's no obvious reason for Faulkner's coyness about the neighbor in this novel.)</p>","Yes"
"24135","3779","Unspecified Compson Ancestors","Compson, Unspecified Ancestors","","<p>In the ""Appendix, Compson:1699-1945"" that Faulkner wrote in 1946, seventeen years after The Sound and the Fury was first published, he traces the Compson patrimony all the way back to Scotland in the 18th century. The 1929 novel, however, contains only a few much vaguer references to the family history; Jason thinks, for example, about the ""governors and generals"" in the family past (230), and Quentin thinks that ""one of our forefathers was a governor and three were generals"" (101). It's likely that the Compson that Mr. Compson mentions as his father's ""father"" (76) was the governor. The Compson Quentin calls ""Grandfather"" (76) was a Confederate General, but we have no further information about the other two generals. Also in the ""Appendix"" Faulkner stresses the economically tenuous origins of the family prior to their migration to Mississippi, but in the novel itself the emphasis is on their upper class status in the past. Jason thinks, for example, about how ""my people owned slaves here"" (239), and Quentin has a vision of Grandfather ""on a high place"" (176).</p>","Yes"
"24134","3780","Earliest Yoknapatawpha Families","Earliest Yoknapatawpha Families","","<p><em>The Town</em> contains two different kinds of lists of the old (white) Yoknapatawpha families.  The first such list is constructed by Gavin Stevens as he reflects on the county's history, and unlike the second list in this novel or the kind of role Faulkner provides elsewhere, Gavin's thoughts include the early lower class settlers as well as ""the proud fading white plantation names"" like  ""Sutpen and Sartoris and Compson and Edmonds and McCaslin and Beauchamp and Grenier and Habersham"" (332).  These aristocratic families own the ""rich plantation earth,"" while the lower class families settled in the ""hill-country"" (332). This group consists of the ""McCallum and Gowrie and Frazier and Muir"" families (332). He characterizes the first group mainly in terms of their social roles: ""generals and governors and judges, soldiers . . . and statesmen""; the second, in terms of their Gaelic background (332). These families often occupy central roles in other Yoknapatawpha novels, though Muirs are not mentioned elsewhere. The white Beauchamps who own a plantation live outside Yoknapatawpha; the only Yoknapatawpha Beauchamps are descended from the white planter Carothers Edmonds and Tomey, his enslaved daughter.  (See also the entry for ""Major Yoknapatawpha Families,"" in this novel and elsewhere.)</p>","Yes"
"24051","3778","Unnamed Patrol-riders","Unnamed Patrol-riders","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em>, when Buck and Buddy McCaslin allow their slaves to live in the plantation big house and leave the place at night by the back door, the white inhabitants of the area share stories or rumors of ""McCaslin slaves dodging the moonlit roads and the Patrol-riders to visit other plantations"" (249).  ""Patrol-riders"" - more frequently referred to as 'patrollers,' 'paterollers' or 'paterrollers' (see <em>The Unvanquished</em>, for an example from Faulkner) - were armed white men whose job was to apprehend slaves found off their plantation after dark and to pursue fugitive slaves.</p>","Yes"
"23899","3777","Unnamed Acquaintances of Lonnie Grinnup","Unnamed Acquaintances of Lonnie Grinnup","","<p>These are the people who live ""in houses [and] cabins ten and fifteen miles away"" from Lonnie Grinnup's shack (71).  According to ""Hand Upon the Waters,"" Lonnie Grinnup and Joe periodically visit them, sometimes ""for weeks"" - the story simply refers to them as ""his hosts"" (71).  They mostly seem to be farmers, since Lonnie and Joe sometimes sleep in ""the hay of lofts,"" but some of them at least are prosperous enough to have ""company rooms"" with ""beds"" to sleep in (71).</p>","Yes"
"23863","3776","Unnamed Tidewater Planter","Unnamed Tidewater Planter","","<p>In <em>Absalom!</em>, after moving to Virginia Sutpen's father works for this planter, whom the ""thirteen or fourteen""-year-old Thomas (185) thinks of as ""the man who owned all the land and the niggers and apparently the white men who superintended the work"" on the plantation (184).  Thomas spies on him as he spends his afternoons lying in a hammock being waiting on by a slave.  Later Thomas will re-enact this scene in the arbor in Yoknapatawpha with Wash Jones as his servant.</p>","No"
"23860","3775","George Washington","Washington, George","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin associates ""Washington not telling lies"" with ""Jesus walking on Galilee"" (80).  Jesus walks on water in the New Testament.  The mythic claim that even as a boy George Washington, the first President of the U.S., 'could not tell a lie' was created by an early biographer and educator named Parson Weems, who thought that the story of young Washington and the cherry tree he chopped down would be edifying for the young men of the early American republic.  Weems himself <em>could</em> tell a lie.</p>","No"
"23858","3774","Saint Francis","Francis, Saint","","<p>""Saint Francis"" - known as Francis of Assisi, the Catholic friar who founded the Franciscan Order in the early 13th century - wrote the words that Quentin Compson remembers on the first page of his section in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> in the song ""The Canticle of the Sun"": ""All praise be yours, my Lord, through Sister Death, From whose embrace no mortal can escape.""</p>","No"
"23855","3773","Unnamed College Widow","Unnamed College Widow","","<p>Herbert Head mentions ""a little widow over in town"" when he is trying to ingratiate himself with Caddy's brother Quentin (110).  The ""town"" is presumably Boston, ""over"" the river from Harvard.  Although it has been suggested that Head is talking about a prostitute, the idea of 'the college widow' as an unmarried woman who dates a succession of students over the years was proverbial in both 1910 (when the conversation takes place) and 1929 (when <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> was published).</p>","No"
"23853","3771","Unnamed Outlanders","Unnamed Outlanders","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> both Chick Mallison and Gavin Stevens at different points imagine a group they identify as ""outlanders"" (149, 199).  In the second instance Gavin describes them to Chick as the people of ""the North and East and West"" who are currently seeking to ""force on us [the South] laws based on the idea that man's injustice to man can be abolished overnight"" (199).  Chick's sense of this group as ""the North"" is more visceral: ""countless row on row of faces which resemble his face and spoke the same language he spoke"" but who have an ""almost helpless capacity and eagerness to believe anything about the South"" as long as it is ""bizarre enough"" (149-50).  Much of the novel's second half seems to be written directly for - or perhaps more accurately <em>at</em> - these ""people in the North"" (151) who need to let the white South ""expiate and abolish"" the injustices of racism themselves, ""alone and without help or even (with thanks) advice"" (199).</p>","No"
"23852","3770","Unnamed Uncle of Sam Caldwell","Unnamed Uncle of Sam Caldwell","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> Sam Caldwell's uncle is a ""division superintendent"" on the railroad line Same works for (130).

"23848","3766","Unnamed Idlers in Livery Stable","Unnamed Idlers in Livery Stable","","<p>This is the group of men that Lucius refers to in <em>The Reivers</em>, ironically, as ""our Jefferson leisure class"": the ""friends or acquaintances of Father's or maybe just friends of horses"" who congregate in the livery stable to pass the time (38).  They expect neither ""any business"" nor ""any mail"" to come their way (38).  In other Yoknapatawpha novels such men typically sit in the barbershop or the park around the courthouse.</p>","Yes"
"23847","3765","Unnamed Tipster","Unnamed Tipster","","<p>This is the ""man on the streetcar"" in <em>The Reivers</em> who gives Mr. Binford the (bad) tip about ""which horse and buggy"" to bet on at the race track (108).</p>","No"

This entry assumes that ""everybody else"" is black, and belongs to one of the families of tenant farmers who work an allotted piece of the Edmonds property.  We assume that because Lucius adds that the group does not include ""the ones Cousin Zack could actually see from his horse"" (61).  Here ""the ones"" clearly refers to the people whom the white land owner Zack expects to see working in the fields instead of taking time off to stare at a car.</p>","Yes"

Between Ballenbaugh's and Hell Creek bottom the countryside seems rural: along the road are ""sprouting fields"" (78).

But a major difference is that this crowd is racially unsegregated: ""people, black and white"" (228).  One member of this crowd leads Lightning to the starting line after Ned is disqualified.

But until the 1870s the people at Ballenbaugh's were ""just tough men,"" i.e. no women (72).  When the railroad took over the freight traffic in the 1880s, however, Ballenbaugh's becomes a destination point.  The narrative enumerates the men and women who live at or patronize Ballenbaugh's between the 1870s and 1886 as ""drunks and fiddlers and gamblers and girls"" (74), and also as ""brigands and murderers"" (77).

"23799","3717","Unnamed Negro Old Man","Unnamed Negro Old Man","","<p>When he describes his situation on the verge of launching the forbidden trip to Memphis in <em>The Reivers</em>, Lucius says ""I was in the position of the old Negro who said, 'Here I is, Lord. . . ."" (62).  He (or Faulkner) may have a specific person in mind, but this tempted black man seems more like the product of Lucius' imagination, and a suggestive one at that.</p>","No"
"23798","3716","Unnamed Negro ""Boys""","Unnamed Negro ""Boys""","","<p>This entry represents the group that Lucius refers to in <em>The Reivers</em> when he wonders how heroic his role in the story really is.  If the Negro Bobo has the automobile, he thinks, then all the adventurers would have to do to get it back is ""send one of the family colored boys to fetch it"" (224).  These ""boys"" don't ever appear in the narrative, and it's not clear what ""family"" they are connected with - McCaslin? Priest? Edmonds?  Because Faulkner's southern whites regularly use ""boy"" to refer to adult black males, it's not clear how old these ""boys"" are, or whether they are tenant farmers or domestic servants, or the children of people in one of these groups.  But Lucius' anxiety about whether his place in the narrative could have been filled instead by any one of these ""colored boys"" seems significant enough to merit recognition.</p>","Yes"
"23797","3715","Unnamed Voyeurs","Unnamed Voyeurs","","<p>This is the group that Lucius contemptuously refers in <em>The Reivers</em> as the ""brutal and shameless men"" (155) who pay Otis a dime to watch his aunt, Miss Corrie, ""pugnuckling,"" having sex, with paying customers (154).</p>","No"
"23796","3714","Unnamed Young Man Sartoris Killed","Unnamed Young Man Sartoris Killed","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> the ""twenty-year-old Yoknapatawpha County youth"" who was killed by Colonel John Sartoris cannot be specifically identified (73).  In other Yoknapatawpha fictions Sartoris kills a number of different men.  If Faulkner is thinking of one of them here, it is most likely the man Sartoris shot as a robber in both <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (1929) and ""An Odor of Verbena,"" the last story in <em>The Unvanquished</em> (1938).  In ""Verbena"" this man is identified as ""almost a neighbor, a hillman,"" whom Sartoris shot ""quickly,"" before it was absolutely clear that he intended to rob Sartoris of the money he was carrying to help pay for building the railroad.  In <em>The Reivers</em>, that ""railroad"" is mentioned in the same sentence as the ""murdered"" man (73).</p>","Yes"

Both he and the event may be apocryphal, though to the Priest family, Lucius says, it is all ""historical fact"" (94).  (See Unnamed Union Officers elsewhere in this index.)</p>","No"
"23793","3711","Unnamed Wives of Ned McCaslin","Unnamed Wives of Ned McCaslin","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> Lucius notes in passing that Delphine is the wife Ned has in 1904, and that during his lifetime he ""ran through four wives"" (31).

"23792","3710","Unnamed Wife of Parsham Doctor","Unnamed Wife of Parsham Doctor","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> the ""fat iron-gray woman in pince-nez"" who opens the door at the Parsham doctor's house might be his sister, but since he mentions his marriage a few pages later it seems more likely that she is his wife (185).</p>","No"
"23791","3709","Wylie 2","Wylie 2","","<p>This ""Mr Wylie"" in <em>The Reivers</em> is a ""family friend"" of the Priests in 1905 (69).

"23790","3708","Wylie 1","Wylie 1","","<p>The man whom Lucius refers to in <em>The Reivers</em> as the ""first Wylie"" seems to have played a major role in shaping Yoknapatawpha County (71).  When he set up his store at a crossing over the Tallahatchie River, the Indians still lived in the area.  Because his place was ""the head of navigation"" - the furthest ""small steamboats"" could travel upriver from the Mississippi - the ""whiskey and plows and coal oil and peppermint candy"" that Yoknapatawpha imported from Vicksburg and the ""cotton and furs"" that it shipped out to the world were loaded or unloaded at his place (72).  And it was the ferry that he ran at the site of the crossing that soon carried even more freight to and from Memphis by ""mule- or ox-drawn"" wagon (72).  According to this novel, the road that runs north from Jefferson to Memphis in the Yoknapatawpha fictions was built where it is to reach Wyott's ferryboat.  When the first Ballenbaugh arrived sometime before the Civil War to take over the store and ferry, this Wyott ""moved four miles back from the river and became a farmer"" (72).  (In earlier editions of the novel, his name was ""Wyott."")</p>","Yes"

"23788","3706","Mack Winbush","Winbush, Mack","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> ""Mack Winbush's"" is where one can buy the moonshine whiskey that Cal Bookwright makes (12), but the text does not say if Winbush's is a farm or juke joint or something else.</p>","Yes"

He is originally from Chicago, but on a trip to Memphis decided he liked it so much that he moved to Tennessee and became a breeder of race horses.  It is because he is ""a foreigner"" (281) - i.e. from the North - that he does not behave correctly when his black employee, Bobo, asks for money to help him out of trouble.  But the narrative treats him favorably as a friend of both Colonel Linscomb and Grandfather.</p>","No"
"23782","3700","Son Thomas","Son Thomas","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> Son Thomas is ""the youngest driver"" who works at Maury Priest's livery stable (4).  The ""Son"" in his name is not connected to any specific parents.</p>","Yes"

Either he or the oil company is also far-sighted enough recently to have added ""a special tank of gasoline"" to the tanks holding oil (48).  His name suggests a connection to ""Mrs. Rouncewell's boarding house"" (26), where Boon lives, and there are men named Rouncewell in both <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em> he could be, or be related to, but the novel does not make any of those connections explicit.</p>","Yes"
"23780","3698","Miss Rhodes","Rhodes, Miss","","<p>At the end of <em>The Reivers</em> Lucius notes that ""Miss Rhodes was going to let me make up the [school] work"" he missed while having his adventure in Tennessee (296).  She is obviously his teacher - and a very understanding one too.</p>","Yes"
"23778","3696","Paul Rainey","Rainey, Paul","","<p>The ""Paul Rainey"" whom Lucius mentions in <em>The Reivers</em> was a real Northern millionaire famous for his love of hunting (163).  As Lucius notes, he ""liked our country enough to use some of [his] Wall Street money"" to purchase 11,000 acres of Mississippi land as a hunting preserve (163).  Faulkner's father Murry knew him personally.</p>","Yes"
"23777","3695","John Powell","Powell, John","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> John Powell is ""the head hostler"" at the Priest livery stable (4).  A hostler is someone who looks after horses.  On his twenty-first birthday, as ""ineffaceable proof that he was . . . a man"" (6), he bought a pistol that he carries to work in his overalls.  Having the gun in the stable is against the rules, but he and Maury Priest handle this ""moral problem"" (6) by ignoring the its existence, ""as mutual gentlemen must and should"" (8).  The novel does not discuss how Powell's race - he is black - might figure in the way he defines 'manhood' or defies the rules.  And while the rules in this case seem to be local to the livery stable, the Jim Crow South was anxious about the Second Amendment when it came to blacks arming themselves.  One of the first gun registration laws in the U.S. was passed in Mississippi in 1906 - the year after the novel's events take place - according to commentators as a means of keeping track of who owned pistols.  As part of the history of Powell's gun the narrative mentions ""his wife"" and ""his father"" (6).</p>","Yes"
"23776","3694","Mrs. John Powell","Powell, Mrs. John","","<p>John Powell's wife is not named in <em>The Reivers</em>, but she is mentioned as having ""stitched a neat strong pocket"" inside his overalls for the pistol he chooses to carry (7).</p>","Yes"

Ned admires the way he takes care of his wife, who has had a stroke, washing and feeding her.  He also sorts out the various characters and their doings with a clear sense of humanity and justice.</p>","No"
"23772","3690","George Peyton","Peyton, George","","<p>Among the well-known sportsmen who come to Parsham every winter for the ""National Trials"" of pedigree bird dogs, Lucius mentions four names.  Two are identifiable as real men (Horace Lytle and Paul Rainey).  Lucius, the narrator of <em>The Reivers</em>, compares ""George Peyton"" to Lytle: the two are ""as magical among bird dog people"" as Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb are to baseball fans (189).  This pairing suggests that like Lytle, Peyton is a real person; in fact, a dog handler named George Payton was active at least during the 1920s, once handling Pearl Momoney at the National Bird Dog Championship.</p>","No"
"23771","3689","Otis","Otis","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> Otis is Corrie's nephew, visiting Memphis from his home in Arkansas in order to acquire ""refinement"" (97).  Although he has his fifteenth birthday in the course of the story, he is smaller than the 11-year-old Lucius.  As Lucius says the first time he sees Otis, ""there is something wrong about him"" (104).  By the time Lucius calls him a ""demon child"" (154), most readers are likely to agree.</p>","No"

"23768","3686","Horace Lytle","Lytle, Horace","","<p>The ""Horace Lytle"" whom Lucius mentions in <em>The Reivers</em> in connection with Parsham's annual hunting dog show is almost certainly the real Horace Lytle who in 1927 became the gun dog editor of the magazine <em>Field & Stream</em>.

"23766","3684","Butch Lovemaiden","Lovemaiden, Butch","","<p>Butch, the deputy sheriff who bullies Boon and Corrie in Parsham in <em>The Reivers</em>, says his last name is ""Lovemaiden"" (187).  This could be true, though it's not impossible that he gives himself that name as another way to annoy Boon.  He is described as being ""almost as big as Boon and almost as ugly, with a red face and a badge"" (168) and ""a bachelor"" (190).  Lucius says he smells of ""sweat and whiskey"" (170).</p>","No"

He does not appear in person until late in the story, but is invariably referred to as ""Colonel Linscomb"" by the other characters Lucius meets in Parsham.  His plantation (which contains the track on which the horses race) and mansion (where the story unwinds after the races are over) are both extremely lavish and well-maintained.  He is obviously an old friend of Grandfather Priest.</p>","No"
"23763","3681","Grandmother Lessep","Lessep, Grandmother","","<p>The mother of Lucius' mother.  The only information about her that Lucius provides in <em>The Reivers</em> is that ""Grandmother and Grandmother Lessep lived far enough apart to continue to be civil and even pleasant"" to each other (45).  ""Grandmother"" is his father's mother.  The Lesseps live 300 miles from Jefferson.</p>","Yes"
"23762","3680","Grandfather Lessep","Lessep, Grandfather","","<p>The father of Lucius Priest's mother, his death at the beginning of <em>The Reivers</em> provides the opportunity for Boon and Lucius' adventure.

"23758","3676","Uncle Parsham Hood","Hood, Uncle Parsham","","<p>If there is something demeaning about the way so many characters in <em>The Reivers</em> refer to him as ""Uncle Possum,"" Parsham Hood is nonetheless one of Faulkner's more impressive black characters.  His clothes and facial hair make him look like a white planter or a southern ""colonel"": upon first meeting him Lucius describes him as ""an old man very dark in a white shirt and galluses and a planter's hat, with perfectly white moustaches and an imperial [beard]"" (164).  At another point Lucius says his appearance is ""even regal"" (218).  He is both very dignified and also very nurturing toward Lucius, even allowing him to share his bed.  His ""gold toothpick"" and table manners remind Lucius of his Grandfather (241), but the character whom readers are most likely to associate him with is Lucas Beauchamp in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> and <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>; he even has ""a smolder of fire on the hearth"" in his room, although it's May (244).</p>","No"
"23757","3675","Mrs. Parsham Hood","Hood, Mrs. Parsham","","<p>Like Lucas' Beauchamp's cabin in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, Parsham Hood's cabin in <em>The Reivers</em> contains ""a big gold-framed portrait on a gold easel"" (244).

"23755","3673","Hiram Hightower","Hightower, Hiram","","<p>The man in <em>The Reivers</em> who in 1886 ""converts the entire settlement"" at Ballenbaugh's ""with his fists"" is named Hiram Hightower (74).  His description allows us to say for sure that he is ""a giant of a man,"" and served during the Civil War as both a ""trooper"" and a ""chaplain"" in Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry unit (74).  On the other hand, the narrative says nothing about a possible relationship between this Hiram Hightower and the two Gail Hightower's in <em>Light in August</em>, the senior a Confederate cavalryman and chaplain who is killed in 1863, and the junior his grandson, a Presbyterian minister and one of Faulkner's more memorable characters, but since these Hightowers are from a different part of Mississippi, it's unlikely that Faulkner imagined any relationship between them and Hiram.</p>","Yes"
"23754","3672","Fitz-Hugh Porter","Porter, Fitz-Hugh","","<p>Porter was a career Army officer who led a Union division at Gaine's Mill, Virginia, during the Civil War.

"23751","3669","Gabe","Gabe","","<p>Gabe is identified in <em>The Reivers</em> as ""the blacksmith"" at Priest's livery stable (6).  ""Though short, he was a tremendously big man,"" one of whose knees is ""terrifically twisted from an old injury in his trade"" (9).</p>","Yes"
"23750","3668","Forrest, Brother of Nathan Bedford","Forrest, Brother of Nathan Bedford","","<p>Nathan Bedford Forrest had two brothers who also served as Confederate officers during the Civil War: Colonel Jeffrey Edward Forrest and Lieutenant Colonel Jesse Anderson Forrest.  Either could have been the officer in charge of the event Lucius recalls in <em>The Reivers</em> - ""legend to some people maybe.  To us historical fact"" - about the Confederate cavalrymen who galloped into Memphis' Gayoso Hotel ""and almost captured a Yankee general,"" but it's more likely Faulkner was thinking of Jeffrey, the younger brother, who was born in Mississippi and who died in action in Mississippi in 1864 (94).</p>","No"
"23749","3667","Henry Ford","Ford, Henry","","<p>Henry Ford's name was almost synonymous with automobile during the early decades of the 20th century.  The Model T Ford, which he introduced in 1908, brought owning a car within the reach of average Americans - though the car that Grandfather Priest owns in <em>The Reivers</em> is a much more aristocratic make and model.</p>","No"
"23748","3666","Unnamed Grenier Descendant","Unnamed Grenier Descendant","","<p>This character is mentioned in <em>The Reivers</em> as an ""idiot nephew or cousin or something"" of Dan Grinnup, and like him is a last living descendant of the Grenier family, perhaps the oldest white family in Yoknapatawpha (7).  He lives ""in a tent in the river jungle beyond Frenchman's Bend,"" on land that had once been part of the big antebellum ""plantation"" belonging to Louis Grenier (the ""Frenchman"" from whom the Bend gets its name, 7).

A ""dirty old man with a tobacco-stained beard,"" he is ""never quite completely drunk,"" but obviously is an alcoholic (7).  His daughter married Ballott, the stable's foreman, but apparently he owes his marginal position at work to the fact that, when the family was in better circumstances, Maury Priest ""used to fox hunt with old Dan's father out at Frenchman's Bend"" (8).  In the stable he has ""no official position,"" but does work as a carriage driver, which inspires the remark (one that Faulkner had already used in connection with another fallen aristocrat in <em>Sanctuary</em>) ""that once Greniers led Yoknapatawpha society; now Grinnups drove it"" (8).</p>","Yes"
"23746","3664","Father of Dan Grinnup","Father of Dan Grinnup","","<p>""When Father was a boy,"" Lucius Priest says in <em>The Reivers</em>, ""he used to fox hunt with old Dan's father out at Frenchman's Bend"" (8).  Dan is Dan Grinnup, but his father's last name could have been Grenier.  He was descended from Louis Grenier, the man from whom Frenchman's Bend gets its name.  Because Dan and a ""cousin or something"" are the last living descendants of Grenier at the time of the story (8), we know his father is dead.  But there's no way to know how far the family had fallen from the Louis' aristocratic rank, or how far along the path of linguistic corruption the name had gotten on its slide from Grenier to Grinnup.  Fox hunting with member of the Priest family implies a high social status - if this man was there as a fellow rider.</p>","Yes"
"23745","3663","Ephum","Ephum","","<p>Mentioned first in <em>The Reivers</em> as ""a Negro man"" who works for Miss Ballenbaugh (75), Ephum presumably helps her farm, takes care of the horses of the men who stay there, and does other masculine chores around the place.  Ned stays overnight at his home, which must be nearby.</p>","Yes"
"23744","3662","Edmonds, Wives of Edmondses","Edmonds, Wives of Edmondses","","<p>In his description of the McCaslin-Edmonds' plantation house in <em>The Reivers</em>, Lucius mentions how ""the women the successive Edmondses marry"" have enlarged and transformed the original building (61).  At least some of these wives appear in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, and Louisa Edmonds, who appears in this novel, is presumably one of them as well.</p>","Yes"
"23743","3661","Ty Cobb","Cobb, Ty","","<p>During Ty Cobb's career as an outfielder with the Detroit Tigers (1905-1921) he set 90 baseball records.  In <em>The Reivers</em> Lucius  expects the grandson to whom he is telling the story in 1961 to recognize his name along with Babe Ruth's.</p>","No"
"23742","3660","Walter Clapp","Clapp, Walter","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> Acheron's trainer - the ""white man"" whom Lycurgus refers to ""Mr Walter"" (221) - must be the same man whom a member of the crowd at the race calls ""Walter Clapp"" (235).</p>","No"

He owes his job to his uncle, a ""division superintendent"" on the rail line (127), but shows himself as generous and kind when he helps the adventurers smuggle their horse to Parsham and again throughout their misadventures once they get there.  Lucius says he is ""almost as big as Boon"" (135), and Boon sees him as a rival for Corrie's affections.</p>","No"
"23740","3658","Mary Hood Briggins","Briggins, Mary Hood","","<p>""Uncle"" Parsham Hood's daughter and Lycurgus' mother is explicitly named ""Briggins"" - though her husband is not mentioned in <em>The Reivers</em>.</p>","No"
"23739","3657","Lycurgus Briggins","Briggins, Lycurgus","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> Lycurgus is ""a pleasant-looking Negro youth of about nineteen"" (162), and the grandson of Uncle Parsham Hood.  Hood's daughter Mary is his mother; the narrative never mentions the man named Briggins who is his father.  A very polite young man, he even refers to Ned as ""Mr. McCaslin,"" confusing Lucius, who obviously assumes he must be speaking about a white man (222).</p>","No"
"23738","3656","Mrs. Ballott","Ballott, Mrs.","","<p>""Mr Ballott's first wife"" was the daughter of Dan Grinnup (8).  Ballott's other wife or wives are not mentioned, and <em>The Reivers</em> does not explain why he is no longer married to this woman, but divorce is so rare in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha that it seems likely she has died.</p>","Yes"
"23737","3655","Mr. Ballott","Ballott, Mr.","","<p>Mr. Ballott is ""the white stable foreman"" at the Priest livery stable in <em>The Reivers</em> (7).  He runs the business and keeps track of the black employees during the day.  The novel's reference to his ""first wife"" makes it clear that he has been married at least twice (8).</p>","Yes"
"23736","3654","Miss Ballenbaugh","Ballenbaugh, Miss","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> Ballenbaugh's is currently owned by the ""only child"" of the second Ballenbaugh, a ""fifty-year-old maiden"" (74).  She is described as a ""prim fleshless severe iron-gray woman"" who makes her living farming the land, and ""running a small store"" that has a loft which accommodates overnight guests (74).  She may be ""fleshless,"" but the food on ""the table Miss Ballenbaugh sets"" is well known for the pleasure it provides (74).</p>","Yes"
"23735","3653","Ballenbaugh 2","Ballenbaugh 2","","<p>Ballenbaugh's son, also known in <em>The Reivers</em> simply as ""Ballenbaugh,"" is, like his father, a ""giant"" (73).  He claims to have served the Confederacy during the Civil War as a ""partisan ranger"" in Arkansas, but the narrative casts that story in doubt, suggesting instead that he acquired the pile of ""uncut United States bank notes"" he returns with in 1865 by more illegal means (73).  Under his ownership Ballenbaugh's becomes even more lawless: stolen animals are fenced there, illegal whiskey is made there, and under the ""euphemistic blanket-term of dance hall,"" it is also a house of prostitution - until it is cleaned up in 1886 by a Baptist minister (74).</p>","Yes"
"23734","3652","Ballenbaugh 1","Ballenbaugh 1","","<p>The first Ballenbaugh in Yoknapatawpha is as colorful as the place that bears his name.  Described in <em>The Reivers</em> as an ""ancestryless giant,"" he arrived in the county ""from nowhere"" and by some means - the narrative implies a coercive one - took over the store and ferry run by a man named Wylie (72).  Under his ownership, the place became a ""roaring"" one: a ""grubbing station and saloon"" for the wagon-drivers who passed through on the way to or from Memphis (72).</p>","Yes"
"23733","3651","Jim Avant","Avant, Jim","","<p>""Mr Jim Avant from Hickory Flat,” one of the four well-known dog breeders and trainers mentioned in <em>The Reivers</em>, is almost certainly intended to be  J.M. (James Monroe) Avent was a well-known owner and trainer of pedigreed bird dogs. He co-established the National Bird Dog Championship and in 1930.  <em>Time</em> magazine called him the ""most celebrated of contemporary handlers,"" citing too his nickname the ""Fox of Hickory Valley,"" his home in Tennessee. Faulkner either misremembered or misspelled his name in this novel, and he also relocated hi m - perhaps on purpose.</p>","No"
"23732","3650","Aunt Fittie","Fittie, Aunt","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> Otis tells Lucius that Aunt Fittie, who took Corrie in after her mother's death, ""might have been kin to some of us,"" but that isn't definite (153).  She lives ""in a house on the edge"" a small town in Arkansas and prostitutes the ""eleven or twelve"" year-old Corrie to local men for fifty cents a visit (154).</p>","No"
"23731","3649","Aunt Callie","Callie, Aunt","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> ""Aunt"" Callie's title is the culture's label for a black woman of her age and in her role as a 'mammy' to Lucius and his brothers.  She was ""born in the country and still preferred it"" (49), although she lives in town with the family she works for.  While black and a servant, she does not hesitate to berate white males in the line of her duty to her charges - although her frequent ""yelling"" has no effect on any of them (54).</p>","Yes"
"23730","3648","Unnamed White Male Citizens of Yoknapatawpha","Unnamed White Male Citizens of Yoknapatawpha","","<p><em>Requiem for a Nun</em> identifies the voters in Yoknapatawpha during the hundred years after the building of the courthouse in 1835 as ""the white male citizens of the county"" (37).  Historically of course, a pair of Constitutional amendments gave black males the right to vote in 1870 and women the vote in 1920, but perhaps the novel is reminding us about the peculiar (unwritten) constitution of the world Faulkner is representing.</p>","Yes"
"23729","3647","Unnamed Travellers through the Wilderness","Unnamed Travellers through the Wilderness","","<p>According to <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> the pioneers and other men who travel through the wilderness do so ""armed and in parties,"" for protection against the robbers and murderers who lurk there (9).</p>","No"
"23728","3646","Unnamed People of Modern America","Unnamed People of Modern America","","<p>In a facetious passage connecting the lost lock in 1826 to the future of the U.S., the narrator of <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> makes ""a glorious prophecy"" about the when when the American ""people"" will identify federal money with the ""manna"" of a generous god (17).  They are described as ""a race of laborers"" whose only labor it to consume government funds (17).</p>","No"
"23727","3645","Unnamed Negro Voters 2","Unnamed Negro Voters 2","","<p>According to <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, ""even Negroes"" can vote in Yoknapatawpha elections ""now"" - though these enfranchised voters ""vote for the same .  . . white supremacy champions that the white"" voters elected (38).</p>","Yes"
"23725","3643","Unnamed Girl in a Book","Unnamed Girl in a Book","","<p>In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> Temple compares her own experience overcoming trauma to this fictional character.  Although Faulkner blurs the details, saying that the book in which this woman appears was written by ""somebody - Hemingway, wasn't it?"" (121), it's very likely that Temple is thinking of Maria, a character in Hemingway's <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>.  According to Temple's account, this character freed herself from the past by ""refusing to accept it"" (121).</p>","No"
"23724","3642","Unnamed Enslaved Headman at Sutpen's","Unnamed Enslaved Headman at Sutpen's","","<p>In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> Sutpen's ""Negro headman and hunter"" assists him in tracking down and capturing the runaway architect (32).</p>","Yes"
"23723","3641","Unnamed Friends of Temple and Gowan","Unnamed Friends of Temple and Gowan","","<p>Describing her married life in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, Temple refers to the ""country club younger set"" of friends with whom she and Gowan socialize (124).  Apparently assuming it is a progressive gesture, these friends ""applaud"" when Temple hires the black ""ex-dope-fiend"" Nancy as a nurse for her children (124).</p>","Yes"
"23722","3640","Unnamed Descendants of the German Carpetbagger","Unnamed Descendants of the German Carpetbagger","","<p>According to <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>'s account of the modern South, the daughters of the German blacksmith who deserted from the Union Army to become one of the carpetbaggers who preyed on Jefferson in time ""become matriarchs and grandmothers of the town's new aristocracy"" (183).</p>","Yes"
"23721","3639","Ratlif, Descendants of Ratcliffe","Ratlif, Descendants of Ratcliffe","","<p><em>Requiem for a Nun</em> refers to three generations of descendants from the ""Ratcliffe"" who first arrived in the settlement that became Jefferson, and notes how over that time the name ""lost the 'c' and the final 'fe' too"" (13).  Although he is not singled out in this text, the latest descendant is V.K. Ratliff, one of Faulkner's favorite characters - although in the <em>Requiem</em> passage Faulkner seems to have forgotten that his name still has both ""f""s.</p>","Yes"
"23720","3638","Unnamed Mother of Mrs. Harriss","Unnamed Mother of Mrs. Harriss","","<p>Mrs. Harriss's mother is referred to as her husband’s ""own life’s one monogamous love"" (150).  (Based on other Yoknapatawpha fictions, this woman is Mrs. Backus, but that name is not used in ""Knight's Gambit."")</p>","Yes"
"23719","3637","Unnamed Taxi Drivers in Memphis","Unnamed Taxi Drivers in Memphis","","<p>In ""Knight's Gambit"" Gavin Stevens learns that Max Harriss is ""well known"" to the ""taxi-drivers"" in the area of Memphis around the Greenbury Hotel (208).</p>","No"

"23717","3635","Unnamed Magazine Editors","Unnamed Magazine Editors","","<p>In comparing Mr. Harriss to Huey Long in ""Knight's Gambit,"" Charles Mallison describes how the politician ""made himself founder owner and supporter of what his uncle said was one of the best literary magazines anywhere,"" probably not ""even caring what the people who wrote and edited it"" produced (241).  Faulkner is referring to a real magazine, the <em>Louisiana Progress</em>.</p>","No"
"23716","3634","Unnamed Local Friends of Gualdres","Unnamed Local Friends of Gualdres","","<p>Although Sebastian Gualdres’s Mississippi friends in ""Knight's Gambit"" include ""all sorts of people,"" the Whitmanian type tends to dominate the description of them: ""out-of-doors men, usually bachelors"" (174).  The range of occupations they are identified with is wide: from ""farmers"" to ""mechanics""; ""a civil engineer,"" ""a professional horse-and-mule trader,"" ""two young men on the highway maintenance crew"" and ""a locomotive fireman"" (174).</p>","Yes"
"23715","3633","Unnamed Members of Mob","Unnamed Members of Mob","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> the white people who crowd Jefferson's main streets in anticipation of the arrival of a lynch mob from Beat Four are from everywhere in Yoknapatawpha except Beat Four.  It begins to form on Sunday morning, with a small group made up of young men from town.  As it grows larger through that day and into Monday afternoon, it seems to be dominated by country people: ""the men and the women and not one child, the weathered country faces and sunburned necks and backs of hands, the clean faded tieless earthcolored shirts and pants and print cotton dresses thronging the Square"" (133).  ""Not one child"" does not mean no boys, because the crowd includes ""boys who should have been in school at this hour"" (179).  And there are still many townspeople in it, from just about every class: ""merchants and cotton-buyers and automobile dealers and the younger men who were the clerks in the stores and cotton offices and salesrooms and mechanics in the garages and filling stations"" (177).  Along with young children, apparently there are no professional men in this mob: ""the doctors and lawyers and ministers"" are explicitly excluded (177).  Technically, this is not a lynch mob - according to narrator, they don't intend to kill Lucas themselves but are there ""to see that Beat Four should not fail its white man's high estate"" (134).  To Chick, it becomes a surreal ""Face"" that looms over his longing to believe in his neighbors (178).  When this crowd somehow learns that Lucas is not the killer, it disperses quickly, leaving Chick and Gavin to argue about what its presence - ""perspicuant jocular and without pity"" (142) - says about ""the whole white foundation of the county"" (135).</p>","Yes"
"23714","3632","Tubbs Children","Tubbs Children","","<p>The Tubbs' children in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> are mentioned when he tells Gavin, ""I got a wife and two children"" (52).</p>","Yes"
"23713","3631","Owl-at-Night","Owl-at-Night","","<p>Though called ""Owl-by-Night"" the first time he is mentioned (363), this Chickasaw is more often referred to in ""A Courtship"" as ""Owl-at-Night"" (364).

After that, he willingly helps Ikkemotubbe with his efforts to win the young woman.</p>","Yes"
"23712","3630","Unnamed Neighbors of Wesley Pritchel","Unnamed Neighbors of Wesley Pritchel","","<p>""An Error in Chemistry"" refers to the neighbors of Wesley Pritchel as the ""people in the adjacent countryside"" (119).  It is safe to assume that they are all, like Pritchel himself, farming families.  They play several different roles in the story.  They gossip about Wesley's relationship with his ""son-in-law"" (114).  Until Pritchel drives them off, they take clay from his clay-pit to make ""serviceable though crude pottery"" (119).  The ""man and his wife"" who are Pritchel's ""nearest neighbors"" are summoned to his house by the sheriff to stay with the old man after Ellie's murder (118).  This couple is soon joined by ""other neighbors,"" all of whom stay at Pritchel's house even though he yells at them to leave (118).  They return to the house for Ellie's funeral, when a ""meagre group"" of them attend the burial (125) and ""two neighbor women"" cook a hot meal for him (124).</p>","Yes"
"23711","3629","Cousin Melisandre","Melisandre, Cousin","","<p>The young woman whom Bayard calls ""Cousin Melisandre"" in the short story with the long title ""My Grandmother Millard and General Bedford Forrest and the Battle of Harrykin Creek"" is a upper class refugee: she leaves Memphis after it is captured by the Union forces to spend the War at the Sartoris plantation in northern Mississippi.  She seems related to Bayard on his mother's (Millard) side, but the only information the story provides about her family is General Forrest's reference to ""that uncle or whoever it is that calls himself her guardian"" (694).  After her marriage at the end of the story she is Melisandre Backus, whose significance in the larger Yoknapatawpha canon is as the ancestor of the woman whom Gavin Stevens marries - also named Melisandre Backus.  In this story, however, her role is mainly to provide Faulkner with a way to satirize the affectations of the stereotypical heroine of other writers' Civil War romances.</p>","Yes"
"23710","3628","Unnamed Landlady in Jefferson","Unnamed Landlady in Jefferson","","<p>After Ike McCaslin moves into town in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, this landlady rents him the room where he continues to live at least at the beginning of his marriage.</p>","Yes"

"23697","3616","Unnamed Veterans of World War II","Unnamed Veterans of World War II","","<p>Veterans who have returned from fighting in the Second World War are a major element of the social landscape in the second half of <em>The Mansion</em>.  Goodyhay's unconventional congregation is made up mainly of vets, or their surviving parents and spouses; one of them wears a ""barracks cap still showing where the officer's badge had been"" to the church service (305).  Because they know what ""Devries's medal meant,"" veterans form an important element in the anti-Snopes coalition during the 1946 Congressional election (346).  The novel refers to the housing development that Flem creates and calls ""Eula Acres"" as ""a subdivision of standardized Veterans' Housing matchboxes"" because so many of the new residents are ex-G.I.'s and ex-Marines (366).  As Gavin Stevens puts it, almost immediately after World War II ended ""the troops"" began coming home ""from all directions,"" and soon ""the hero who a year ago was rushing hand grenades and Garand clips up to front-line foxholes, is now rushing baskets of soiled didies [diapers] out of side- and back-street Veterans Administration tenements"" (365).

As part of the novel's description of Jake Wattman's moonshine operation, the narrator refers to the ""recurrent new reform-administration sheriff"" in Yoknapatawpha who hopes to raid it (244).  ""Sheriff"" is singular.  ""Recurrent,"" however, suggests more than one sheriff.  And there's no way to tell if in Faulkner's imagination any of these sheriffs are named Hampton or Bishop, the county sheriffs who are named in the novel.  Moreover, the tone of the passage implies that if their ""administration"" is overtly committed to ""reform,"" the sheriffs themselves are happy with the status quo: they ""notify [Jake] that he had to be raided again"" in time for him to remove and hide his operation (244).</p>","Yes"

"23621","3542","Unnamed Negro Railroad Porters and Waiters","Unnamed Negro Railroad Porters and Waiters","","<p>Mink Snopes remembers these men near the end of <em>The Mansion</em>, when he recalls the ""New Orleans-bound passenger train"" that he had seen ""thirty-eight or forty-years ago"" at the station in Jefferson and the ""uppity impudent"" Negro porters and Negro waiters he could see through the windows of the cars (445).  Using a term that seems reserved for blacks in the Jim Crow South, Mink thinks of them as ""uppity"" on principle - presumably because they are on the train and he is not.</p>","Yes"
"23620","3541","Unnamed Negro Railroad Fireman","Unnamed Negro Railroad Fireman","","<p>Mink sees the fireman ""crouched dim and high above the hissing steam"" beside the engineer as a night train pulls into the Jefferson station in <em>The Mansion</em> (39).  In this context, the 'fireman' is a man who keeps train's boiler hot by shoveling coal into its firebox.   The text itself provides no further information him, but given the historical patterns of the segregated South and the 'firemen' who appear elsewhere in Faulkner's fictions, it seems safe to assume the man Mink sees is a Negro.</p>","Yes"
"23619","3540","Unnamed Negro Principal","Unnamed Negro Principal","","<p>The principal of Jefferson's Negro school in <em>The Mansion</em> is a ""college-bred man"" and, according to Gavin Stevens, a person ""of intelligence and devotion too"" (247).  In his role as narrator of Chapter 9, Charles Mallison seconds Gavin's words, describing the principal as an ""intelligent dedicated man with [a] composed and tragic face"" (248). Along with the school's ""senior woman teacher,"" he tries to explain to Linda Snopes Kohl why her plan to improve education for blacks is misguided (247).</p>","Yes"

"23615","3536","Unnamed Negro Wife of Cotton Farmer","Unnamed Negro Wife of Cotton Farmer","","<p>The wife of the cotton farmer in <em>The Mansion</em> works with him and the whole family picking cotton, and then, with her daughter, she prepares supper according to the etiquette of Jim Crow - that is, first she serves the meal for Mink Snopes to eat alone, and then ""the meal for the family"" (440).</p>","Yes"
"23614","3535","Unnamed Negro Cotton Farmer","Unnamed Negro Cotton Farmer","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> this cotton farmer allows Mink to work and stay the night at his place.

"23613","3534","Unnamed Negro Carriage Driver 4","Unnamed Negro Carriage Driver 4","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> this ""Negro coachman"" drives the young Melisandre Backus ""in a victoria"" (217).  (This revises the way Faulkner represented Melisandre and her father's life in ""Knight's Gambit""; there, although he's a planter, Mr. Backus uses a ""barefoot"" field hand rather than a domestic servant to drive his daughter, and a 'victoria' carriage is much more elegant than anything Backus would own, 245.)</p>","Yes"

The Communist Party USA was a major political element during the Great Depression, working both to advance the interests of the Soviet Union and to improve the lives of American workers and blacks; it also organized the Lincoln Brigade to fight the Fascists (as Linda and her husband did) during the Spanish Civil War.  As an organized party, it was essentially made illegal by the Smith Act in 1940, though fear of communism and communists was a major element in the politics of the 1950s.</p>","No"
"23606","3527","Unnamed Members of Jehovah's Shareholders","Unnamed Members of Jehovah's Shareholders","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em>, ""Jehovah's Shareholders"" is the name of a religious sect inside Parchman's Penitentiary (111).  According to the novel's narrator, it was ""headed by self-ordained leaders who had reached prison through a curiously consistent pattern: by the conviction of crimes peculiar to the middle class, to respectability, originating in domesticity or anyway uxoriousness"" (111).  Again according to the narrator, it is typical of ""the small violent irreconcilable non-conformist non-everything and -everybody else"" unofficial religious groups that could be found ""in probably all Southern rural penitentiaries"" (111).</p>","No"

"23604","3525","Unnamed Army Sergeant 1","Unnamed Army Sergeant 1","","<p>According to the highly fictionalized if not entirely false account Strutterbuck provides about his experience in World War I in <em>The Mansion</em>, his hopes of getting the job driving General Pershing were thwarted by ""a Sergeant Somebody, I forget his name"" (84).</p>","No"
"23603","3524","Unnamed Marine","Unnamed Marine","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Dad mentions this ""mama's boy"" when he tells Mink about Goodyhay's experiences during World War II.

"23602","3523","Unnamed Mail Clerk","Unnamed Mail Clerk","","<p>In his speculations in <em>The Mansion</em> about the source of the anonymous letter accusing Linda of being a Communist, Gavin imagines and then dismisses this ""mail clerk"" at Parchman as a possible source of information, assuming anyone in that position would probably not be very competent at keeping track of the mail (269).</p>","No"
"23601","3522","Unnamed Landowner","Unnamed Landowner","","<p>This man owns the land on which Goodyhay wants to build his ""chapel"" in <em>The Mansion</em>;  he has ""changed his mind,"" or, Albert speculates, had it changed for him by ""the bank that holds the mortgage"" or maybe ""the American Legion"" (303).</p>","No"
"23600","3521","Unnamed Landlords","Unnamed Landlords","","<p>The ""landlord"" Mink thinks about in <em>The Mansion</em> while serving his prison sentence in Parchman is a composite figure, made up of the various property owners who over the years have hired and fired him and his family as tenant farmers (102).</p>","Yes"
"23599","3520","Unnamed Kin of Mink Snopes' Wife","Unnamed Kin of Mink Snopes' Wife","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Mink's wife Yetti goes back to her ""people"" after he is sent to jail (104).  (Faulkner seems to have forgotten the biography he created in <em>The Hamlet</em> for the woman whom Mink marries and brings to Yoknapatawpha; if you take that earlier account into account, it's extremely difficult to imagine who her ""people"" might be.  See the entry for Yettie Snopes in this index.)</p>","Yes"
"23598","3519","Unnamed Grand Jury Foreman 2","Unnamed Grand Jury Foreman 2","","<p>The foreman of the ""Grand Jury"" that found Mink guilty in <em>The Mansion</em> is in later life ""a hale (hence still quick) eighty-five""; he runs ""a small electric-driven corn-mill"" but also spends a lot of time ""hunting and fishing with Uncle Ike McCaslin"" (407).

The narrative says they were ""outraged and seething of course, but helpless"" - what they are outraged <em>at</em>, however, seems to be the fact that the house belongs to ""THE banker"" (252).  (Faulkner usually identifies the police in Yoknapatawpha as sheriffs, deputies and marshals, but the term 'police' becomes more common in his later fictions; this use of the term 'cops' is even rarer.)</p>","Yes"
"23595","3516","Unnamed Negroes in Jefferson 2","Unnamed Negroes in Jefferson 2","","<p>Jefferson's African-American population appears in <em>The Mansion</em> indirectly, in several narrative references to them as a group and from several different political perspectives.  On his trip into Jefferson at the beginning of the novel, for example, Mink walks through a ""section [of] all Negro homes"" (38) between the Square and the railroad depot; his thoughts seem to include the actual 'Negroes' who live in these homes, though no people come clearly into focus.  Later on the novel mentions the ""small dingy back- and side-street stores which cater mostly to Negroes"" (362), but also mentions that by the mid-1940s ""the Negroes"" have a ""newer and better high school building in Jefferson than the white folks had"" (385).  Both the town's socialist tinsmith and Charles Mallison make generalized assumptions about the ""Negroes"" who live in Jefferson.  To the tinsmith, a new arrival from Finland, these ""Negroes"" are imagined as a ""proletariat,"" good ""material"" among whom he can recruit ""converts"" to the communist cause (237).  Charles, on the other hand, thinks of the African-American population as ""our own loyal colored,"" who will not be interested in radical ideas (238).</p>","Yes"
"23594","3515","Unnamed Japanese Troops","Unnamed Japanese Troops","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> these Japanese troops attack the retreating group of Americans as well as ""Aussies, British, French from Indo-China"" somewhere in ""Malaya"" at the start of the Second World War (305).  They are never seen, but readers hear them ""chirping"" in the dark just beyond a line of American foxholes.  Their ""English"" is the stereotypical dialect that once was spoken by Asians in (white) American popular culture: ""Maline"" (i.e. Marine), ""Tonigh youdigh"" (306).  Their attack begins with beheading a Negro soldier and tossing his head forward ""like somebody throwing a basket ball"" (306).</p>","No"
"23593","3514","Unnamed Young Girl","Unnamed Young Girl","","<p>Ratliff hypothesizes in <em>The Mansion</em> that one of the young men in Frenchman's Bend might ""persuade"" a young girl on a Wednesday night to go ""off into the bushes before her paw or maw noticed she was missing"" (134).</p>","No"
"23592","3513","Unnamed Wife of Gavin Stevens","Unnamed Wife of Gavin Stevens","","<p>According to Charles in <em>The Mansion</em>, Ratliff expects that ""some woman"" will come along one day and marry Gavin Stevens, after deciding that he is ""dependable enough at last for steady work in place of merely an occasional chore"" (215).</p>","No"
"23591","3512","Unnamed White Soldier","Unnamed White Soldier","","<p>Clarence Snopes invents this soldier as part of his smear campaign against Devries in <em>The Mansion</em>, spreading the rumor that during the war Devries chose to save the Negro soldier and left this white one to die (345).</p>","No"
"23590","3511","Unnamed Doctor in Veterans Hospital","Unnamed Doctor in Veterans Hospital","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em>, as part of his cover story about spending a year in the ""Govment Vetruns Hospital"" in Memphis, Mink claims that a doctor there told him walking was good for him, and that's why he is ""on the road instead of the train"" (439).</p>","No"

"23588","3509","Unnamed Spies 2","Unnamed Spies 2","","<p>According to Gavin's musings in <em>The Mansion</em>, Jason's behavior might make one ""almost believe"" that he had spies in both ""the Japanese Diet"" and ""the U.S. Cabinet too,"" as he seems to have advance knowledge of the coming war and the air training field that would be built in Jefferson (356).  (""Diet"" in this context is the name of the legislative branch of the Japanese government.)</p>","No"
"23587","3508","Unnamed Spies 1","Unnamed Spies 1","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Ratliff speculates that Flem has ""spies"" that watch Montgomery Ward's business. He imagines them as children, moreover, ""since any little child hired with a ice cream cone"" would suit Flem's needs (62).</p>","No"
"23586","3507","Unnamed Sheriff 14","Unnamed Sheriff 14","","<p>After his experience with crime and punishment, the first time Mink buys a ""soft drink"" in <em>The Mansion</em> he imagines a sheriff will ""come for him"" if he takes the change from his purchase (287).</p>","No"

"23583","3504","Unnamed Husband of Linda","Unnamed Husband of Linda","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> The question of Linda Snopes' romantic future is answered several times, at least hypothetically, by the 'husbands' that Ratliff and Gavin imagine she'll marry some day. In the first such musing, Ratliff describes how Stevens imagines that Linda will leave Jefferson and marry ""the first strange young man that happens by"" (153). On another occasion, Ratliff and Stevens together speculate about whether Linda has already met her future husband during her first two or three days in the ""Grinnich Village"" (169).</p>","No"
"23582","3503","Unnamed Daughter of Mink","Unnamed Daughter of Mink","","<p>Mink has two actual daughters; this ""daughter"" who lives in ""the Delta"" is one he invents in <em>The Mansion</em> to keep the Negro cotton farmer from identifying him (439).</p>","No"
"23581","3502","Unnamed Daughter of Linda Snopes Kohl","Unnamed Daughter of Linda Snopes Kohl","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Ratliff wonders, facetiously, whether Linda has a daughter ""stashed out somewhere"" - because he knows that given Gavin's obsession with Eula Varner Snopes and <em>her</em> daughter Linda, another female Snopes would be too much for him to deal with (476).</p>","No"
"23580","3501","Unnamed Negro Employees of the Holston House 2","Unnamed Negro Employees of the Holston House 2","","<p>In keeping with entrenched traditions, the Holston House in <em>The Mansion</em> still has ""Negro man waiters,"" some of whom are the sons of previous generations of waiters (421), and in the ladies dressing room there is ""a maid"" (422).</p>","Yes"

"23577","3498","Unnamed Guests at Holston House","Unnamed Guests at Holston House","","<p>According to <em>The Mansion</em>, male ""guests"" staying at the Holston House are required to wear ""a coat and necktie"" in the dining room, while women guests must have their ""heads covered"" (421).  The only guests whom the novel specifically identifies, however, are ""drummers"" - i.e. traveling salesmen - and they are all men (37).</p>","Yes"
"23576","3497","Unnamed Guests at Backus Plantation","Unnamed Guests at Backus Plantation","","<p>In a passage in <em>The Mansion</em> that provides a rare glimpse into Stevens' life after he marries the wealthy Melisandre Backus Harriss, the narrator describes his discomfort whenever ""guests, even the same guest or guests again,"" came to dinner (399).</p>","Yes"

"23574","3495","Unnamed Grandson of Will Varner","Unnamed Grandson of Will Varner","","<p>The only thing said about Varner's grandson in <em>The Mansion</em> is that he had a love interest whom the eighty-year old Varner ended up marrying himself.</p>","Yes"
"23573","3494","Unnamed Governors of Mississippi","Unnamed Governors of Mississippi","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Mink's lawyer speculates that after Mink gets to the penitentiary, a meddler with ""access to the Governor's ear"" may be able to secure his early release (50). Almost four decades later, a different Governor approves Mink's petition for freedom (408).  (The actual Governors of Mississippi in 1908 and 1946 were, respectively, James Kimble Vardaman and Thomas Lowry Bailey.</p>","No"
"23572","3493","Unnamed German Aviators 2","Unnamed German Aviators 2","","<p><em>The Mansion</em> goes back to the story of the Sartoris twins in World War I and adds a detail to John Sartoris' resume: fighting with the ""Royal Flying Corps"" in World War I (204), John shot down ""three huns"" (212) in combat.   (""Huns"" - usually capitalized - was the derogatory term the Allies used for their German opponents.)</p>","No"
"23571","3492","Unnamed Husband of Former Prostitute","Unnamed Husband of Former Prostitute","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> the story of the dead man who was married to the former prostitute in Goodyhay's congregation is told in matter-of-fact terms in a couple pages by Albert, a member of the congregation.  Albert says nothing about how he married his wife, but describes how he decided to kill himself during the fighting at the start of the Second World War.  He is a Lieutenant in command of an infantry platoon falling back as part of the confused retreat in ""Malaya"" (a British colony on the Malay Peninsula, 305).  During a night on picket duty in a foxhole he is joined by an untrained and ""new"" Negro supply soldier whom he leaves alone ""to report to the p.c. or something"" (306).  In his absence the soldier is killed and beheaded by the Japanese; as soon as possible after that, when the retreat is at least temporarily halted, the Lieutenant ""puts his pistol barrel in his mouth"" (307).</p>","No"
"23570","3491","Unnamed Former Prostitute","Unnamed Former Prostitute","","<p>This woman in <em>The Mansion</em> used to work in a ""Catalpa Street house"" (305), an address that means she was a prostitute in one of the many brothels in Memphis.  According to Albert, ""she looks a little like a whore yet,"" but after her husband died in World War II, she became a member of Goodyhay's eccentric congregation (305).</p>","No"
"23569","3490","Unnamed Finnish Immigrants","Unnamed Finnish Immigrants","","<p>These two Finns in <em>The Mansion</em> are among the more exotic inhabitants of Jefferson.  They escaped ""from Russia in 1917"" and then ""from Europe in 1919"" (236).  The 1917 Russian Revolution produced a lot of refugees and set off a civil war in neighboring Finland, but the text does not provide any details about what these two Finns were doing in Russia or why they had to ""escape"" from Europe when they did.  ""In the early twenties"" they arrive in Jefferson, where one becomes a cobbler, taking over Nightingale's shop, and the other a tinsmith.  The narrative refers to them as ""communists"" (236); because they see the Negroes in the South as the ""proletariat"" (237), the pair support Linda Kohl in her efforts to improve their social condition.</p>","Yes"
"23568","3489","Unnamed Wife of Parchman Trusty","Unnamed Wife of Parchman Trusty","Unnamed Father-in-Law of Trusty","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> the trusty in Parchman is a ""lifer"" - someone sentenced to life imprisonment - for killing ""his wife with a ball peen hammer"" (423).

"23567","3488","Unnamed Father-in-Law of Trusty","Unnamed Father-in-Law of Trusty","","<p>""The gal's paw"" (424) - that is how Ratliff refers in <em>The Mansion</em> to the father of the wife whom the penitentiary trusty had killed.  This man has ""swore he would kill [the trusty] the first time he crossed the Parchman fence"" (424).</p>","No"
"23566","3487","Unnamed Employees at Allanovna's","Unnamed Employees at Allanovna's","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> as Gavin and Ratliff walk through Allanovna's store on their way to her office, they see ""two ladies in black dresses and a man dressed like a congressman or at least a preacher""; that this well-dressed group are clerks becomes clear when they recognize Gavin as a former customer (186).</p>","No"
"23565","3486","Unnamed Eleven-Year-Old Girl","Unnamed Eleven-Year-Old Girl","","<p>In the chapter he narrates in <em>The Mansion</em>, Montgomery Ward refers to this girl when, in a passage summing up the scoundrels in his family, he talks about ""Uncle Wesley leading a hymn with one hand and fumbling the skirt of an eleven-year-old infant with the other"" (93).  In <em>The Town</em> Wesley is caught having sex with a fourteen-year-old, so it is certainly possible that Monty is referring to a real event and victim, but it seems more probable that, as in his use of the word ""infant,"" Monty is inventing or exaggerating here.  (The 'Unnamed Fourteen-Year-Old Girl' in the earlier novel has her own character entry.)</p>","Yes"
"23564","3485","Unnamed Deputized ""Boys""","Unnamed Deputized ""Boys""","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> the Sheriff deputizes ""two boys at Varner's store"" to keep a look out for Mink Snopes (434). ""Boys"" of course is a colloquial southern term for lower class men - as in 'good ole boys' - and these ""boys"" must be full-grown men, since they claim to ""remember"" Mink from before he went to prison.  (In the same vocabulary, ""boy"" is also a derogatory term for adult black men, but it's not likely that blacks would be ""at Varner's store"" - and even less likely that they would be given an unofficial job in law enforcement.)</p>","Yes"

"23559","3480","Unnamed Congregants at Goodyhay's Church","Unnamed Congregants at Goodyhay's Church","","<p>The congregants in Goodyhay's church in <em>The Mansion</em> are mostly ex-soldiers and their wives or mistresses; one of the men wears a ""barracks cap still showing where the officer's badge had been removed"" (305), and another refers to the group as ""ex-drafted sons of bitches"" (300).  But the group also includes ""the moms and pops of soldiers that got killed"" (295) as well as the men who help to build at the two church sites. Mink later observes ""the two oldish couples, man and wife of course, farmers obviously, without doubt tenant-farmers come up from the mortgaged bank- or syndicate-owned cotton plantation from which the son had been drafted"" (310).  ""A dozen"" of the men in this group appear working to build a meeting house for the sect (304), and as a group they have clearly been alienated from more conventional society by their experiences of World War II.

Montgomery Ward Snopes says Strutterbuck ""even got his name out a book"" (86), but it's not clear what book Mink might be thinking of, and the money order he gives Miss Reba proves Strutterbuck's last name is real.  Most of the rest of his story, however, rings false, including the military rank he claims and the stories he tells about his service in World War I.

Historically it has worked to secure veterans' rights.  In  <em>The Mansion</em> it is seen both positively and critically.  Gavin is thinking of it when he talks about how ""the Veterans' clubs and legions"" provide ""refuge"" for the men who fought in the First World War only to find themselves feeling alienated, ""betrayed and dispossessed"" when they returned to the U.S. (201).  But the World War II veterans in Goodyhay's congregation who are trying to build their own place of refuge think ""the American Legion"" may be behind their being driven off the building site (303).

"23505","3426","Marvin Hait","Hait, Marvin","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Marvin Hait is ""our local horse-and-mule trader"" (202).  He may be the same character as Hait, the mule trader who appears in ""Mule in the Yard,"" and Lonzo Hait, as he is named in <em>The Town</em>, but the 'corrected text' of <em>The Mansion</em> says nothing to make that more or less likely.  (On the other hand, in their one volume edition of the Snopes trilogy the editors at Random House changed Hait's first name in <em>The Mansion</em> from Marvin to Lonzo.)</p>","Yes"

His wife reportedly ""ran off"" with a salesman while Goodyhay was at war (294).  He is described in <em>The Mansion</em> as ""a lean quick-moving man in the middle thirties with coldly seething eyes and the long upper lip of a lawyer or an orator and the long chin of the old-time comic strip Puritan"" (293).  According to his mailbox, Goodyhay's initials are ""J C"" (292), which links him to the Jesus Christ he sees in his vision - and also to Faulkner's Joe Christmas.  In Christmas' case, the association with Jesus seems essentially ironic, but Goodyhay is one of the few preachers in the fictions whom Faulkner treats with respect.</p>","No"
"23502","3423","Gihon","Gihon","","<p>Gihon is a federal agent of ""no particular age between twenty-five and fifty"" (259) who appears in <em>The Mansion</em> after ""the police find out"" that Linda Kohl is ""a communist"" (236).</p>","Yes"

"23494","3415","Theodore Bilbo","Bilbo, Theodore","","<p>The man whom Ratliff, facetiously, refers to as ""our own Bilbo in Mississippi"" in <em>The Mansion</em> was a racist and an outspoken supporter of the Jim Crow system of segregation.  He was elected twice as Governor of Mississippi and later three times as a U.S. Senator (179).  Two rural white characters in Yoknapatawpha (Bilbo Snopes and Bilbo Gowrie) were named after him.</p>","No"
"23492","3414","Unnamed County Political Boss","Unnamed County Political Boss","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Luther Biglin's mother is the sister of a ""rural political boss whose iron hand ruled one of the county divisions"" (448).  The division is not Frenchman's Bend, because this man's rule is compared to Will Varner's ""at Frenchman's Bend,"" but we cannot say what other part of the county it is (448).  This boss helped elect Sheriff Bishop, and so Bishop gives his wife's son (Luther) the job of county jailer.</p>","Yes"

"23489","3411","Luther Biglin","Biglin, Luther","Unnamed Mother of Luther Biglin","<p>Luther appears in two different roles in <em>The Mansion</em>.  He is mentioned as the best bird shot in the county who ""shot left-handed"" (228).

"23488","3410","Jake Barron","Barron, Jake","","<p>One of the prisoners at Parchman penitentiary when Mink is there in <em>The Mansion</em>, Jake Barron has ""most of his head blown off"" when he tries to escape (107).</p>","No"

"23486","3408","Mrs. Allison","Allison, Mrs.","","<p>""The only sister of old Major de Spain,"" Mrs. Allison in <em>The Mansion</em> is ""a bed-ridden old woman living in Los Angeles"" (463).  She and her daughter end up owning 'the mansion' after which the novel is named.

"23485","3407","Miss Allison","Allison, Miss","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Miss Allison is the spinster daughter of Old Major de Spain's sister and ""the retired principal of a suburban Los Angeles grammar school"" (463).

"23484","3406","Myra Allanovna","Allanovna, Myra","","<p>Myra Allanovna in <em>The Mansion</em> is the Russian immigrant proprietor of an upscale New York store where she sells the neckties she designs.  She is described by Ratliff as ""a short dumpy dark woman in a dress that wouldn't a fitted nobody,"" but he adds that she has ""the handsomest dark eyes I ever seen even if they popped a little"" (186).   (Faulkner almost certainly bases this character on Lucilla Mara de Vescovi, an Italian immigrant who opened Countess Mara, a men's neckwear company, in New York in the early 1930s; Countess Mara ties are still sold today.)</p>","No"
"23483","3405","Unnamed Second Wife of Zilphia's Husband","Unnamed Second Wife of Zilphia's Husband","","<p>The title character of ""Miss Zilphia Gant"" learns from a newspaper about this woman ""in another state"" who marries the man to whom she herself had been married (379); from the detective agency she hires, Zilphia learns about ""the birth of a daughter and of the mother's death,"" a sequence that suggests this woman died in childbirth (381).  Although from the agency's reports Zilphia learns enough about this woman's marriage to live ""vicariously"" inside it (380), what the story passes on to readers is vague and confusing.  For example, at least 13 years before her death this unnamed woman was reported to be pregnant, but the only child mentioned in the text is the daughter who is born at the same time both her parents die.</p>","No"
"23482","3404","Jock","Jock","","<p>In ""Death Drag"" Jock is one of Faulkner's aviators who cannot stay away from airplanes: a former pilot in the Royal Flying Corps who has lost his civilian pilot's license but continues to fly nonetheless.  He is a tall, dashing figure whose stained clothing and unruly hair indicate that he doesn't care about his physical appearance; insomniac and perennially thirsty, he is emotionally tense and self-contained and won't accept offers of help from his former comrade-in-arms, Captain Warren.  Warren thinks the strain of Jock's lifestyle is going to kill him:  ""You aren't going to last long,"" he says (195), meaning Jock will be in jail soon but implying something more dire.</p>","Yes"
"23481","3403","Willow-Bearer","Willow-Bearer","","<p>In ""A Justice"" ""the Willow-Bearer"" - his name never appears without the definite article - apparently performs an undefined ceremonial function related to the selection of the new ""the Man"" - the tribal chief whose title also always includes the ""the"" (349).</p>","Yes"

"23479","3401","Unnamed Son-in-Law of Deacon","Unnamed Son-in-Law of Deacon","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Deacon tells Quentin that the reason he marched in the parade ""on that Wop holiday"" (presumably Columbus Day, 98) was to help his son-in-law ""get a job on the city forces"" as a ""street cleaner"" (98).  Deacon also calls him ""that son of a bitch,"" and implies he's very lazy (99).</p>","Yes"
"23478","3400","Shreve MacKenzie|McCannon","Shreve MacKenzie|McCannon","","<p>Shreve is Quentin Compson's Canadian roommate at Harvard in two of Faulkner's greatest novels: <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (where his last name is MacKenzie) and <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> (where it's McCannon).  In the first novel he's largely defined by his concern for Quentin's well-being, which apparently leads some of their fellow students in the novel (and has definitely led a few critics writing about the novel) to speculate that the bond between them may be homoerotic. There is no clear evidence of that in the text, but his anxiety about Quentin leads Shreve, for instance, to offer to return to the campus with Quentin after the fight with Gerald Bland.  Shreve does not, however, suspect that Quentin is planning to commit suicide.  In <em>Absalom!</em> his relationship with Quentin is defined more particularly by the structural and thematic needs of the story Faulkner is writing about the South and its legacies.   As someone who's never been further south than Massachusetts, for example, Shreve's provides a different perspective on the story Quentin brings with him when he travels <em>north</em> to Massachusetts.   Shreve's attitude toward the story is often flippant, even sarcastic, which the narrator refers to ""that incorrigible unsentimental sentimentality of the young which takes the form of hard and often crass levity"" (221).   As a Canadian, Shreve says that history is ""something my people haven't got"" (289): he is described at one point listening to Quentin ""with intent detached speculation and curiosity"" (206).   He teases Quentin about the South (""It's better than the theatre, isn't it,"" 176), but does get caught up in the questions raised by the Sutpens.  And what he and Quentin share, especially as youths, often produces moments of almost mystical communion between them and (apparently) with the past, especially with the two young men in the story, Henry and Bon, who of course meet at college too.  In the ""Genealogy"" that Faulkner includes at the end of <em>Absalom!</em> we learn that Shreve's full name is Shrevlin - and that he is the only character in the novel who is known to be still alive.</p>","No"

He looks at Flem ""with envy and respect (ay, and hatred too)"" for having ""wrenched himself free"" of ""the overalls and the grinding landlord"" that define the costume and the world of a tenant farmer.

The slaves of the Chickasaw who appear in ""A Name for the City"" and again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> are specifically referred to as the slaves of Mohataha, Ikketubbe's mother who rules the tribe in those texts. In the short story and in Act I of the novel, these enslaved people purchase items at the Indian agency-store in the settlement (17).

Charles wonders at their attitude toward the church, ""since they themselves had burned it and blown it up with dynamite in 1863"" (321).

"23432","3355","Unnamed Negro ""Least Boy""","Unnamed Negro ""Least Boy""","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> the Jefferson hotel porter named Samson works with someone whom Ratliff refers to as ""Samson's least boy,"" whose one action in the novel is carrying a newspaper for the white bondsman when he leaves the hotel (103).  It's not clear what ""least boy"" means - perhaps he is a bellboy at the hotel or possibly he is Samson's youngest son.</p>","Yes"
"23431","3354","Unnamed Mule Buyers","Unnamed Mule Buyers","","<p>According to <em>The Town</em>, I.O. Snopes sells mules to ""farmers and widows and orphans black and white, for whatever he could get, down to some last irreducible figure"" (245).</p>","Yes"

"23429","3352","Unnamed Members of Frenchman's Bend Church","Unnamed Members of Frenchman's Bend Church","","<p>In his hypothetical account in <em>The Town</em> of Flem's return to Frenchman's Bend in 1927, Gavin mentions the members of the church there, but only in the context of Mrs. Varner's authoritarian control of the ""terrified congregation"" and the ""ministers"" whom she ""selects and chooses and hires"" herself - she ""fires them too when they don't suit her"" (306).  Still according to Gavin, one of these ministers was plowing ""a cotton field"" when she passed by in her buggy and noticed him: she ordered him ""to go home and bathe and change his clothes"" before she ""ordained"" him herself (306).</p>","Yes"
"23428","3351","Unnamed Members of Byron Society","Unnamed Members of Byron Society","","<p>Byron Societies were originally literary groups that met to read and discuss the works of George Gordon, Lord Byron. By the time of <em>The Town</em>, the Jefferson version of the Byron Society was essentially a social club for upper and middle class women.  Like the Cotillion Club, membership in the Society confers social prestige.  Of the Bryon Club, Maggie Mallison says, ""it had been a long time now since anybody listened to anybody read anything because they played bridge now but at least she said that when it met with Miss Jenny Du Pre they had toddies or juleps instead of just coffee or coca colas"" (325).</p>","Yes"

"23425","3348","Unnamed Jewish Families","Unnamed Jewish Families","","<p>As exceptions to his portrait of the local population in <em>The Town</em> as Protestant (""Baptists and Methodists,"" 320), Charles mentions these ""two Jews brothers with their families, who ran two clothing stores"":  ""One of them had been trained in Russia to be a rabbi and spoke seven languages including classic Greek and Latin and worked geometry problems for relaxation"" (320).    These are the only Jewish inhabitants of Yoknapatawpha ever mentioned.</p>","Yes"
"23424","3347","Unnamed Jefferson Ministers 2","Unnamed Jefferson Ministers 2","","<p>In <em>The Town</em>, along with the Episcopalian minister Mr. Thorndyke, these three ""pastors"" - identified as ""the Methodist, the Baptist, the Presbyterian"" - call on Gavin Stevens at the request of their congregations to offer Gavin their assistance with Eula's memorial service. Gavin calls them all ""Doctor"" (359), but in the distribution of names Charles' narration clearly distinguishes between the Episcopalian and the other three; Charles calls Thorndyke as ""our"" pastor - i.e. his family goes to the Episcopal church, throughout Faulkner's fictions the church where the upper class worships (358).  But it's also fair to say that those other three Protestant denominations are usually associated in the fictions with the lower classes, and with a more conservative, not to say fundamentalist form of Christianity.</p>","Yes"
"23423","3346","Unnamed Jefferson Mothers","Unnamed Jefferson Mothers","","<p>The ""mothers"" of Jefferson appear as a distinct group several times in <em>The Town</em>.  They bring their little children to the kindergarten class in which Wallstreet Panic and Admiral Dewey Snopes are already enrolled, for example.  We also use this entry to refer to the larger group that Gavin refers to as ""Southern mothers"" - the women who want ""their daughters"" to attend college in Virginia (221).</p>","Yes"
"23422","3345","Unnamed Jefferson Masons","Unnamed Jefferson Masons","","<p>A secret fraternal order originating in medieval ritual, the Masons advocate charity and obedience.  In <em>The Town</em> Eck Snopes was an active member among the Frenchman's Bend Masons, and Will Varner encouraged the Masons in Jefferson to find an appropriate job for Eck after his neck was broken. When Eck dies, the Masonic Lodge buries him, displaying their ritual ""aprons"" and ""signs"" at his funeral (117).</p>","Yes"
"23421","3344","Unnamed Jefferson Lady 2","Unnamed Jefferson Lady 2","","<p>This is the woman in <em>The Town</em> - identified only as ""the second lady""  - who condescendingly reproves Maggie Mallison for calling on Eula Snopes (53).</p>","Yes"

"23414","3337","Unnamed Imaginary Assassin","Unnamed Imaginary Assassin","","<p>In Chapter 17 of <em>The Town</em> Gavin refers, hypothetically, to ""some dedicated enthusiast panting for martyrdom in the simple name of Man"" whom Flem could get to ""shoot old Will some night"" (302).  The context suggests that this potential solution to Flem's problem is invented by Gavin as much if not more than by Flem.</p>","No"
"23413","3336","Unnamed Husbands and Beaus of the Ladies in the Club","Unnamed Husbands and Beaus of the Ladies in the Club","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> these ""husbands and beaus"" reluctantly bought at least one corsage for their Cotillion Club partners, following Gavin's example (73).</p>","Yes"
"23412","3335","Unnamed Hired Driver 3","Unnamed Hired Driver 3","","<p>Unlike the other drivers in <em>The Town</em>, this one is imaginary.  In his hypothetical account of Flem's trip to Frenchman's Bend in Chapter 17, Gavin describes the man who drives him as an outsider: his car ""would not bear Yoknapatawpha County license plates"" (305).  (In Chapter 18, Ratliff describes how he himself drove Flem on that trip.)</p>","Yes"

"23408","3331","Unnamed Grandfather of Uncle Willy","Unnamed Grandfather of Uncle Willy","","<p>According to <em>The Town</em>, before the Civil War, Willy Christian's grandfather owned Walter's grandfather.  The employer-employee relationship described in the novel between Willy and Walter has affinities with this master-slave relationship.  (See also Hoke Christian's entry in this index.  He is Willy's father in the story ""Uncle Willy,"" and may have been the man Faulkner was thinking of when he created a grandfather for Willy.)</p>","Yes"
"23407","3330","Unnamed Biracial Concubines","Unnamed Biracial Concubines","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Ratliff reports that Will Varner had three ""mulatto concubines"" - the ""first Negroes"" in Frenchman's Bend, ""and for a time the only ones [Varner] would permit there"" (289).</p>","Yes"

"23401","3324","Unnamed Minister in Frenchman's Bend","Unnamed Minister in Frenchman's Bend","","<p>The minister who leads Eula's memorial service in Jefferson in <em>The Town</em> is ""the old Methodist minister who had christened her thirty-eight years ago"" in Frenchman's Bend; he is described as ""an old man who had been a preacher all his adult life but would have for the rest of it the warped back and the wrenched bitter hands of a dirt farmer"" (360).

(The first American chapters of the social order known as Freemasonry were organized in Pennsylvania in the early 18th century.  Many of the Founders of the Revolutionary era were Freemasons, which is why the U.S. dollar includes masonic symbolism.  Not long after the Revolution ended there were 'lodges' in all the states, but I confess it's surprising to think that such a small and impoverished place as Frenchman's Bend had its own chapter.)</p>","Yes"
"23399","3322","Unnamed French Prostitutes","Unnamed French Prostitutes","","<p>As Ratliff explains to Charles in <em>The Town</em>, during World War I Montgomery Ward Snopes ran brothels in France.  He began in a little town with ""a young French lady he happened to know"" (120; since Charles is only five at the time, Ratliff resorts to evasive terms), then set up a bigger brothel in Paris, ""adding more and more entertaining ladies to that-ere new canteen he set up in Paris"" (121).  The ladies themselves are not described in any more detail.  (Prostitution was legal in France at this time, though it was illegal to run a brothel.)</p>","No"
"23398","3321","Unnamed Fourteen-Year-Old Girl","Unnamed Fourteen-Year-Old Girl","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> this girl is discovered in an ""empty cotton house"" having sex with ""schoolmaster"" Snopes (43).  (See also the Unnamed Eleven-Year-Old Girl who appears in <em>The Mansion</em>, and may be the same character.)</p>","Yes"
"23397","3320","Unnamed Residents of the Poorhouse 2","Unnamed Residents of the Poorhouse 2","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> these poor people, who are housed by the county, know about Mr. Hait's death and have ""heard that Mrs. Hait had got eight thousand dollars for him"" (242).</p>","Yes"
"23396","3319","Unnamed Fish-Grabblers","Unnamed Fish-Grabblers","","<p>'Fish grabbling' means catching fish underwater with one's bare hands.  That's what these men in <em>The Town</em> are doing when they find Mink Snopes' shotgun in the slough where he had thrown it.  (See also Unnamed Negro Who Finds Gun in this index.)</p>","Yes"
"23395","3318","Unnamed Fiance of Miss Wyott","Unnamed Fiance of Miss Wyott","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Miss Vaiden Wyott mentions ""her fiance"" when she explains to Wall Snopes why she cannot accept his marriage proposal; all the text says about him is that she is sure that, if he and Wall ever met, they ""would be friends"" (154).</p>","Yes"
"23394","3317","Unnamed Federal Drug Inspectors","Unnamed Federal Drug Inspectors","","<p>The federal drug inspectors who audit the narcotics in Uncle Willy's drugstore in <em>The Town</em> criticize him for his poor security of the morphine (163).</p>","Yes"
"23393","3316","Unnamed Father-in-Law of Wallstreet Snopes","Unnamed Father-in-Law of Wallstreet Snopes","","<p>Gavin speculates in <em>The Town</em> that this ""small though thrifty farmer"" (157) finds the money to save his son-in-law's business.</p>","Yes"
"23392","3315","Unnamed Directors of the Bank of Jefferson","Unnamed Directors of the Bank of Jefferson","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Ratliff mentions ""the directors of the Bank of Jefferson"" - the other bank in town, rival to the Sartoris Bank - when he tells Gavin about Wallstreet Panic Snopes' business plans (152): they apparently authorized a loan to him.</p>","Yes"
"23391","3314","Unnamed Baptists and Methodists","Unnamed Baptists and Methodists","","<p>The narrators in <em>The Town</em> refer in several ways to the morally self-righteous members of the community.  They can be found among the Presbyterian and Episcopal congregations in Yoknapatawpha, but Baptists and Methodists are the county's principal white Protestant groups.  Charles notes, for example, that ""ours was a town founded by Aryan Baptists and Methodists"" (320; there is no ""Aryan"" sect in the Baptist church - Faulkner may have meant 'Arian Baptists,' but if ""Aryan"" is deliberate, he is presumably using the adjective to mean 'white' or even 'white-supremacist').  What he means by ""Baptists and Methodists"" is clearer when he says later that even ""the most Methodist and Baptist of the Baptists and Methodists and Presbyterians - all right, Episcopals too"" can occasionally be ""kind"" (357).  The novel, however, does not stress their compassion, but their lack of it.  What Ratliff means by ""our good God-fearing upright embattled christian Jeffersons and Yoknapatawphas"" (368) is the same as what Montgomery Ward Snopes, the local pornographer, means by ""the God-fearing christian holy citizens of Jefferson"" (172): people who are very willing to cast the first stone.</p>","Yes"
"23390","3309","Unnamed Station Agent 3","Unnamed Station Agent 3","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Ratliff claims it was ""the depot agent"" who sent I.O. Snopes a printed train schedule - though he may have done that himself. (In ""Mule in the Yard"" the local man who sends I.O. the schedule is identified as the ""town wag."")  It is definitely an agent at the station, and so presumably the same man, who takes Flem Snopes' payment for freight charges on Eula's medallion.</p>","Yes"
"23389","3308","Unnamed Deceased Sheriff","Unnamed Deceased Sheriff","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Sheriff Hub Hampton's ""office deputy,"" Miss Elma, is identified as the ""widow of the sheriff Mr Hampton had succeeded last time"" (183).  This previous sheriff is not otherwise described.</p>","Yes"
"23388","3307","Unnamed Debtors","Unnamed Debtors","","<p>In Chapter 17 of <em>The Town</em> Gavin refers several times to the people who owe Flem Snopes money.  He describes them variously as people owing ""sums ranging from twenty-five cents to five dollars"" (291); as people ""who had been paying [Flem] the usury on five or ten or twenty dollar loans"" (295); and as people against whom Flem holds ""a usurious note or mortage"" (299).  No such people appear directly in the novel, although according to Gavin, Flem thinks at one point about using this leverage to get people to withdraw money from the Sartoris bank, and at another point, about using it to drive his daughter's potential suitors away.</p>","Yes"
"23387","3306","Unnamed Spectators in Courtroom 3","Unnamed Spectators in Courtroom 3","","<p>A large crowd comes to watch Mink Snopes' trial for murder in <em>The Town</em>; people are ""still crowding in long after they had run out of anything to set on"" (86).</p>","Yes"
"23386","3305","Unnamed Countrywomen","Unnamed Countrywomen","","<p>In <em>The Town</em>, Gavin refers to the women - groups of ""four or five or six ladies in sunbonnets"" who live on ""back-country roads"" (240) - as the customers to whom Ratliff sells sewing machines, and from whom he has learned how to listen.  Gavin's use of ""ladies"" is generous; these are the wives of the poor farmers who inhabit Yoknapatawpha's ""back-country"" in the fictions.</p>","Yes"
"23385","3304","Unnamed Countrymen 2","Unnamed Countrymen 2","","<p>In <em>The Town</em>, the potential customers asking for directions to the Snopes Hotel are ""country men"" - men from the countryside outside Jefferson - who ""were told simply to walk in that direction until they came to a woman rocking, and that was it"" (42).  (The woman is I.O. Snopes' wife.  Faulkner here spells ""country men"" as two words, but our name spells it as one word, which Faulkner himself did elsewhere; see Unnamed Countrymen 1, for example, in this index.)</p>","Yes"
"23384","3303","Unnamed Country Girl","Unnamed Country Girl","","<p>After Linda Snopes stops going out with Matt Levitt in <em>The Town</em>, he replaces her with ""a country girl he had found somewhere"" (206).</p>","Yes"
"23383","3302","Unnamed Cotillion Guests","Unnamed Cotillion Guests","","<p>The Jefferson couples who receive invitations to the Cotillion Dance in <em>The Town</em> represent the town's social elite.  Charles describes their appearance as ""crimped and frizzed in scarves and earrings and perfume and long white gloves like Mother or in claw-hammer coats and boiled shirts and white ties and yesterday's haircuts like Father and Uncle Gavin"" (75-76).</p>","Yes"
"23381","3301","Unnamed Confederate Provost Man|Picket","Unnamed Confederate Provost Man|Picket","","<p>Ab Snopes' Civil War wound was never received in battle, or even from a Yankee, but Faulkner provides several different accounts of the Confederate who shot him while he was stealing a horse and left him with a lifelong limp.  In ""Barn Burning"" that man is identified as ""a Confederate provost's man"" (5).  We are assuming this is the same person who shoots him in two other texts, which provide slightly different versions of Ab's wounding.  In one of the two (contradictory) versions offered in <em>The Hamlet</em>, he is shot by ""somebody that never even owned the horses"" he was trying to steal (32) - which suggests a soldier standing guard over them, like a 'picket.'  In the (also contradictory) version provided by <em>The Town</em>, Ab is explicitly shot by a Confederate ""picket"" (5) - that is, someone posted outside an encampment near enemy troops- but then in the next chapter, by a ""provost-marshal"" (43; provost marshals and their men served as a military police force behind the lines).   And it has to be mentioned that in the first account of Ab's wound in <em>The Hamlet</em>, it's ""Colonel John Sartoris his self"" who shots him in the act of trying to steal a horse (18).  Faulkner mentions Ab's wartime misadventures with the Confederate army five times in three texts, and the details are never the same - <em>The Town</em>'s first account, in fact, says he was hanged.</p>","No"
"23380","3300","Unnamed Jefferson Merchants and Professionals 4","Unnamed Jefferson Merchants and Professionals 4","","<p>These men in <em>The Town</em> are described as Jefferson's ""storekeepers and doctors and lawyers and mayors and such as that""; their ""quiet and peaceful"" suppers are disturbed by the sound of Manfred De Spain's car when he passes by the Mallison house (62).</p>","Yes"
"23379","3299","Unnamed Residents of Wyott's Crossing","Unnamed Residents of Wyott's Crossing","","<p>None of these people are mentioned as individuals in <em>The Town</em>, but Gavin and Charles pay a visit to this community, where the local population was ""having some kind of a squabble over a drainage tax suit"" (181).</p>","Yes"
"23378","3298","Unnamed Chinese Laundryman","Unnamed Chinese Laundryman","","<p>This ""Chinese laundryman"" mentioned in <em>The Town</em> is the only Asian character who appears in Yoknapatawpha.  Charles Mallison explains why, although he is not white, this man is in a category that is distinct from the one that the other non-white - i.e. Negro - inhabitants of Yoknapatawpha belong to: ""And although the Chinese was definitely a colored man even if not a Negro, he was only he, single peculiar and barren; not just kinless but even kindless, half the world or anyway half the continent . . . sundered from his like and therefore as threatless as a mule"" (321).</p>","Yes"
"23377","3297","Unnamed Carpenters","Unnamed Carpenters","","<p>These workers begin remodeling Manfred de Spain's house after Flem purchases it in <em>The Town</em>. They are adding columns consistent with the stereotypical image of the antebellum mansion.</p>","Yes"
"23376","3296","Unnamed Burglars","Unnamed Burglars","","<p>These are the two men who break into and rob Willy Christian's drugstore in <em>The Town</em> and again in <em>The Mansion</em>.</p>","No"
"23375","3295","Unnamed Boys in Jefferson 2","Unnamed Boys in Jefferson 2","","<p>This entry represents the boys who appear or are referred to in various passages in <em>The Town</em>.  For example, Mink Snopes called out from the jail to passing boys ""he could trust would deliver his message"" to Flem Snopes (85). ""All the boys in town"" appreciate Eck Snopes' goodness and the ""raw peanuts"" he is always willing to share with them (116).  ""All the boys in Jefferson between six and twelve years old and sometimes even older"" enjoy stealing watermelons from Ab Snopes' patch, then watching him rage about the loss (138).   Uncle Willy Christian - if approached at the right times - gives the boys on the baseball teams ""balls and bats"" and ""ice cream free whether they won or not"" (163). The ""two boys"" at Uncle Willy's drugstore with ""their heads inside the open safe looking at where the money had been stolen from"" are probably on one of these teams (164).  Since Faulkner often uses the word 'all' to describe a group that is entirely 'white,' we assume there are no non-white boys in any of these groups.</p>","Yes"
"23374","3294","Unnamed Boy Who Rides with Levitt","Unnamed Boy Who Rides with Levitt","","<p>When Linda declines to ride with Matt Levitt in <em>The Town</em>, he is seen driving with ""another boy or man"" in his racer (197).</p>","Yes"
"23373","3293","Unnamed Board of Directors of Sartoris Bank","Unnamed Board of Directors of Sartoris Bank","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> the bank's board of directors meets during the Byron Snopes embezzlement crisis.  In <em>The Mansion</em> they appear more obliquely, when Flem claims he has to confer with the bank director's before taking over the mortage on the Compson property.</p>","Yes"
"23372","3292","Unnamed Board of County Supervisors 1","Unnamed Board of County Supervisors 1","","<p>As County Attorney in <em>The Town</em>, Gavin reports to ""the Board of Supervisors""; these men don't appear in the novel, but he does think of them, facetiously, docking his pay for writing a personal letter on county ""letterhead"" (223).</p>","Yes"
"23371","3291","Unnamed Baptist and Methodist Settlers","Unnamed Baptist and Methodist Settlers","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Charles explains the origins of Yoknapatawpha's white population's basic moral code by referring to the past.  Their ancestors, he says, ""hadn't quitted home and security for a wilderness in which to find freedom of thought as they claimed and oh yes, believed, but to find freedom in which to be incorrigible and unreconstructible Baptists and Methodists; not to escape from tyranny as they claimed and believed, but to establish one"" (321).</p>","Yes"
"23370","3290","Unnamed Bank Stockholders","Unnamed Bank Stockholders","","<p>According to Charles in <em>The Town</em>, the people who own stock in the Sartoris bank include some of the most prestigious families in Yoknapatawpha - besides Sartorises, he mentions Major de Spain, Will Varner, ""the Compsons and Benbows and Peabodys and Miss Eunice Habersham"" as well as the Stevenses - and also ""a hundred others that were farmers around in the county"" (124).</p>","Yes"
"23369","3289","Unnamed Automobile Owners","Unnamed Automobile Owners","","<p>These are the people referred to in <em>The Town</em> as ""somebody with an automobile"" (71), a small but growing group of Yoknapatawpha residents during the period in which the novel is set.  They bail Jabbo out of jail whenever one of them has a car that needs fixing.</p>","Yes"
"23368","3288","Unnamed Customers at the Atelier Monty","Unnamed Customers at the Atelier Monty","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Charles naively - or perhaps coyly - describes the men from ""the next towns"" and elsewhere who visit Montgomery Ward's photographic studio at night this way: ""going and coming through the side door in the alley; and them the kind of men you wouldn't hardly think it had ever occurred to them they might ever need to have their picture struck"" (131).  After the store's pornographic business has been exposed, Snopes boasts that his male clientele includes well-known ""names scattered around in banks and stores and gins and filling stations and farmers too two counties wide in either direction"" (172).  They are mentioned again in <em>The Mansion</em>, which says that these men come from ""as far away as three county seats"" (62).</p>","Yes"
"23366","3286","Unnamed Alderman","Unnamed Alderman","","<p>Jefferson is governed by an elected Board of Aldermen as well as a Mayor.  This unnamed alderman in <em>The Town</em> is the one who responds to Gavin Stevens' request that the town drain the water tank to find the brass Flem has stolen by saying, ""I don’t know how much it will cost to drain that tank, but I for one will be damned - "" before Gavin cuts him off (89).  (See also Unnamed Board of Aldermen in this index.)</p>","Yes"
"23365","3285","Mr. Thorndyke","Thorndyke, Mr.","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Mr. Thorndyke is the Episcopalian pastor who appears at the Mallisons' house with three other (unnamed) pastors - a Methodist, a Baptist, and a Presbyterian - to ask Gavin about the plans for Eula's memorial service.  Gavin accuses them of having been ""sent by a lot of damned old women of both sexes, including none,"" people in the town who are anxious about burying Eula's story as well as her body; Gavin calls them all ""Doctor"" (359).</p>","Yes"
"23364","3284","Unnamed Stonemasons 2","Unnamed Stonemasons 2","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Gavin hires these ""masons"" to attach the medallion of Eula to her tombstone (370).  These artisans should not be confused with the ""Masons"" - the members of the fraternal society who are also mentioned in the novel.</p>","Yes"
"23363","3283","Old Mr. Stone","Stone, Old Mr.","","<p>The ""old"" lawyer Stone (as Eula refers to him in <em>The Town</em>) is likely ""the nice"" Mr. Stone's father (342).</p>","No"
"23362","3282","Mr. Stone|Oxford Lawyer","Stone, Mr.|Oxford Lawyer","Old Mr. Stone","<p>The Oxford, Mississippi, lawyer with whom Linda consults while attending the University of Mississippi is named Stone in <em>The Town</em>.  At her request, he devises a ""contingency"" by which Linda stipulates that Flem Snopes should receive any inheritance she is left by her mother. ""He was very nice,"" Linda says (342).   (He is mentioned but not named in <em>The Mansion</em>.)  The real person behind this character is unquestionably Oxford resident Phil Stone, a lawyer and a descendant of a prominent local family.  Four years older than William Faulkner, Stone served as the young writer's friend, mentor, and advocate, especially at the beginning of his career. Stone and Faulkner first developed 'Snopes stories' to make fun of certain parvenu families in Lafayette County. Faulkner dedicated all three volumes of the Snopes trilogy to that real Stone.</p>","No"
"23361","3281","Doctor Wyott","Wyott, Doctor","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Old Doctor Wyott is president emeritus of the Academy founded by his grandfather; he ""could read not only Greek and Hebrew but Sanskrit too,"" and is ""absolved"" from religious affiliation by conventional Jeffersonians (320).  It would seem likely that he and the Vaiden Wyott who is such a good elementary school teacher must be related.  Like him, she is descended from an old Yoknapatawpha family.  But the novel gives no hint of a relationship between these two Wyott lineages.</p>","Yes"
"23360","3280","Miss Vaiden Wyott","Wyott, Miss Vaiden","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Miss Vaiden Wyott is the second grade teacher who encourages and advises Wallstreet Panic Snopes throughout his public school education and beyond.  She is a descendant of an old Yoknapatawpha family, but after teaching in Jefferson for a decade she decides ""to accept a position in a school in Bristol, Virginia""  (154).   It would seem likely that she and the Doctor Wyott who runs the Academy that his grandfather founded must be related.  Both these descendants of generations in Yoknapatawpha share a common interest in eduction.  But the novel gives no hint of a family connection between them.</p>","Yes"
"23359","3279","Wyott, Grandfather of Doctor Wyott","Wyott, Grandfather of Doctor Wyott","","<p>In <em>The Town</em>, this grandfather of Old Doctor Wyott founded the Jefferson Academy.</p>","Yes"
"23358","3278","Wyotts","Wyotts","","<p>Miss Wyott is a teacher in Jefferson in <em>The Town</em>, but the narrative notes that her ""own people"" - that is, her ancestors - ""had come from the country (her own branch of it remained there where they had owned the nearest ford, crossing, ferry before Jefferson even became Jefferson)"" (154).  (In <em>The Reivers</em> Faulkner re-names the family that owns this spot Wylie.)</p>","Yes"
"23357","3277","Winbush, Mother of Grover Cleveland","Winbush, Mother of Grover Cleveland","","<p>In <em>The Town</em>, the mother of Grover Cleveland Winbush lives out in the county, at Whiteleaf.  Her son sends her ""a dollar's worth of furnish"" (food staples) every Saturday morning (176).</p>","Yes"
"23356","3276","Mr. Wildermark","Wildermark, Mr.","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Mr. Wildermark owns a store on Courthouse Square and orders ""men's shoes which buttoned, with toes like small tulip bulbs, of an archaic and obsolete pattern,"" for Miss Mannie Hait once a year (244).</p>","Yes"
"23355","3275","Mrs. Widrington","Widrington, Mrs.","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Mrs. Widrington owns a ""a Pekinese with a gold name-plate on its collar that probably didn't even know it was a dog""  (380).  When the animal disappears, Mrs. Widrington runs ads ""in all the Memphis and north Mississippi and west Tennessee and east Arkansas papers"" and agitates the local lawmen - Hub Hampton and Buck Connors - to look for it.</p>","Yes"
"23354","3274","Mr. Widrington","Widrington, Mr.","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Mr. Widrington is a newcomer to Jefferson who drives his wife and her pedigree dog around town in a Cadillac.</p>","Yes"
"23353","3273","Grenier Weddel","Weddel, Grenier","","<p>Weddel is pursuing Sally Priest, a married woman, and sends her a corsage. His first name, Grenier, comes from one of the founding Yoknapatawpha families - but <em>The Town</em>, where he appears, says nothing about a genealogical connection to that family.</p>","Yes"
"23352","3272","Whit Rouncewell","Rouncewell, Whit","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Whit Rouncewell first appears when he tries to find the town's night marshal Grover Cleveland Winbush after seeing ""them two fellows in Christian's drug store"" (169). He is probably a relative of Mrs. Rouncewell, perhaps her son; he is definitely a contemporary of Linda Snopes: later in the novel, he is one of Linda's adolescent admirers and escorts during her last year in high school (222).  He appears again in <em>The Mansion</em>, the next and last book in the Snopes trilogy.  There he is referred to by Ratliff only as ""that durn boy that seen them two robbers in Uncle Willy's drug cabinet"" after leaving ""the late picture show"" (61), an event that leads to the discovery of Montgomery Ward Snopes' ""Atelier"" (60). This boy's unnamed ""paw"" is also referred to in this passage, but again no explicit connection with any of the other Rouncewells in the fictions is made.</p>","Yes"
"23351","3271","John Wesley Roebuck","Roebuck, John Wesley","","<p>A friend of Chick Mallison, John Wesley is among the five boys who go rabbit hunting along Harrykin Creek on a winter day.  Many of the males in Yoknapatawpha are named after Confederate generals; John Wesley is undoubtedly named after the 18th century English cleric who was one of the founders of Methodism.</p>","Yes"
"23350","3270","Mrs. Riddell","Riddell, Mrs.","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> this woman is the wife of the highway engineer who moves to Jefferson, where they discover that their second grade son has polio.</p>","Yes"

"23348","3313","Riddell, Boy","Riddell, Boy","Mrs. Riddell, Mr. Riddell","<p>In <em>The Town</em>, this second-grade boy moves to Jefferson with his parents.  When it is discovered that he has polio, the school that he and Chick attend is closed.  He is hospitalized in Memphis, and Eula says to Chick, ""Let's hope they got him to Memphis in time"" (324).</p>","Yes"
"23346","3267","Nelly Ratcliffe","Ratcliffe, Nelly","","<p>She is the wife of the original Vladimir Kyrilytch and mother of the second.  She is the daughter of a Virginia farmer who hid and fed the Russian-born mercenary soldier when he escaped from an American prison during the Revolutionary War.  At some point they married, and began the line of ""V.K.""s  that culminates in the character readers meet frequently in the fictions.  As her story is told in <em>The Town</em>and repeated in <em>The Mansion</em>, her maiden name was Ratcliffe, and the couple adopted it as their married name. Over time, the ""c"" and ""e"" were dropped from the spelling.</p>","No"
"23344","3265","Sally Hampton Priest","Priest, Sally Hampton","","<p>Sally Priest, an abused married woman, receives a corsage from Grenier Weddel and a black eye from her husband; according to Gowan Stevens' account, ""you would even have thought she was proud of it"" (81).    Her maiden name, ""Sally Hampton"" (80), suggests she is related to the Hamptons who are county sheriffs in other fictions, but if Faulkner imagined her in that relation, the text gives no hint of it.  (When <em>The Town</em> was reprinted in 1964, the names of the two Priests were changed to ""Parsons,"" perhaps to avoid confusion with the many members of the very different Priest family who appear in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> [1962] - though Faulkner did not usually worry about creating such kinds of confusion.)</p>","Yes"
"23343","3264","Maurice Priest","Priest, Maurice","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Sally Priest's husband, Maurice, fights with Grenier Weddel and blacks one of his eyes for sending his wife ""not just what Father called a standard panic-size corsage, but a triple one"" (81). Then, at home, Maurice Priest blackens his wife's eye.  (The Maury Priest who appears in <em>The Reivers</em> is apparently a different character.)</p>","Yes"
"23342","3263","Mrs. Nunnery","Nunnery, Mrs.","","<p>Mrs. Nunnery is the mother in <em>The Town</em> who enlists Eck Snopes' help when her son Cedric goes missing.  She is so frantic that she doesn't even hear the explosion in which Eck blows himself up during the search; ""finally they made her sit down and somebody gave her a drink of whiskey and she quit screaming"" (115).</p>","Yes"
"23341","3262","Cedric Nunnery","Nunnery, Cedric","Mrs. Nunnery","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Cedric is the son of Mrs. Nunnery and about five years old.   After he goes off to play in a culvert, the search for him results in Eck Snopes' accidental death.  Cedric himself returns unscathed.</p>","Yes"

"23339","3260","Matt Levitt","Levitt, Matt","","<p>Matt Levitt won the Golden Gloves boxing competition ""up in Ohio or somewhere last year,"" according to Charles Mallison in <em>The Town</em> (192). Gavin says, ""He graduated from that new Ford mechanic's school and the company sent him here to be a mechanic in the agency garage"" (192). Levitt owns a yellow cut-down racer, and Linda rides in it with him. He and Gavin, for a time, are rivals for Linda's attention.  After Matt bloodies Gavin's face and has a violent altercation with Anse McCallum, the sheriff runs him out of Jefferson.</p>","Yes"
"23338","3259","Mrs. Ledbetter","Ledbetter, Mrs.","","<p>Mrs. Ledbetter - whom Ratliff invariably calls ""Miz"" Ledbetter - lives near Frenchman's Bend in a place called Rockyford.  In <em>The Town</em> she buys a sewing machine.  In both that novel and <em>The Mansion</em> Ratliff travels to Rockyford to deliver it.</p>","Yes"
"23337","3258","Mr. Kneeland","Kneeland, Mr.","","<p>In <em>The Town</em>, Mr. Kneeland owns the tailor shop in Jefferson, where he makes men's clothes and rents out formal menswear, such as the tuxedos worn to the Cotillion Club ball.</p>","Yes"
"23336","3257","Mr. Hovis","Hovis, Mr.","","<p>In  <em>The Town</em>, Mr. Hovis is the Sartoris bank cashier who receives a ""coca cola"" at the bank's closing time (323).   (If in Faulkner's imagination he's related to the Mrs. Hovis who appears in the earlier short story ""Uncle Willy,"" the novel doesn't mention the connection.)</p>","Yes"
"23335","3256","Ashley Holcomb","Holcomb, Ashley","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Ashley Holcomb is one the boys in the Harrykin Creek hunting party.</p>","Yes"
"23334","3255","Hogganbeck, Grandfather of Melissa","Hogganbeck, Grandfather of Melissa","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> the grandfather of Melissa Hogganbeck served under Lee during the Civil War till the end, through the surrender at Appomattox in 1865.</p>","Yes"
"23333","3254","W.C. Handy","Handy, W.C.","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> W.C. Handy, the famous Negro band leader and composer ""from Beale Street in Memphis,"" provides the music for the Cotillion Ball (76).  In the larger canon, Handy also provided Faulkner with the title of the short story ""That Evening Sun"" (1931) - one of Handy's most famous songs is ""St. Louis Blues"" (1914), which begins ""I hate to see that evening sun go down.""  The novel calls him ""Professor Handy"" (76); Handy called himself, and has often been called by others, 'the Father of the Blues.'</p>","Yes"
"23332","3253","Emily Habersham","Habersham, Emily","","<p>In the Vintage International edition of <em>The Town</em> that we use as our source text, ""Miss Emily Habersham"" arranges for Bryon Snopes' children to travel ""back home, to Byron Snopes or the reservation or wherever it was"" (389).  She may be some kind of social worker, but that is not clearly suggested.  It has to be acknowledged that she probably exists as a 'character' only because in 1999 Noel Polk derived his 'Corrected Text' of <em>The Town</em> from the ribbon typescript in the Faulkner Foundation Collection at the University of Virginia. In the fall of 1956, when Saxe Commins, Faulkner's editor at Random House, read the page proofs of the novel (also in the UVA Library), he suspected that Miss Habersham's first name was a mistake on Faulkner's part: on the page where she appears he queried the author, ""Isn't this Miss <em>Eunice</em>, the direct-action lady of  <em>Intruder</em>?  Also mentioned on p. 71 of <em>Town</em>.""  (Eunice's name appears on pages 74 and 124 of the Vintage text.)  In response, Faulkner circled ""Eunice"" and wrote ""Yes.""  Accordingly, in all the editions Random House published prior to Polk's, it is Eunice Habersham who helps get those children ""back home"" - and there is no character named Emily Habersham.  (To complicate things still further: in our index, Eunice Habersham appears in the entry for Belle Worsham|Eunice Habersham - where we explain why we decided to treat these women as <em>one</em> character.)</p>","Yes"
"23331","3252","Jabbo Gatewood","Gatewood, Jabbo","Uncle Noon Gatewood","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Jabbo Gatewood is the son of Uncle Noon Gatewood, who as a blacksmith shod horses.  In a sign of social change, Jabbo becomes an automobile mechanic:  ""Jabbo was the best mechanic in the county and although he still got drunk and into jail as much as ever, he never stayed longer than just overnight anymore because somebody with an automobile always needed him to pay his fine by morning"" (71).</p>","Yes"
"23330","3251","Uncle Noon Gatewood","Gatewood, Uncle Noon","","<p>Although the soubriquet applied to Uncle Noon Gatewood in <em>The Town</em> labels him according to the demeaning conventions of Jim Crow culture, he is one of the few Negro businessmen who appear in the fictions.

Gavin Stevens describes him physically as ""an old man with an old man's dim cloudy eyes magnified and enormous behind the thick lenses of his iron-framed spectacles"" (328).  Gavin describes him morally in a more complex way: Garraway never ""wittingly or unwittingly harmed anyone black or white, not serious harm: not more than adding a few extra cents to what it would have been for cash, when the article went on credit; or  selling to a Negro for half-price or often less (oh yes, at times even giving it to him) the tainted meat or rancid lard or weevilled flour or meal he would not have permitted a white man - a Protestant gentile white man of course - to eat at all out of his store"" (330).</p>","Yes"

"23314","3236","Eve Adams","Adams, Eve","","<p>The mother of Theron Adams in <em>The Town</em> is the ""old fat wife"" of Mayor Adams (11).

"23313","3235","Unnamed Twin Nephews of Devries","Unnamed Twin Nephews of Devries","","<p>When Ratliff calls Devries two nephews ""them foreign twin boys"" in ""By the People,"" he means they are not from Yoknapatawpha (138).  In that story and again in <em>The Mansion</em>, they are apparently old enough to understand ""what might happen"" if Clarence Snopes' legs are anointed by ""damp switches"" from the dog thicket, and to know how to do so without getting caught (138, 349).</p>","Yes"
"23312","3234","Unnamed Sister of Devries","Unnamed Sister of Devries","","<p>The sister of Devries in ""By the People"" and <em>The Mansion</em> is, like her brother, not from Yoknapatawpha but a county further east; she comes to the picnic at Varner's Mill to watch her brother announce his candidacy, bringing her twin sons with her.</p>","Yes"
"23311","3233","Unnamed Negroes in Frenchman's Bend","Unnamed Negroes in Frenchman's Bend","","<p>Although in other Yoknapatawpha fictions the population of Frenchman's Bend is almost entirely white, local Negroes appear in ""By the People"" and again in <em>The Mansion</em> in two ways.  The ""roistering gang"" that Clarence Snopes leads frequently ""beats Negroes"" (89, 328).  When Clarence becomes the Bend's constable, he also hits the ""first few Negroes who ran afoul of his new official capacity . . . with the blackjack he carried or the butt of the pistol which he now officially wore"" (89, 329).</p>","Yes"
"23310","3232","Unnamed Negro Troops","Unnamed Negro Troops","","<p>These are the two different groups of ""Negro troops"" who serve in the U.S. Army in World War II and Korea that Devries commands in ""By the People"" (134).  When Faulkner has the story's narrator say that in Korea, Devries ""commands troops containing Negroes"" rather than ""Negro troops,"" as in the earlier war (134), he may be acknowledging the actual, slow history of racial integration in the military.  World War II was the first time the U.S. Army allowed blacks to serve in combat, but kept them in segregated units that were commanded, as the narrator notes, by white officers.  Unofficially blacks were integrated into white units as replacements during the Battle of the Bulge, but it wasn't until after the war that President Truman officially de-segregated the Army, and not until Korea that black soldiers officially fought alongside whites - and then again only after the need for replacements became acute.  <em>The Mansion</em> represents these Negro soldiers the same way, except that there the scenes that took place in Korea in the short story are chronologically shifted back to World War II (338-340).  In the novel, Faulkner's narrator says Devries ""commanded Negro infantry in battle"" before the end of 1943, although historically it wasn't until 1944 that the Army committed black troops to combat - at which time they served with distinction.</p>","No"
"23309","3231","Unnamed Negro Sergeant","Unnamed Negro Sergeant","","<p>In ""By the People"" this Sergeant is serving in the Korean War when ""single-handedly"" he and Devries hold off an enemy attack to allow the escape of a trapped battalion (134).  He is wounded during the action.  This Sergeant appears again when <em>The Mansion</em> describes the same event, with one difference - in the novel the man's heroics occur during World War II (339).</p>","No"
"23308","3230","Unnamed Negro Army Soldier 2","Unnamed Negro Army Soldier 2","","<p>In ""By the People"" and again in <em>The Mansion</em> this soldier, ""a hulking giant of an Arkansas Negro cotton-field hand"" in civilian life (134, 339), heroically rescues Devries and a sergeant by carrying them both away from enemy fire.  Devries (unofficially) recognizes his heroism by pinning one of his own medals on the man.   We can hear affection and admiration in Devries' voice when he addresses the man who saved him as ""you big bastard""; the narrator's tone when he persists in calling this soldier a ""field hand"" is harder to interpret (134, 340).  (The only significant difference between the two texts' accounts of this action is that it happens during the Korean War in the story, and somewhere during World War II in the novel.)</p>","Yes"
"23307","3229","Unnamed Negro Army Soldier 1","Unnamed Negro Army Soldier 1","","<p>In ""By the People"" and again in <em>The Mansion</em> this soldier accompanies Devries to the front line and helps lead the trapped battalion back to safety.  He is called a ""runner"" (134, 339) which probably means he is a soldier assigned to a commanding officer, though it may also mean messenger.  The only difference between the two texts is that in the story this happens in Korea, while in the novel it's somewhere during the fighting in World War II.</p>","No"
"23306","3228","Unnamed Members of Silver Shirts","Unnamed Members of Silver Shirts","","<p>Like the Ku Klux Klan, the next organization that Clarence Snopes joins in ""By the People"" and <em>The Mansion</em> - ""Silver Shirts"" - was a real white supremacist, antisemitic organization (131, 334).  Its official name was the Silver Legion of America, but its nickname acknowledges its ideological indebtedness to Brown Shirts in Germany, the fascist group that helped bring Hitler and the Nazis to power in the 1930s.  It was founded in North Carolina in early 1933.  Clarence Snopes is ""one of the first in Mississippi to join it"" (131, 334), believing that it will outlast ""the old Klan which he had wrecked"" (132, 334).  It did grow during the 1930s, and its founder ran for President of the U.S. as a third-party candidate in 1936, but the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941 quickly resulted in its demise.</p>","Yes"
"23305","3227","Unnamed Members of Ku Klux Klan 2","Unnamed Members of Ku Klux Klan 2","","<p>In ""By the People"" and again in <em>The Mansion</em> Clarence Snopes uses Yoknapatawpha's Ku Klux Klan to advance his own political career, which serves as the occasion for Faulkner's one explicit engagement with the Klan as an element in U.S. history.  Historically the Klan is a terrorist, white supremacist organization that came into existence in the South after the surrender at Appomattox and the abolition of slavery.  Over the succeeding decades it grew stronger and weaker, spread to other parts of the U.S.,  and identified ""Catholics and Jews"" (131, 333) as targets in addition to the African Americans it originally sought to subjugate. In historical fact, Mississippi has been one of its strongholds, though these two texts are the only places where Faulkner mentions it by name. (In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> an unnamed group that is clearly meant to suggest the Klan appears in Yoknapatawpha in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War.) Both the story and the novel keep their distance from the organization, referring to the position of Klan leadership that Clarence Snopes holds as ""its Kleagle, Dragon, whatever the title was"" (131, 331); both texts say that ""in our country"" (that is, presumably, Yoknapatawpha) the KKK ""never got very far and didn't last very long"" (130. 330).  The basis of Snopes' appeal to the more ""liberal"" voters in Jefferson is his professed determination to ""destroy the Ku Klux Klan in our county"" (131, 332). And in the texts he ""did indeed destroy the Ku Klux Klan in Yoknapatawpha"" at that time (333).  When Linda Snopes Kohl campaigns to improve conditions for local blacks in the early 1940s, however, ""a crude cross soaked in gasoline"" is burned in front of the house where she lives; the ""organization which put it there"" is not explicitly identified, but cross-burning was a Klan signature (252).    (See also the entry for Unnamed Night Riders in this index.)</p>","Yes"
"23304","3226","Unnamed Members of Clarence Snopes' Gang","Unnamed Members of Clarence Snopes' Gang","","<p>In ""By the People"" and again in <em>The Mansion</em>, during his youth in Frenchman's Bend Clarence Snopes is the leader of a ""gang of cousins and toadies"" (89, 328) who terrorize the community around Frenchman's Bend.  They fought and drank and beat Negroes and terrified young girls"" (89) - slightly revised to ""fought and drank and gambled and beat up Negroes and terrified women and young girls"" in the novel (328).  In a later paragraph the narrator suggests they beat blacks because, unconsciously, they were afraid of blacks ""as a race"" (89) - or as the novel revises it ""of that alien race"" (329).</p>","Yes"
"23303","3225","Unnamed ""Feller"" Who Tricks Clarence Snopes","Unnamed ""Feller"" Who Tricks Clarence Snopes","","<p>When Ratliff tells the story of how Clarence Snopes' political campaign ended ingloriously in ""By the People"" and again in <em>The Mansion</em>, he invents this man who plays the dirty trick on Snopes to hide himself behind.  In the story he calls this ""feller"" a ""low-minded rascal,"" an ""underhanded son of a gun"" and a ""low-minded scoundrel"" (138).  In the novel he refers to him as an ""anonymous underhanded son-of-a-gun"" and an ""underhanded feller"" (349).  In neither text, however, does Ratliff fool his listeners - or, almost certainly, any of Faulkner's readers.</p>","Yes"
"23302","3224","Unnamed Girls of Frenchman's Bend","Unnamed Girls of Frenchman's Bend","","<p>In ""By the People"" and again in <em>The Mansion</em> these are the ""young girls"" who are ""terrified"" by the gang that Clarence Snopes leads (89, 328).</p>","Yes"
"23301","3222","Unnamed Helper of Clarence Snopes","Unnamed Helper of Clarence Snopes","","<p>This entry represents the ""somebody"" who gets a car in both ""By the People"" and <em>The Mansion</em> and then (as ""they"" in the short story and as ""somebody"" in the novel) drives Clarence Snopes home to get a dry pair of pants.</p>","Yes"
"23298","3221","Unnamed Army Officer 1","Unnamed Army Officer 1","","<p>This army officer - referred to as the ""exec"" in Devries' unit in Korea in ""By the People"" (134) and as the ""second"" in Devries' unit on a World War II battlefield in <em>The Mansion</em> (339) - is the executive officer who is second in command of the Negro combat unit that Devries commands.  It's likely Faulkner imagined him as 'white': historically, as an officer, he would definitely have been white during World War II, and probably white in the Korean War.</p>","No"
"23297","3220","Unnamed Army Nurse 1","Unnamed Army Nurse 1","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> this army nurse, ""kin"" to a Jefferson family, comes to Jefferson after the end of World War I as the town's ""first female hero,"" having served as a lieutenant on a base hospital in France ""within sound of the guns behind Montdidier"" (199).</p>","No"
"23296","3219","Unnamed Army Nurse 2","Unnamed Army Nurse 2","","<p>In ""By the People"" she serves in a field hospital in Korea, and helps Devries reward the soldier who saved him on the battlefield.

"23295","3218","Unnamed Army General","Unnamed Army General","","<p>In ""By the People"" and again in <em>The Mansion</em> this officer pins a medal on Devries; in the story it's for his heroism during the Korean War; in the novel, during World War II.</p>","No"
"23294","3217","Boys Named Remish","Boys Named Remish","","<p>According to the narrator of ""By the People,"" the compact organs manufactured by ""the Remish Musical Company of South Bend, Indiana,"" were so popular with the country folk in Frenchman's Bend that in time ""boy children from that section were bearing into puberty and even manhood Remish as their Christian names"" (87).  The narrator of this story is not noticeably facetious, and Faulkner's country people in other stories name their children things like ""Montgomery Ward,"" so there's no reason to think this is just a joke.</p>","Yes"
"23293","3216","Unnamed Wife of Mister Ernest","Unnamed Wife of Mister Ernest","","<p>Mister Ernest's wife died of unspecified causes three years prior to the time of the narrative in ""Race at Morning"" - that is, a year prior to Mister Ernest adopting the narrator.</p>","No"
"23292","3215","Unnamed Man from Vicksburg Roadhouse","Unnamed Man from Vicksburg Roadhouse","","<p>The narrator of ""Race at Morning"" calls the man with whom his mother ran off ""two years ago"" a ""Vicksburg roadhouse feller"" (307).  ""Roadhouse"" is a dialect term for an inn or tavern on the side of a road.  This man may have worked there, or perhaps the phrase just means the roadhouse is where he and ""maw"" met (307).</p>","No"
"23291","3214","Unnamed Hands and Tenants at Van Dorn","Unnamed Hands and Tenants at Van Dorn","","<p>In ""Race at Morning"" there are both ""hands and tenants"" on Mister Ernest's property (308).  The narrator does not define the difference, but presumably the ""hands"" work for a salary, and the ""tenants"" farm a parcel of land for a share of the crop after it is harvested.  The narrator's parents were among the ""tenants""; no other members of either group are described, but it's likely that there are blacks as well as whites among them.</p>","No"
"23290","3213","Unnamed Game Wardens","Unnamed Game Wardens","","<p>These generic game wardens - the state officers who supervise the start and ending of the deer hunting season in Mississippi - are noted briefly, only once, by the unnamed narrator of ""Race at Morning.""</p>","No"
"23289","3212","Unnamed Mother of Narrator 2","Unnamed Mother of Narrator 2","","<p>The unnamed twelve-year-old narrator of ""Race at Morning"" calls his mother ""maw"" (307).  She abandons him and his father two years before the story takes place, when she ""took off in the middle of the night with a durn Vicksburg roadhouse jake without even waiting to cook breakfast"" for her son (308).</p>","No"
"23288","3211","Unnamed Father of Narrator 3","Unnamed Father of Narrator 3","","<p>The unnamed twelve-year-old narrator of ""Race at Morning"" calls his father ""pap"" (307).  He leaves his son behind when he leaves the tenant cabin he lives on at Mister Ernest's place, presumably to search for his wife, who has herself run off with a ""durn Vicksburg roadhouse jake"" (308). He never returns for his son.</p>","No"
"23287","3210","Simon","Simon","","<p>The Simon who appears in ""Race at Morning"" is not Simon Strother, who appears in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and <em>The Unvanquished</em>.  Like that earlier 'Simon,' however, he is a servant, one of black cooks for the white deer hunters. He also handles the hunting dogs while the white hunters pursue deer.</p>","Yes"
"23286","3209","Mister Ernest","Ernest, Mister","","<p>According to the twelve-year-old narrator of ""Race at Morning"" Mister Ernest ""wasn't jest a planter; he was a farmer"" too - which means he worked on his land along with ""his hands and tenants"" (308).  He raises ""cotton and oats and beans and hay"" (309) at Van Dorn, his estate somewhere close to the wilderness in which the hunt takes place. A widower, he adopts the unnamed narrator when the child's parents - tenant farmers on his land - abandon him. Mister Ernest goes deer hunting each November with a party of men from Yoknapatawpha.  Although he also hunts from horseback, Mister Ernest is likely somewhat below the social stature of Roth Edmonds. Mister Ernest and the narrator always stay an extra day at the hunting camp after the other men leave to partake of the food and whiskey the other hunters leave at the camp. Mister Ernest's plan that his adopted son will start school rather than participate in the next November hunt indicates his understanding of historical forces and social changes that make a formal education more necessary than in the past.</p>","No"
"23284","3207","Unnamed Young Southern Woman","Unnamed Young Southern Woman","","<p><em>Requiem for a Nun</em> establishes the social status of Jefferson's ""Female Academy"" by referring to the value that a ""certificate"" from it has for ""a young woman of North Mississippi or West Tennessee"" (177).</p>","Yes"
"23283","3206","Unnamed Young Northern Woman","Unnamed Young Northern Woman","","<p><em>Requiem for a Nun</em>'s narrator creates this 'character' as a point of reference. As part of his description of Jefferson's ""Female Academy,"" he mentions a hypothetical ""young female from Long Island or Philadelphia"" who receives an invitation ""signed by Queen Victoria"" (177).</p>","No"
"23282","3205","Unnamed Women of Jackson","Unnamed Women of Jackson","","<p>The ""Jackson women"" who in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> sponsor the three-day ""Kermis Ball"" to raise money for a Confederate monument in 1887 may belong to an early version of a group like the United Daughters of the Confederacy (87).  The term ""kermis"" refers to an outdoor festival.</p>","No"
"23281","3204","Unnamed Wife of Cashier","Unnamed Wife of Cashier","","<p>The ""childless wife"" of the bank cashier who beats Nancy is only mentioned in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.</p>","Yes"
"23280","3203","Unnamed Visitors","Unnamed Visitors","","<p>In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, these people are the ""kin or friends or acquaintances"" of the ""outlanders"" who move to Jefferson after World War II; they are described as visiting ""from the East or North or California"" on their way ""to New Orleans or Florida"" (196).</p>","Yes"
"23279","3202","Unnamed U.D.C. Ladies","Unnamed U.D.C. Ladies","","<p>""The U.D.C. ladies"" who ""instigated and bought"" the Confederate statue that stands at the center of Jefferson in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> are members of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, an organization of Southern women that was founded in 1894 in Nashville, Tennessee (188).  Members actively served the 'Lost Cause' of the Old South and the Confederacy by sponsoring the construction of monuments, lobbying boards of education, and so on.  In a later reference to these women, noting their passing by the middle of the 20th century, the narrator refers to them as the ""old sapless indomitable unvanquished widow or maiden aunt"" - though he adds that ""the old deathless Lost Cause"" remains a ""faded (though still select) social club or caste"" (194).</p>","Yes"
"23278","3201","Unnamed Trial Spectators 2","Unnamed Trial Spectators 2","","<p>These are ""the invisible spectators"" in the courtroom who ""gasp"" at Nancy's response upon being given the death sentence at the start of Act I in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> (41).  The play's second scene makes it clear that Temple and Gowan Stevens are among those present, but from the text's only description of the spectators - they are ""invisible"" - we cannot say that for sure.  The spectators' reaction seems to be a collective one, though it's likely that unlike the white men who participate in the trial as lawyers, officers and jury members, this audience includes non-white and non-male people.</p>","Yes"
"23277","3200","Unnamed Three Frenchmen","Unnamed Three Frenchmen","","<p>One of the ""three Frenchmen"" mentioned in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> traveling down the Mississippi River in ""a Chippeway canoe"" is almost certainly René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, the 17th-century French explorer credited with discovering the river and claiming it and all the territory it drained for France (81).  But it's not clear why Faulkner associates him specifically with two other Frenchmen.  The actual party of Frenchmen and French-Canadians who, along with a group of Canadian Indians, traveled downriver to the Gulf of Mexico in 1682-1683 was much larger.</p>","No"
"23276","3199","Unnamed Steamboat Captain","Unnamed Steamboat Captain","","<p>The history of Jackson in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> includes a mention of ""the captain"" of a riverboat who puts a ""gambler"" off his ship (83).

"23275","3198","Unnamed Spanish-American War Soldiers","Unnamed Spanish-American War Soldiers","","<p>Describing the unveiling of Jefferson's Confederate monument in 1900, <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> notes that ""sons"" of the ""old men in gray"" who attend the ceremony ""had already died in blue coats in Cuba"" - i.e. were young men from Yoknapatawpha who died serving in the U.S. Army during the Spanish-American War (189).</p>","Yes"

"23271","3194","Unnamed Slaves in Jackson","Unnamed Slaves in Jackson","","<p><em>Requiem for a Nun</em> mentions the ""Negro slaves"" who belonged to the men who settled the territory around what became Jackson (82), but as is also the case with most of the ""slaves"" in Yoknapatawpha it mentions, these enslaved people are not described in any way.</p>","No"
"23270","3193","Unnamed Slave Owners","Unnamed Slave Owners","","<p>According to the history of Jackson in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, the ""Anglo-Saxon pioneer"" (81) was followed by wealthier settlers who built the ""river towns"" like Vicksburg and Natchez, ""men with mouths full of law, in broadcloth and flowered waistcoats, who owned Negro slaves and Empire beds"" (82).

""Them"" refers to the various men she has had sex with, as both a woman and a prostitute.</p>","Yes"
"23267","3190","Unnamed Early Settlers","Unnamed Early Settlers","","<p>At various points in its prose history of Yoknapatawpha and Jefferson, <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> refers to the settlers who followed the frontier pioneers into the new land.  There is some overlap in its representation of this group, and in the terms - frontier, pioneer - used to categorize them.  For example, the earliest reference to the group who settle in the place that becomes Jefferson and begin clearing the land, says ""now it was frontier, the men and women pioneers, tough, simple, and durable, seeking money or adventure or freedom or simple escape, and not too particular how they did it"" (4).  A later reference refers to ""the husbandman"" (171).  These settlers occupy an intermediate stage, between ""the forest men with rifles"" and ""the land speculators and the traders in slaves"" (171).</p>","Yes"
"23266","3189","Unnamed Salesgirls in Memphis","Unnamed Salesgirls in Memphis","","<p>In her account of her confinement in Memphis in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, Temple mentions that the perfume and clothes Popeye bought for her were selected by ""salesgirls"" (112).</p>","No"
"23265","3188","Unnamed Riverboat Gambler","Unnamed Riverboat Gambler","","<p>According to the history of Jackson recounted in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, as the territory became more settled, the ""steamboat gambler"" replaced the keelboatman as ""the river hero"" (83).  Since the gambler is only seen being put off the steamboat and ""marooned"" on a small island, the term ""hero"" is presumably freighted with irony (83).</p>","No"
"23264","3187","Unnamed Returning Confederates","Unnamed Returning Confederates","","<p>The group of Confederate veterans who are in Yoknapatawpha after they finish active service includes the soldiers who were wounded in ""the battle of Jefferson"" (183), the men who were cut off from other Confederate forces during the last year of the Civil War, and ""the men of '65,"" the men who fought until the surrender at Appomattox ended the war and left them to ""find themselves alien"" in the land they had been fighting for after they make their way back to it (184).</p>","Yes"
"23263","3186","Unnamed Reader","Unnamed Reader","","<p>Near the end of the third prose section of <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, the narrator looks up from the story he is telling to address the reader directly as ""you"" (198).  He identifies the reader as ""a stranger, an outlander say from the East or the North or the Far West"" (198), and speculates that ""you"" may be college educated, or ""perhaps even"" have an graduate degree from ""Harvard or Northwestern or Stanford"" (205).  This second person plays a significant if rhetorical role in the way the history of Yoknapatawpha is ultimately evoked.</p>","No"
"23262","3185","Unnamed Performers on Radio","Unnamed Performers on Radio","","<p>The representation of modernity in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> includes ""the boom and ululance of radio,"" represented by the voices that are heard on it: ""the patter of comedians, the baritone screams of female vocalists"" (192).</p>","No"
"23261","3184","Unnamed Negro Preacher 2","Unnamed Negro Preacher 2","","<p>Tubbs, the jailor, tells Nancy that he has ""found that preacher"" she requested (221).

"23260","3183","Unnamed Modern Planter","Unnamed Modern Planter","","<p>In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> this 20th-century ""planter"" is a generic figure whose fate suggests the kinds of changes that have occurred in Yoknapatawpha: where once he had slaves and then tenants to work his fields, after his ""son"" is drafted in the second World War it is the planter himself who does that, riding ""on the seat of his tractor"" (193).</p>","Yes"
"23259","3182","Unnamed Participants in Nancy's Trial","Unnamed Participants in Nancy's Trial","","<p>In the play's first scene in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, ""a section of the court"" is represented on stage, and the stage directions list ""the judge, officers, the opposing lawyers, the jury"" (39).  The ""judge"" and one of the officers - the bailiff - speak in the scene, and so have their own Character entries.  This entry represents the other men referred to, though it's unlikely that any production of the play would cast actors to represent the ""opposing lawyers"" or ""the jury"" on stage.</p>","Yes"
"23258","3181","Unnamed New Settlers","Unnamed New Settlers","","<p>According to the history of Jefferson provided by <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, soon after the first whites arrive in Yoknapatawpha come these ""new"" settlers: ""new names and faces too in the settlement now - faces so new as to have (to the older residents) no discernible antecedents other than mammalinity nor past other than the simple years which had scored them"" (12).</p>","Yes"
"23257","3180","Unnamed Negro Who Kicks Nancy","Unnamed Negro Who Kicks Nancy","","<p>All we know about referred to in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> as ""the man who kicked"" Nancy and caused her miscarriage is that he might have been the unborn child's father (219). Because the assault happened at ""a picnic or dance or frolic or fight"" and Nancy would not have been allowed to attend a gathering of whites, we are assuming this man is black (219).</p>","Yes"
"23256","3179","Unnamed Negro Residents of Jefferson","Unnamed Negro Residents of Jefferson","","<p>There are only a few references in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> to the black population of Jefferson. The narrative qualifies its representation of progress (""there were electric lights and running water in almost every house in town"") by noting an exception - ""except the cabins of Negroes"" (189). It is also clearly implied in a later passage that those cabins lacked screens to keep the bugs out (190).</p>","Yes"
"23255","3178","Unnamed Negro Leaders","Unnamed Negro Leaders","","<p>According to the narrator of <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, ""Negro leaders developed by"" the several Negro colleges that were established in Jackson after Emancipation ""intervened"" in some way when Federal troops drove Governor Humphreys out of office ""in 1868"" (87).  Negro colleges were a major source of leaders for the African American community during the 19th century; however,  the event described by the narrator is historically impossible, since none of the Negro colleges he mentions - Tougaloo, Jackson and Campbell - were in existence before 1869, as the dates provided in the novel itself make clear.</p>","No"
"23254","3177","Unnamed Negro Iceman","Unnamed Negro Iceman","","<p>Although <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> refers to him as ""the Negro driver,"" the man who delivers ice around Jefferson in a wagon is probably more accurately described as an iceman.

"23253","3176","Unnamed Aboriginals 2","Unnamed Aboriginals 2","","<p>The narrator of <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> begins his history of the city of Jackson in the distant past, which includes the ""nameless though recorded predecessors [of the Choctaw and Chickasaw peoples] who built the mounds"" (81).  Conventionally referred to by historians and anthropologists as 'the mound builders,' these prehistoric peoples may have inhabited the continent for upwards of five thousand years.  Many of their mounds still remain on the landscape of Mississippi.  Their actual purpose or purposes are not thoroughly understood, but in several of his stories Faulkner uses them to evoke a mythic past along with a sense of dread or wonder.</p>","No"
"23252","3175","Unnamed Mohammedan Prince","Unnamed Mohammedan Prince","","<p>One of the more exotic characters in the Yoknapatawpha fictions, this ""Mohammedan"" prince has a ""European mistress"" in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>; he never appears in the novel, but is mentioned as the man who built the ""hideway"" in the south of France where Temple Drake and Gowan Stevens take their honeymoon (122).</p>","No"
"23251","3174","Unnamed Mississippi Legislators 1","Unnamed Mississippi Legislators 1","","<p>According to the account of the development of Mississippi from wilderness to civilization in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, ""the politicians"" follow the ""land speculators"" (172).  The novel's history of the place that became Jackson more specifically notes the role the legislature played in creating a new state capital after the Mississippi territory achieved statehood in 1817, though it also notes, wryly, how at various later moments ""the Senate"" and ""the House"" alternately sought to change the location (85-86).</p>","No"
"23250","3173","Unnamed Mississippi Indians 2","Unnamed Mississippi Indians 2","","<p><em>Requiem for a Nun</em> lists five Indian tribes as the groups who ""dispossessed"" the aboriginal mound builders in Mississippi: the Algonquian, the Chickasaw, the Choctaw, the Natchez and the Pascagoula (81). The Algonquian language group was large and widespread, but found almost entirely in Canada and nowhere near Mississippi, so their presence on the list is surprising. The Chickasaw were the people who lived in and closest to the part of Mississippi where Faulkner locates Yoknapatawpha: they often appear in his fiction (sometimes interchangeably with the Choctaw) and have their own entry in the database of this novel's characters. The Natchez lived in the southwestern part of the state, while the Pascagoula lived along the river of the same name, especially near the point where it flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The Yazoo and the Biloxi were other tribes who could have been on the narrator's list.</p>","Yes"
"23249","3172","Unnamed Militia Band","Unnamed Militia Band","","<p>In ""A Name for the City"" and again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> these militia men are ""part of a general muster at the settlement . . . for a Fourth of July barbeque"" (201, 5). Like stereotypical frontiersmen, they are soon ""ejected"" from town for their ""drunken brawling"" (201, 5-6). After running into and capturing a gang of bandits, they return to the settlement in hopes of claiming a reward; instead, they are eventually locked up with the outlaws they had captured.</p>","Yes"
"23248","3171","Unnamed Stonemasons 1","Unnamed Stonemasons 1","","<p>In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> the ""masons who erect"" the Confederate statue in Courthouse Square are mentioned, but not described (189).

"23245","3168","Unnamed Interned Japanese Americans","Unnamed Interned Japanese Americans","","<p>As noted in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, during World War II the U.S. government interned over 100,000 people of Japanese ancestry (two-thirds of them US citizens) as ""enemy aliens"" (194).  Most of these people had been living on the west coast, and all the interment camps they were taken to were west of the Mississippi.</p>","No"
"23244","3167","Unnamed Inhabitants of Jefferson","Unnamed Inhabitants of Jefferson","","<p>In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> over twelve ""successive overlapping generations"" of ""men and women and children"" (159) live in Jefferson between the time it was a settlement and the present of the novel (i.e. c1950).  One passage specifically divides the town's population along racial lines: the advent of ""screens in windows"" means that ""people (white people) could actually sleep in summer night air"" (190).  Elsewhere the descriptions of the town's population implicitly privilege or assume the white population: for example, the evoked details of the members of those twelve generations - ""a gleam of crinoline, a laced wrist, perhaps even a Cavalier plume"" - identifies this group as white (169).  During the Civil War Jefferson becomes ""a town of old men and women and children and an occasional wounded soldier"" (181), a description that again omits the non-white part of the population.</p>","Yes"
"23243","3166","Unnamed Wild Indians and Whites","Unnamed Wild Indians and Whites","","<p>The Mississippi wilderness in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> is occupied by potentially dangerous ""wild Indians and wilder white men"" (7). Both groups apparently live outside the region's tribal and settlement communities. The wildness of such outlaws is reflected in their treatment of inexperienced travelers: ""[F]or no more than the boots on his feet, men would murder a traveler and gut him like a bear or deer or fish and fill the cavity with rocks and sink the evidence in the nearest water"" (10).</p>","Yes"
"23242","3165","Unnamed Hotel Residents","Unnamed Hotel Residents","","<p>Out of towners who stay at ""the hotel"" in Jefferson are categorized in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> as ""drummers and lawyers and court-witnesses"" (189).  ""Drummers"" are traveling salesmen.</p>","Yes"

The other settlers expect the two slaves to help with that work, but Compson invokes ""the rigid protocol of bondage"" - that is, the unwritten rules that govern master-slave relations - and says no ""house-servant"" like the coachman can be ordered to do ""manual labor"" (27).</p>","Yes"

This man is one of the ""carpetbaggers"" who come to Jefferson at the end of the Civil War, a deserter from the Union Army who arrives ""riding a mule"" and, according to the tales that were later told about him, bringing with him ""for saddle-blanket sheaf on sheaf of virgin and uncut United States banknotes"" - no doubt nefariously obtained (183).

"23231","3155","Unnamed Freedmen","Unnamed Freedmen","","<p>In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> the people who were formerly enslaved in Jackson and elsewhere are referred to, tangentially, in the negative characterization of the Federal officials who administered the post-war attempt at Reconstruction: they are the ""freed slaves"" whose votes those ""carpet-baggers"" know how to manipulate (87).  Presumably this group also includes the students who attend Jackson's three ""College[s] for Negroes""; the colleges are mentioned in the text but not the people who attend them (87).</p>","No"

"23222","3146","Unnamed Descendants of Modern Planter","Unnamed Descendants of Modern Planter","","<p>In its account of modern changes in Yoknapatawpha, <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> focuses on the generational experience of the ""son"" of the large plantation, who goes to World War II from ""the seat of the tractor"" with which he, rather than his father's tenants, works the land; upon his return he leaves behind ""the long monotonous endless unendable furrows of Mississippi cotton fields"" to live with his wife and growing family ""in automobile trailers of G.I. barracks on the outskirts of liberal arts colleges"" (193).

The thieves and whiskey makers go ""to trial"" from the jail; the murderers go ""to eternity from there,"" since technological progress has brought the electric chair to Jefferson (198).

"23218","3142","Unnamed Chippeway Indians","Unnamed Chippeway Indians","","<p>In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, these are the eighteen Indians in the party led by La Salle on the voyage of discovery down the Mississippi.  It seems likely that at least some of them, like the canoes they traveled in, are Chippewa (or as the narrator refers to them, ""Chippeway,"" 81): the Chippewa were part of the Ojibwe language group that lived along and near the St. Lawrence River in Canada.</p>","No"
"23217","3141","Unnamed Children of Pioneers and Indians","Unnamed Children of Pioneers and Indians","","<p>According to the history of Jackson in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, ""the Anglo-Saxon"" pioneer not only fought the Indians he found in the territory; he also fathered children on some of them: ""scattering his ebullient seed in a hundred dusky bellies through a thousand miles of wilderness"" (81-82).  ""Dusky bellies"" is ambiguous, but almost certainly refers to Indian women.  And while miscegenation between black and white in Faulkner's world made one a 'Negro' and socially inferior, it was common for 'white' southerners to boast of a Native American ancestor on the family tree.</p>","Yes"
"23216","3140","Unnamed Anglo-Saxon Pioneers","Unnamed Anglo-Saxon Pioneers","","<p>The history of Mississippi as recounted in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> includes ""the Anglo-Saxon, the pioneer"" who came into the area after it became part of the U.S. (81), part of the group referred to as ""the pioneers, the hunters, the forest men with rifles"" (171).  The narrator identifies ""the pioneer"" as male - ""the tall man, roaring with Protestant scripture and boiled whiskey"" (81) - but with him comes his and his wife's family.  We include in this group the ""brawling teamsters and trappers and flatboatmen"" who often are held in the jail (180).  As the institutions of society move into the region, this figure becomes ""obsolete,"" vanishing like the Indians, the Spaniards and the Frenchmen who lived there before him because ""only the wilderness could feed and nourish him"" (82).</p>","Yes"

The younger brother of Alabama Red, the sexual partner of Temple Drake whom Popeye murdered in <em>Sanctuary</em>, Pete comes to Jefferson after finding the salacious letters Temple wrote eight years earlier to his brother.   When he brings them back into Temple's life, he becomes both her blackmailer and her lover, the ""next one"" she falls in love with (132).

"23210","3134","Nancy Mannigoe","Mannigoe, Nancy","","<p>As ""Nancy"" this black woman appears in ""That Evening Sun"" (1931) as a laundress and part-time servant of the Compson family who also sells herself as a prostitute to white men who don't always keep their promise to pay her.   She is terrified of the black man in her life, whom Faulkner provocatively names ""Jesus.""  Nancy prays that her Jesus will not come again, but the story ends without settling that issue. There is evidence that in the early 1930s Faulkner apparently began a longer narrative that would develop Nancy's life and character more fully, but it was never completed.  Two decades later, however, when Faulkner decided to write a sequel to <em>Sanctuary</em> - also published in 1931 - he decided to include Nancy in it, as ""Nancy Mannigoe,"" a servant in the Stevens rather than the Compson family.  Temple Stevens (nee Drake) hires her to take care of three children: her son, her infant daughter and herself, or at least the part of Temple herself that remains haunted by her own experience with the dark side of life.  The three-act drama at the center of <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> is not Nancy's story, but it is organized around Nancy's sentencing and execution for the murder of that infant, whom ""she smothered in its cradle"" in what she believes is a just cause, one that her God will forgive (39).  (In a kind of aside, the Governor and Stevens discuss ""Nancy's heritage,"" as reflected in that last name Faulkner gives her in the novel (94).  Manigault (pronounced <em>manigo</em>) is, as the Governor notes, an ""old Charleston name"" (94).  Historically, Peter Manigault, a slave owner and politician in South Carolina, was probably the richest man in colonial America.  Gavin goes further, replying that the name ""Maingault"" connects Nancy to the ""Normans"" who conquered England in 1066.)</p>","Yes"

He was educated by white Americans in Nashville.  Elected ""first [or principal] chief of the Choctaw nation"" in 1830 (84), he signed the treaty ceding the tribe's lands to the U.S., but when most of the tribe 'removed' west of the Mississippi River, he remained in Mississippi, where he became a large slave-owner and planter and served several terms in the state legislature.  Although the novel's narrator says he named his plantation ""in honor of a French king's mistress"" (85), the name he actually gave it - ""Malmaison"" - pays tribute to a French emperor's wife; that was the name of the residence of the Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon.</p>","No"

"23204","3128","Hemingway","Hemingway, Ernest","","<p>Ernest Hemingway was the American writer whom Faulkner considered his rival for most of his career, though the two men had a cordial long distance relationship and Faulkner often alluded to or quoted from Hemingway in public statements.  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> Temple alludes to Hemingway's 1940 novel <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em> to explain that a woman who has been sexually assaulted could be in denial that it had happened to her: ""it had never actually happened to a g-- woman, if she just refused to accept it, no matter who remembered, bragged"" (121).  In <em>The Mansion</em> Hemingway himself almost makes an appearance; he is mentioned in Linda Snopes Kohl's account of her experience in the Spanish Civil War, which Hemingway covered as a war correspondent (and where <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em> is set).</p>","No"

In the stage directions he is identified not with Mississippi but with a ""mythical"" State, ""the State of which Yoknapatawpha County is a unit"" (89) - though elsewhere in the novel there is no ambiguity about the literary 'fact' that Yoknapatawpha is in Mississippi.  The Governor has ""obviously just been routed out of bed or at least out of his study or dressing room"" (90). He listens sympathetically as Temple Drake confesses her moral complicity in the events in Memphis years earlier and more recently in Jefferson, but makes it clear that he can do nothing to stay the execution.</p>","No"

But since Mississippi had not yet been re-admitted to the Union, he never served in that office.  To unreconstructed Mississippians, he was a carpetbagger, which explains how he acquired the unflattering sobriquet that <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> uses to refer to him: ""Buzzard"" (87).</p>","Yes"

In the guide's section on Jackson, DeFrance is referred to as ""superintendent of public buildings at Washington, D.C.""; the novel uses the same phrase, minus the ""D.C.""

The pioneers are the whites who acquire their land in the ""wilderness"" directly from the Indians who were already there (200); it isn't long before they become ""the older residents"" (206) who are followed into the region by the settlers, the ""new names and faces"" who make up much of the community at the time of the story (206).  The character called Compson is among this second group, but the rest are nameless, and described as ""so new"" that they have ""no discernible antecedents or past at all"" (206).

Stevens refers to these ""tense and furious circumnavigators"" a bit dismissively, to set up a comparison with the poet Homer, who exemplifies the more impressive capacity of the human heart to ""plumb and chart the ultimate frontiers"" while remaining in one place (200).</p>","No"

"23180","3105","Unnamed Farmers 6","Unnamed Farmers 6","","<p>These Yoknapatawpha farmers are part of ""Knight's Gambit"" in two ways.  As a larger group, they become part of the audience that watches as Mr. Harriss transforms a traditional county plantation into a kind of Hollywood set.  Some of them cross ""the whole county"" to watch the landscapers and builders at work (161), and ""farmers"" are specifically included in the groups of spectators who attend the sporting events that are staged there (163).  In addition, for the farm families who live along the county roads that Harriss' out-of-town guests speed up and down, the Harriss property becomes ""a secondary source of rural income"":  whenever one of those cars runs over one of their ""hogs"" or ""mules"" or ""hens,"" they can be compensated in cash by simply applying at the Harriss' front door (163).</p>","Yes"

Gavin is exaggerating, but in fact over 30,000,000 men were killed or wounded during this war, the first great global conflict.  In the same conversation he refers to two different categories of combatants, comparing ""the groundling during his crawling minutes and the airman during his condensed seconds"" (242).

Most delivery boys and men in the fictions are black, which would give additional possible meaning to the term ""boy,"" but since Faulkner does not specify this character's race - and based on the character who delivers telegrams to Jason Compson in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> - we assume this one is white.</p>","Yes"
"23173","3098","Unnamed Smugglers","Unnamed Smugglers","","<p>When telling his nephew about the Russian woman whom he knew in Paris after the First World War in ""Knight's Gambit,"" Gavin Stevens refers, elliptically, to the way her escape from Moscow was arranged by ""different collectors"" whom she ""paid by installments, over a long time"" afterward (247).  Many Russian aristocrats fled the country after the Russian Revolution in 1917, but there's no obvious way to know what Stevens means by calling the men who were paid to help this woman ""collectors.""  We're calling them 'Smugglers' to describe what they do, but perhaps they are also 'collectors,' or at least involved in smuggling art for collectors out of revolutionary Russia.</p>","No"
"23172","3097","Unnamed Secretary","Unnamed Secretary","","<p>According to ""Knight's Gambit,"" the end of Harriss' story follows a familiar pattern: ""One morning your lawyer’s secretary telephones your wife long distance in Europe and says you just died sitting at your desk"" (167).

Stevens is talking to his young nephew about her, which may be why his account of the woman and the relationship is so vague, but the facts that she went ""through a war too"" and had to ""escape from Moscow"" by paying others to help her suggest she is a Russian aristocrat, driven into exile by the Russian Revolution of 1917.  And the fact that Stevens says the letters he wrote her ""flowed from somewhere around, amid the intestines"" suggests that the relationship was primarily sexual (248).  At any rate, he says this relationship ""did not exist in the same world"" as his formal engagement with the Yoknapatawpha woman he eventually marries (248).</p>","No"

"23155","3080","Unnamed Landholders","Unnamed Landholders","","<p>The description in ""Knight's Gambit"" of the people who watch the polo matches at the Harriss plantation includes (separate from the ""farmers"" and ""the tenants and renters and croppers"") a group it calls ""the landholders"" (163).  This presumably refers to the owners of the farm land that is worked by the tenants, renters and sharecroppers, though Faulkner usually refers to them as landlords or land owners - or ""planters,"" the word he uses elsewhere in the story: ""the bottomland planters” (251).</p>","Yes"
"23154","2999","Unnamed Japanese Aviator","Unnamed Japanese Aviator","","<p>Several thousand Japanese sailors and aviators participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor that provoked the U.S. to declare war, but this entry reflects the unusual way Charles Mallison describes the attack in ""Knight's Gambit"": ""a Jap dropped a bomb on another American"" (254).</p>","No"
"23153","2998","Unnamed Inspector-General","Unnamed Inspector-General","","<p>This ""inspector-general"" in ""Knight's Gambit"" is apparently part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, which was officially organized in 1915 to train male college students in military tactics and discipline (205).  He certifies the high quality of the  R.O.T.C. program that Charles Mallison participates in as a student at the Academy in Jefferson.  R.O.T.C. programs are usually based in colleges and universities, but according to Charles, ""although the Academy was only a prep school, it had one of the highest R.O.T.C. ratings in the country,"" and the inspector-general assures him and his classmates that ""when war comes"" they will be almost automatically eligible for officer-candidate school (205).</p>","Yes"

"23151","2996","Unnamed Holocaust Victims","Unnamed Holocaust Victims","","<p>When Charles Mallison explains Gualdres' reason for enlisting in the fight against Nazi Germany in ""Knight's Gambit,"" he includes among the possible reasons the fact that the Germans ""were rendering a whole race into fertilizer and lubricating oil"" - an odd and perhaps callous way to refer to the Nazi campaign to exterminate the Jewish population of Europe (255).  (Gualdres' actual reason, according to Charles, is that the Germans ""had abolished horses from civilized cavalry,"" 255).</p>","No"

Maggie Mallison is one of these women, but none of the others are named.</p>","Yes"
"23147","2992","Unnamed Grandfather of Mrs. Harriss","Unnamed Grandfather of Mrs. Harriss","","<p>This character 'appears' in ""Knight's Gambit"" by way of one of Faulkner's typical negative formulations, in the middle of a sentence that develops the idea that Sebastian Gualdres is a ""stranger"" in Yoknapatawpha by noting that, when locals visit him at the Backus-Harriss Plantation, they are ""guests not of the woman who owned the place and whose family name they had known all her life and her father's and grandfather's too"" - that is, they are his guests (174).  But the point here is that this woman - Mrs. Harriss - had this grandfather, and he lived in Yoknapatawpha, although that is all we know about him. Compounding the complexity of the family history here is that ""Mrs. Harriss"" only gets a ""family name"" in the later novel, <em>The Town</em>, where she is identified as Melisandre Backus.  That family name links her genealogically to characters originally mentioned in ""My Grandmother Millard"" 6 years before ""Knight's Gambit"" (and 14 years before <em>The Town</em>).  Does this mean Faulkner was thinking of Mrs. Harriss' grandfather in ""Knight's Gambit"" as Philip St-Just Backus, or perhaps a son of his?  There is no way to answer a question like this, but in a ""cumulative character"" index I suppose it has to be asked.</p>","Yes"

Faulkner refers to this same large group again in <em>The Town</em>, but other than the Sartoris twins as aviators and the one soldier in the unit from Yoknapatawpha who was wounded in combat, they only appear as customers in Montgomery Ward Snopes' two brothels, and that only generically: ""any time a soldier"" wanted, for instance, ""he could buy a ticket from Montgomery Ward and go around through the back door and get his-self entertained"" (120).</p>","No"

It's clear that this young ""nurse"" - that is, wet nurse - has caught his eye, but nothing else about her is known.

Some of them ""have some vague connection with cotton or automobiles or land- and stock-sales""; all of them bet on ""prize fights and punchboards and national ballgames"" (39).

"23121","2966","Unnamed Women in Civil War Jefferson","Unnamed Women in Civil War Jefferson","","<p>According to <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, old houses like Miss Habersham's ""still seem to be spellbound by the shades of women, old women still spinsters and widows waiting . . . waiting for the slow telegraph to bring them news of Tennessee and Virginia and Pennsylvania battles"" (117).</p>","Yes"

One irony of <em>Intruder</em> is that the absence of the black population results in the narrative describing them in more detail than any other Yoknapatawpha fiction provides.</p>","Yes"
"23116","2961","Unnamed Strangers","Unnamed Strangers","","<p>In the last chapter of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> we learn that ""for weeks"" after the story ends, these ""strangers"" would ask the people of Yoknapatawpha how a man in jail could get hold of a gun to shoot himself with (232).

"23115","2960","Unnamed Spinster","Unnamed Spinster","","<p>This ""old lady, dead now"" is called a ""spinster"" by the narrator of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>.

"23112","2957","Unnamed Sawmill Workers 2","Unnamed Sawmill Workers 2","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> the crew who work in the sawmill where trees from Sudley Workitt's land are turned into lumber are ""hired by the day"" (219).  They are almost certainly not the same men as the ""three youngish white men from the crew of a nearby sawmill"" (18).  The two sawmills are close enough in space, but not in time: that earlier group appears three years before the Gowrie's begin harvesting Workitt's timber.</p>","Yes"
"23111","2956","Unnamed Sawmill Workers 1","Unnamed Sawmill Workers 1","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> these three ""youngish white men from the crew of a nearby sawmill"" are all ""a little drunk"" in Fraser's store when Lucas Beauchamp enters (18). One of them, with ""a reputation for brawling and violence,"" is more than a little racist: he goes after Lucas for his attitude, calling him ""biggity"" among other names (18, 19).

"23109","2954","Unnamed Photographer","Unnamed Photographer","","<p>The man who photographed Lucas and Molly for the studio portrait that Chick sees in their cabin in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> is not described, but at Lucas' insistence he did take Molly's headrag off.</p>","Yes"
"23108","2953","Unnamed People at the Football Game","Unnamed People at the Football Game","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> the crowd of spectators at the football game in the Mottstown high school stadium is divided between the people who ""sit in the grandstand"" and ""the ones trotting and even running up and down the sideline following each play"" (122).</p>","Yes"
"23107","2952","Unnamed People at Fraser's Store","Unnamed People at Fraser's Store","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, ""every tenant and renter and freeholder white or black in the neighborhood"" would find a reason to go to the crossroads store on Saturdays, ""quite often to buy something"" but also often just to visit with each other (18).</p>","Yes"

"23105","2950","Unnamed Original Inhabitants of Jefferson","Unnamed Original Inhabitants of Jefferson","","<p>According to Gavin Stevens in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, ""all the men"" who first came to Jefferson worked together to build it, ""to shape a land for their posterity"" (49); according to this account, ""the jailer then"" or the ""innkeeper or farrier or vegetable peddler"" could be ""what the lawyer and planter and doctor and parson called a gentleman"" (49).  This definition of ""all the men"" leaves out the ones who were enslaved.</p>","Yes"
"23104","2949","Unnamed Negro Girls and Women","Unnamed Negro Girls and Women","","<p>According to <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, on a typical evening one would see ""Negro girls and women"" outside the window of the jail, talking with the black men who are confined inside it (38).  Even though the exceptional circumstances of the story have kept them away and in hiding, the narrator describes them as ""the women in the aprons of cooks or nurses and the girls in their flash cheap clothes from the mail order houses"" (50).</p>","Yes"
"23103","2948","Unnamed Negro Domestics","Unnamed Negro Domestics","","<p>The Negro servants who work for the white population of Jefferson are almost completely invisible in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>.  This is by their own actions: anxious about what might happen after Lucas is arrested for killing a white man, they stop going outside, even to work.  But their absence provokes two descriptions of who they are, or at least what they look like, under conventional circumstances.  On Sunday morning Chick imagines the ""housemaids or cooks in their fresh Sunday aprons"" on the porches of their employers' homes (38).  On Monday, though ""still no Negro had [been] seen,"" the narrator provides this description of who isn't visible, which subdivides this group by generation and gender: ""the young ones with straightened hair and makeup,"" wearing ""tomorrow's clothes from mailorder houses,"" who don't put on their servants' ""caps and aprons until they were inside the white kitchens""; ""the older ones in the ankle-length homemade calico and gingham who wore the long plain homemade aprons all the time""; and ""the men who should have been mowing the lawns and clipping the hedges"" (118-19).  It's ironic, perhaps intentionally, that thanks to these descriptions of who <em>isn't</em> there, <em>Intruder</em> provides more information about the larger black population that works in Jefferson's white households than just about any other fiction.</p>","Yes"
"23102","2947","Unnamed Negro Inmates 5","Unnamed Negro Inmates 5","","<p>When Sheriff Hampton goes out to investigate Vinson Gowrie's grave in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, he takes along two Negro prisoners from the jail to do the digging.  Both are dressed in ""blue jumpers and the soiled black-ringed convict pants which the street gangs wore"" (136; in this context ""street gangs"" are chain gangs or convict work gangs).  The narrative makes no effort to distinguish these ""two Negroes,"" as they are repeatedly called (154, 156, 157, etc.).  Both are equally anxious about their task, especially when Vinson's father appears.</p>","Yes"
"23101","2946","Unnamed Negro Clients of Mrs. Down","Unnamed Negro Clients of Mrs. Down","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> a steady stream of Negroes goes in and out of the house of the fortune-teller Mrs. Downs ""all day long and without doubt most of the night""  (69).</p>","Yes"

"23099","2944","Unnamed Murdered Man","Unnamed Murdered Man","","<p>According to Sheriff Hampton in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, Jake Montgomery's Tennessee roadhouse was closed by the police after ""a man went and got killed in it one night two-three years ago"" (112-13).</p>","No"
"23098","2943","Unnamed Mother of Football Player","Unnamed Mother of Football Player","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> this ""mother"" is mentioned only as one possible reason why a starting player on the Jefferson high school football team won't play in the game against Mottstown (121).</p>","Yes"
"23097","2942","Unnamed Mother of Boon Hogganbeck","Unnamed Mother of Boon Hogganbeck","","<p>Boon Hogganbeck's ""mother's mother"" was a ""Chickasaw woman"" (91).  Boon and his Chickasaw grandmother are mentioned in a number of Faulkner texts, but the only mention of his <em>mother</em> in the fictions is the passing acknowledgment paid her in this phrase in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>.  From the other texts, however, we can safely infer that she - and her never mentioned father, and Boon's never mentioned father - were white.</p>","Yes"
"23096","2941","Unnamed Memphis Investigator","Unnamed Memphis Investigator","","<p>The hypothetical ""expert that can tell about bullets"" (71) whom Chick imagines in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>; ""somebody from the Memphis police"" (188)  that Chick assumes Sheriff Hampton will have to call in.

"23095","2940","Unnamed Football Players 2","Unnamed Football Players 2","","<p>The narrator of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> calls the Jefferson high school football team that travels to Mottstown ""the regular team"" (121), which presumably means the varsity.  After their victory, three of them return to Jefferson in the car that Chick's mother hired.</p>","Yes"
"23094","2939","Unnamed Man in Nightshirt","Unnamed Man in Nightshirt","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> Chick's fantasy of Miss Habersham's long drive through the counties around Yoknapatawpha climaxes when, along a lonely country road, she is confronted by ""a man in his nightshirt and unlaced shoes, carrying a lantern,"" who asks her where she's trying to go (185).</p>","No"
"23093","2938","Unnamed Man in Mob 4","Unnamed Man in Mob 4","","<p>This is ""the fourth"" of the four men in the mob outside the jail who speak to Sheriff Hampton on Monday morning in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>.

"23088","2933","Unnamed Lady Poet","Unnamed Lady Poet","","<p>The real name of the writer whom Gavin Stevens calls ""a sound sensitive lady poet of the time of my youth"" (191) in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> is Djuna Barnes, well known in the years after World War I as part of the Modernist movement in the arts.  Today she is best known as the author of the lesbian novel <em>Nightwood</em> (1936), but she was also a visual artist, a journalist and, as Gavin's description says, a poet.  The lines he quotes are taken, with a line omitted, from Barnes' poem ""To the Dead Favourite of Liu Ch'e"" (1920).</p>","No"
"23087","2932","Unnamed Jefferson Merchants and Professionals 3","Unnamed Jefferson Merchants and Professionals 3","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> Chick compares the way Lucas Beauchamp dresses when he comes to town in his necktie and vest to the appearance of ""the merchants and doctors and lawyers"" who work in Jefferson (24).

This driver takes her and her son Chick out to the Mallison farm.  Drivers in the Yoknapatawpha fictions are typically black, but by not identifying this one as a Negro, the brief description of him - ""a man from the garage"" (70) - suggests he is more likely to be white.</p>","Yes"
"23084","2929","Unnamed German Officer","Unnamed German Officer","","<p>The gun with which Vinson Gowrie was shot in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> was ""an automatic pistol"" taken from a German officer captured by Buddy McCallum during World War I (161).</p>","No"

"23081","2926","Unnamed Woman in Frenchman's Bend 1","Unnamed Woman in Frenchman's Bend 1","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> this woman started a feud over a ""church bazaar"" baking prize with ""another lady"" in Frenchman's Bend (227).  When she reported that the other woman's husband was making and selling whiskey, Sheriff Hampton had to intervene.  As these details suggest, the narrative uses the title ""Frenchman's Bend lady"" sarcastically (227).</p>","Yes"
"23080","2925","Unnamed Football Player","Unnamed Football Player","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> Chick gets to play in a varsity football game in Mottstown when this ""regular player"" cannot (121).

"23059","2904","Worsham|Habersham, Father of Belle|Eunice","Worsham|Habersham, Father of Belle|Eunice","Doctor Habersham","<p>This character's name reflects what is probably just be Faulkner's forgetfulness about recurring characters, though he may have had a reason for over-writing the Worshams with the Habershams between 1942 and 1948.  In any case, the character named Belle Worsham in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> is the daughter of a man who left her a ""decaying house"" in Jefferson (260, 356); the same character is named Eunice Habersham in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, where the narrative points out that the house she lives in ""had not been painted since her father died"" (74).

She is buried in the cemetery next to Caledonia chapel, and from her headstone we learn that she was born in 1878 and died in 1926 (99).  That is all the novel explicitly says about her, but ""Workitt"" appears in the novel on the list of the most common family names in Beat Four (28).</p>","Yes"

"23049","2894","Adam Fraser","Fraser, Adam","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> Adam Fraser owns the ""crossroads store"" (18) near the scene of Vinson Gowrie's murder.

By consulting a white fortune-teller, Ephriam finds out where Maggie Mallison's lost ring can be found (69).

Without exception, these would-be suitors ""look away"" from her once Ikkemotubbe's interest becomes known (363).  They even help him in his efforts to attract her attention.  At the end of the story, at least some of these ""young men"" leave the plantation on the steamboat with David Hogganbeck and Ikkemotubbe (380), but the text does not say how far they go.</p>","Yes"
"23042","2887","Unnamed Wife of David Colbert","Unnamed Wife of David Colbert","","<p>In ""A Courtship,"" this woman is the great-aunt of the second cousin of Herman Basket's aunt (363).  As the wife of the ""chief Man of the Chickasaws"" (365), she would have a lot of status.  From her, Herman Basket's aunt acquires both a ""silver wine pitcher"" (363) and a belief in her own family's superiority.</p>","No"
"23041","2886","Unnamed Whisky-Trader 2","Unnamed Whisky-Trader 2","","<p>In ""A Courtship"" the ""whisky-trader"" who apparently makes regular visits to the Chickasaws brings the whiskey on which the tribe's young men get Log-in-the-Creek drunk (364).  What he trades his whiskey for is not specified.</p>","Yes"
"23040","2885","Unnamed Uncle of Herman Basket","Unnamed Uncle of Herman Basket","","<p>""Dead"" before ""A Courtship"" begins, this man is mentioned as the original owner of the ""shotgun"" that Herman Basket's aunt threatens to use on her niece's suitors (368).</p>","Yes"
"23039","2884","Unnamed Ten-Year-Old Chickasaw Boy","Unnamed Ten-Year-Old Chickasaw Boy","","<p>In ""A Courtship,"" before Ikkemotubbe and David Hogganbeck's eating contest begins, this ""ten-year-old boy"" runs around the race-track once, to give the contestants a chance to recover their breath (372).</p>","Yes"
"23038","2883","Unnamed Sister of Herman Basket","Unnamed Sister of Herman Basket","","<p>The phrase the narrator of ""A Courtship"" uses to describe Herman Basket's sister - ""she walks in beauty"" - sounds faintly 'Indian' but is actually borrowed from Lord Byron (362).  Or ""sat in it, that is,"" he adds - which sounds pretty risque, though becomes less so when he adds that she doesn't walk at all ""unless she had to"" (362).  Like Eula Varner in Faulkner's Snopes trilogy, she is lazy and slovenly but exercises an irresistible power over all the men who see her.  While she is at the center of the story's courtship plot, she does not actually speak a single word in it.  On the other hand, she makes a very powerful statement at the end of all the various courtships when she chooses Log-in-the-River.</p>","Yes"
"23037","2882","Unnamed Second Cousin of Herman Basket's Aunt","Unnamed Second Cousin of Herman Basket's Aunt","","<p>The ""second cousin"" of Herman Basket's aunt is also the ""grand-niece of the wife of old David Colbert"" (363, 365).

"23036","2881","Unnamed Father of Narrator 2","Unnamed Father of Narrator 2","","<p>The father of the Chickasaw Indian who narrates ""A Courtship"" advises Ikkemotubbe about the best strategy for courting Herman Basket's sister, and helps Owl-by-Night look for Ikkemotubbe's horse.  Along with ""the young men,"" he also stokes the fire in the steamboat at the end of the story (380), which leaves open a possibility that the text never develops: perhaps like Ikkemotubbe, the narrator's father ""went away"" from the plantation (362).</p>","Yes"
"23034","2880","Unnamed Slaves of Indians 6","Unnamed Slaves of Indians 6","","<p>A number of Mississippi Indians did own slaves, and in ""Red Leaves"" and ""A Justice,"" Faulkner's other Indian stories, he explores this theme in detail.   In ""A Courtship,"" however, it only appears in the narrator's brief mention of the black people whom Ikkemotubbe brings with him when he returns to the plantation three years after the story's main events: the ""eight new slaves which we did not need"" (363), later referred to as ""the eight more slaves which we had no use for"" (379).  That second phrase suggests the tribe already possesses other slaves, which is the case when Ikkemotubbe brings <em>six</em> slaves on his return in ""A Justice,"" but there is no mention of them in this story.  Neither phrase tells us anything about the enslaved people themselves.</p>","Yes"
"23033","2879","Unnamed Enslaved Boy 3","Unnamed Enslaved Boy 3","","<p>The ""boy slave who turned the wheel"" is the steersman on Studenmare's steamboat (366).  His age is not given, but the narrator of ""A Courtship"" notes that he is ""not much more than half as big as Captain Studenmare"" (366).</p>","Yes"
"23032","2878","Unnamed Aunt of Herman Basket","Unnamed Aunt of Herman Basket","","<p>The unnamed aunt whom Herman Basket and his sister live with in ""A Courtship"" seems to be their surrogate parent; the other Chickasaw often hear her voice when it is raised to scold her niece's laziness.  She is also actively involved in her niece's courtship.  It is to ingratiate himself and his cause with her that Ikkemotubbe sends a pony and his gamecocks as gifts, and when the suitors won't behave she does not hesitate to threaten them with a shotgun.  She feels that her family is superior to ""Issetibbeha's whole family"" (365).  What role she may play in her niece's ultimate choice, however, is not revealed.</p>","Yes"
"23031","2877","Sylvester's John","Sylvester's John","","<p>Although his name evokes the way enslaved Negroes were often named, Sylvester's John is actually one of the young Chickasaw men who are interested in Herman Basket's sister in ""A Courtship"" - until it becomes clear that Ikkemotubbe wants her.  After that, he is one of the young men who willingly help Ikkemotubbe's courtship.</p>","Yes"
"23030","2876","Captain Studenmare","Studenmare, Captain","","<p>In ""A Courtship,"" Captain Studenmare is the owner of the steamboat that visits the Chickasaw plantation annually.  He depends upon another man, David Hogganbeck, to pilot it.  After he fires Hogganbeck for dereliction, he is forced to return to Natchez overland with his ""steamboat slaves,"" the enslaved Negroes who do the physical work on board the ship (378).</p>","Yes"
"23029","2875","Log-in-the-Creek","Log-in-the-Creek","","<p>In ""A Courtship,"" Log-in-the-Creek is the only one of the Chickasaw young men who does not stop courting Herman Basket's sister after Ikkemotubbe's interest in her becomes known.  His unheroic name seems to fit his apparently negligible character: he cannot hold his liquor, and he ""raced no horses and fought no cocks and cast no dice"" (364).  ""Nobody paid any attention to him"" (363), though the sound of the harmonica he plays constantly while sitting outside Herman Basket's house is a persistent source of aggravation to the other male Chickasaw, but perhaps it speaks differently to Herman Basket's sister.   Her ultimate choice for a mate has been read as a triumph for the artist over the warrior.</p>","Yes"
"23028","2874","David Hogganbeck","Hogganbeck, David","","<p>The character David Hogganbeck in ""A Courtship"" evokes the heroes of American tall tales about the frontier.  ""Bigger than any two"" of the Chickasaw men ""put together"" (366), he is a skilled steamboat pilot, an accomplished fiddle player, a formidable opponent in eating, drinking and dancing competitions, and Ikkemotubbe's chivalrous rival for the hand of Herman Basket's sister.  For her love he is willing to throw off his job, and for his Indian rival he is willing to lose his life.  Although the story does not say so, Faulkner himself said that he is the grandfather of Boon Hogganbeck, who appears in many of the Yoknapatawpha fictions.</p>","Yes"
"23027","2873","David Colbert","Colbert, David","","<p>The character whom the narrator of ""A Courtship"" refers to twice as ""old David Colbert"" (365, 374) is presumably based on a real historical figure, Levi Colbert.  The son of white father from North Carolina and a Chickasaw mother, he grew up among the Indians.  Among the real Chickasaws (unlike Faulkner's) kinship was defined in matrilineal terms, and through his mother's lineage and his own accomplishments Colbert eventually became head chief of the Chickasaw nation - or as the story says about ""David,"" ""the chief Man of all the Chickasaws in our section"" (365).  Until the ""removal"" of the Chickasaws in the 1830s, he lived in the area along the Mississippi-Alabama border.</p>","No"

He is dressed in ""neat city clothes"" (126), and speaks with a ""cold"" voice, yet is described as being in ""a sort of seething boil"" about the shooting (126).  Suspecting something after meeting with ""Old Man Pritchel"" in person (126), he goes out of his way to tell the sheriff about the imminent sale of the Pritchel farm.</p>","Yes"

"23017","2863","Joel Flint","Flint, Joel","","<p>Joel Flint, the protean villain in ""An Error in Chemistry,"" used to work in carnivals. At one point he was known as Signor Canova, a master of illusion. After abandoning the Canova persona, Flint started working in other circuses, serving as ""bandsman, ringman, Bornean wild man"" (134). Eventually, his role in traveling carnivals was as a pitch man with a ""roulette wheel wired against imitation watches and pistols which would not shoot"" (134). His carnival came to Yoknapatawpha, and when the show packed up and left,  Flint stayed on and married Ellie Pritchell, the ""dim-witted spinster"" daughter of misanthrope Wesley Prichell (113).

"23012","2858","Dilsey's Family","Dilsey's Family","","<p>Dilsey, her daughter Frony, her son TP, and her grandson Luster have separate entries in the ""Appendix Compson"" and in our database.  This entry, however, represents the collective group referred to in the ""Appendix"" as ""Dilsey's family,"" who lived as a group in the ""one servant's cabin"" left on the Compson property (330).

"23011","2857","Unnamed Enslaved People 3","Unnamed Enslaved People 3","","<p>There are two references in ""Appendix Compson"" to the slaves who lived in Yoknapatawpha before the Civil War.  The term ""slaves"" appears only in reference to the ""shiftless slaves"" owned by the descendants of the Chickasaw tribe who remain in the region after the Indian Removal (329).  But the Compson family, like the other ""masters of plantations"" in Yoknapatawpha, owned a number of slaves as well (328).  Their existence is indicated by  the ""slavequarters"" listed among the structures on the Compson estate (328), and by Jason IV's reference to Lincoln freeing them ""from the Compsons"" in 1865 (340).</p>","Yes"

But he picks her up and installs her in a seat when she is overwhelmed by the crowds at the Memphis bus station.  Although he is presumably part of the crowd of ""soldiers and sailors enroute either to leave or to death"" in the Second World War (337), Faulkner reasserts the humanity of those that make up the crowd through this soldier's stateside actions.</p>","No"

"23008","2854","Unnamed Carpetbagger from New England","Unnamed Carpetbagger from New England","","<p>The derisive term ""carpetbagger"" (derived from the material used to make cheap luggage) refers to Northerners who came into the South after the Civil War; depending on one's politics, they came either to reconstruct or to prey on the defeated South.  Faulkner's carpetbaggers tend toward economic, rather than political, influence in Jefferson.  In ""Appendix Compson,"" the demands of this ""New England carpetbagger"" against the Compson estate prompt Jason to sell off small sections of his land, thus enabling the Snopeses to ""encroach"" on his holdings (329).</p>","Yes"

Napoleon reinstated the rank of marshal, the highest military rank in France, in 1804, and appointed 26 marshals, 18 of them in one month.  These men were notable for reflecting his own preferences, rather than for having reached a given level of accomplishment.

His hope of claiming the throne ended in 1746, when the Jacobites were defeated in a final battle in Scotland.  Charles himself is perhaps best remembered for a romantic escape through the Scottish countryside after that loss.  Although he was seen by many during his flight from Scotland, no one turned him in to claim the hefty reward offered by the British government.

"23003","2849","Unnamed Jefferson Police","Unnamed Jefferson Police","","<p>The officers of the law in Jason Compson IV's entry in ""Appendix Compson"" are described from the anxious perspective of his own criminality: when his niece takes the money he's been embezzling, he cannot turn to them for help recovering it without admitting more of his affairs than he cares to, and yet he chafes at paying for a police force that he characterizes as existing in ""parasitic and sadistic idleness"" (342).</p>","Yes"
"23002","2848","Unnamed Jefferson Ladies 4","Unnamed Jefferson Ladies 4","","<p>These ""wives of the bankers and doctors and lawyers"" of Jefferson in ""Appendix Compson""- including some who were part of the ""old highschool class"" with Melissa Meek and Caddy Compson - are very concerned to appear respectable: they keep the racier modern romance novels they check out of the town library ""carefully wrapped from view in sheets of Memphis and Jackson newspapers"" (333).</p>","Yes"
"23001","2847","Unnamed Indians in Oklahoma","Unnamed Indians in Oklahoma","","<p>The Chickasaw were one of several tribes that were displaced by President Jackson's Indian Removal Act of 1830.

He and that relationship are further characterized by the photo's luxurious background: ""a Cannebiere backdrop of mountains and palms and cypresses and the sea, an open powerful expensive chromiumtrimmed sports car,"" all of which are featured in ""a slick magazine - a picture filled with luxury and money and sunlight"" (334).</p>","No"
"22997","2843","Unnamed Feedstore Customers","Unnamed Feedstore Customers","","<p>These ""overalled men"" in ""Appendix Compson"" are customers at the farmers' supply store where Jason IV owns a business buying and selling cotton (334).  Although the customers are explicitly male, since the store is a ""gloomy cavern which only men ever entered"" (333), their race is not so clearly defined; the narrative indicates that the store serves ""Mississippi farmers or at least Negro Mississippi farmers"" (334), indicating that many, if not most of the customers are African-American.</p>","Yes"

"22992","2838","Unnamed Bus Passengers","Unnamed Bus Passengers","","<p>When Melissa Meek gets there in ""Appendix Compson,"" the bus station in Memphis is filled with ""a few middleaged civilians but mostly soldiers and sailors enroute either to leave or to death and the homeless young women, their companions"" (337).</p>","No"

"22990","2836","Melissa Meek","Meek, Melissa","","<p>In ""Appendix Compson,"" Melissa Meek is the ""county librarian, a mouse-sized and -colored woman who had never married,"" and also a former classmate of Caddy Compson who sees a photo of her in occupied France (333).  Attempting to ""save"" Caddy enables Meek to transcend the characterization of her name, her profession, and her lifelong habits (335).  Sporting ""two feverish spots of determination in her ordinarily colorless cheeks"" (333), she enters the feedstore where Jason IV works and where ""only men ever entered,"" and she speaks to him, despite having refused to do so for many years.

"22989","2835","Napoleon","Napoleon","","<p>Napoleon Bonaparte rose to prominence in France during the French Revolution.  In 1804 he proclaimed himself Emperor, and undertook to wage a series of wars in order to achieve dominion over Europe.

"22986","3312","Snopeses","Snopeses","","<p>There are more Snopeses in the fictions than any other family.  Over 60 named members of the family have their own entries in our database.  This entry represents the seven times when the fictions refer broadly or generically to ""the Snopeses"" - as a poor white family, as a way to measure the difference between the Old and New Souths, as a threat to the social order of a place like Jefferson, as the embodiment of the 20th century social evil that is often simply called ""Snopesism.""  It is important to note that many of those 60 named 'Snopeses' do not fit the profile of the stereotypical 'Snopes' that term evokes, but that didn't keep Faulkner from re-asserting the concept from the first Yoknapatawpha fiction to the last.</p>","Yes"
"22985","2832","Daniel Boone","Booner, Daniel","","<p>The ""Boon or Boone"" mentioned twice in the ""Appendix Compsons"" is most famous for exploring and settling what was then part of Virginia, and what is now Kentucky, creating a route through the Cumberland Gap in the Appalachian Mountains that many settlers would later follow.  The settlement referred to in the text is probably Boonesborough, one of the first settlements west of the Appalachians.  In the first mention Boone is portrayed as a peer of Quentin MacLachan Compson, simply ""a neighbor"" who had ""already established a settlement"" on the frontier (326), the second mention conjures up a larger-than-life figure who keeps company with Robinson Crusoe (330).</p>","No"

""Then"" is ""eighty years ago,"" and as the word ""lost"" suggests, the country he is talking about was the Confederacy; these forefathers fought <em>against</em> the United States.  (One of them would have been this Major's father, who was a Major in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.)  De Spain's unreconstructed attitude explains why he covers his son's coffin with ""the Confederate flag"" (107).</p>","Yes"

I knew them too: the men and women . . . still powerful and still dangerous and still coming, North and South and East and West"" (115).  The intent here is obviously to suggest a United States fully united and strong in the face of the external enemies they had to fight during World War II, but there is no indication in the text that the narrator, or Faulkner, includes the millions of non-white Americans who lived in the north and south and east and west in this entity, and so, although the ""deeds"" that created the country were accomplished by people of all races, our decision to identify this group as ""White"" seems the most accurate way to represent the text.</p>","No"

Although Tennessee did secede from the Union and join the Confederacy (the last state to do so), it was deeply divided between secessionists and Unionists.  The latter group probably did contain some ""tavern-keepers"" and certainly included ""Republican Abolitionists,"" but the harshness of Philip's description is due to his own allegiance to the secessionist cause.</p>","No"

Born a ""Backhouse"" - a familiar term for a privy or outhouse - he explains why he cannot change the name by telling Granny and Bayard that the Backhouses include men who fought in both the Revolutionary and Mexican Wars, and who ran for Governor of Tennessee.  The narrative presents him as both a genuinely heroic gentleman and a caricature of the typical hero of Civil War romances by authors not named Faulkner.  Philip thinks the only way to escape the curse of his name is to die nobly in battle, but Granny devises a plan that lets him do that - <em>and</em> marry ""that beautiful girl,"" Melisandre (678, etc. etc.).

Ike McCaslin, for example, sees slavery as an ""injustice"" (252), a ""horror and outrage"" (270), but also suggests that not every aspect of it was unjust; at one point he says that slaves were fed and cared for ""when they were sick"" by the (white) ""wives and daughters"" of their masters (271).</p>","Yes"

Old Carothers' sons Buck and Buddy, are reluctant to buy Tennie from Hubert Beauchamp because they ""had so many niggers already"" (7), but their reluctance extends to other aspects of slave-owning as well.   As soon as their father was buried, the two men moved out of the big house he was building into ""a oneroom log cabin which the two of them built themselves"" (248), and kept the slaves in the big house.

Ike most frequently refers to this divinity as ""He,"" always capitalizing the H (243, etc).  It must be clearly stated that by representing ""Him"" as an upper class white male, we are trying to capture <em>Ike</em>'s idea of ""God,"" not our own or anyone else's.   It is awkward to try representing ""God"" with any icon, but since Ike repeatedly mentions ""Him"" and the role ""He"" plays in historical events and what ""He"" said in ""the Book"" (243), we felt he had to be included in the novel's cast of Characters - as it seems to us that Ike imagines ""Him.""</p>","No"

When Percival is emancipated as a result of the McCaslins' frustrations with him, he refuses to leave the plantation.  He disappears during the Civil War, but reappears during Reconstruction as a preacher, ""leading the singing also in his high sweet true soprano voice,"" and again in the ""entourage"" of an Army paymaster (278).  He is repeatedly figured as effeminate, particularly as he leaves town with a ""defiant female glance"" (278).

After the Civil War he takes a black mistress for a while, and then lives with an aged black servant ""in one single room"" in the decaying mansion (290) until it burns down.

The locution is confusing, in part because ""his Uncle Hubert's sister"" is in fact Ike's mother, Sophonsiba, as one might expect him to acknowledge.

He died of tuberculosis at the young age of twenty-five, at which time he had only been a published poet for five years.  The poem in ""five stanzas"" from which (in ""Delta Autumn"") the father reads (293-94) - or (in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>) McCaslin Edmonds reads (282) - is not named in either of Faulkner's texts, but the two lines both texts quote make it easy to recognize as Keats' ""Ode on a Grecian Urn"" (293-94), one of Faulkner's own favorite poems.</p>","No"

It includes ""white men"" who own plantations and ""commute every night to Memphis,"" ""black men"" who own plantations and even towns and ""keep their town houses in Chicago,"" and is an amalgamation of ""Chinese and African and Aryan and Jew"" who ""breed"" together (279, 346).   This is one of the most racially, ethnically and socio-economically diverse groups in Faulkner's fiction, though it is safe to say that it reflects Ike's (and perhaps Faulkner's) fears more than any reality, in the Mississippi Delta or anywhere else in the broader U.S.</p>","No"

It is also ""the young[est] Negro"" who brings the young woman into the tent to talk with Ike McCaslin (277, 339).

At the start of the story she is referred to elliptically as the ""doe"" whom Boyd hunted the year before (268).  When she appears before Ike in person at the end of the story, she brings with her ""something intangible"" (277).  She is wearing a man's hat and rain coat, and has ""a face young"" with ""dark eyes"" (268).  She tells Ike she is a teacher.  She is obviously fair-skinned enough to pass as ""white,"" because it is not until she tells Ike that her aunt ""took in washing"" that he identifies that ""intangible something"" as her racial heritage as a Negro.  She expresses no shame or remorse about the affair or the child she carries in her arms; as she tells Ike, ""I knew what I was doing"" (277).  It seems clear that she loves Boyd, but is not surprised to learn he has abandoned her.  Ike endorses her decision to ""go back North,"" where she is originally from (178).

In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> this same woman is called his ""dead wife’s widowed niece"" near the end (335), but in the first mention of her, in the very beginning of the novel, she is ""his wife's sister"" and his ""sister-in-law"" (6).

He calls these men ""better men"" than ""Hitler"" and ""Pelley"" (in the story, 269) or ""Hitler,"" ""Roosevelt or Wilkie"" (in the novel, 322), but seems glad that ""they failed"" (269, 322).</p>","No"

The story reveals his ruthlessness in several ways, beginning with his driving and ending with his abandonment of the woman he had an affair with and the child they conceived together.  He seems to think money can settle his moral and emotional debts.  A veteran of the first World War, he is cynical about America and ""women and children"" (270), and violates both the game laws and Ike's hunting code when he shoots a female deer with a shotgun.

In the later story ""Shall Not Perish,"" the same narrator, a year older, refers to the country's enemy and the forces responsible for his brother's death as ""them Japs""  (101).

All her ""oldest brother"" tells Isham Quick is that they ""done already attended to"" him (106).  What he did as her husband, however, or if he was in fact her husband, or what they did to or for him - these questions remain unanswered.

The son was taken from him at three years of age, to grow up (badly) as a Thorpe, but to him the murdered man is still ""Jackson and Longstreet Fentry"" (100).</p>","Yes"

"22798","2657","Unnamed Great-Grandfather of Boy Hunter","Unnamed Great-Grandfather of Boy Hunter","","<p>Mentioned but not named in ""The Old People,"" the great-grandfather of the narrator was presumably one of the original planters in Yoknapatawpha, a contemporary of the first Sartorises and Compsons, but all the story definitely says about him is that ""almost a hundred years ago"" he bought the slaves from whom Sam Fathers is descended from Ikkemotubbe (203).</p>","Yes"

This is all the story says about that man, who is apparently now dead, but it is enough to establish his class pedigree: the manner in which he lived was that of the upper class in Yoknapatawpha.  (In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> the boy is Ike McCaslin and his grandfather is Carothers McCaslin, a man Ike has never seen but whose tainted legacy to his grandson leads Ike to choose to live in a very different manner, but in ""The Old People"" chapter of the novel Faulkner left in the phrases about the ""same country"" and the ""same manner,"" 157.)</p>","Yes"
"22796","2655","Unnamed Father of Boy Hunter","Unnamed Father of Boy Hunter","Unnamed Grandfather of Boy Hunter","<p>As Joseph Blotner points out, in a typescript for ""The Old People"" the father of the story's narrator is referred to as ""Mr Compson"" (presumably the Mr. Compson who is Benjy, Caddy, Quentin and Jason's father), but the character is given no name at all in this magazine version of the story.  All we can say with certainty about him is that he belongs to Yoknapatawpha's upper-class, owns a farm four miles from Jefferson and has an office in town.  He goes hunting every November with Major de Spain, Walter Ewell, Boon Hogganbeck and Uncle Ike McCaslin. When he was young, like his unnamed son, he was taught to hunt by Sam Fathers, and he tells his son that he also once had a mystical encounter while hunting with Sam.

As a tribe they have disappeared from the land, but a cherished part of the narrator's apprenticeship to Sam consists of the stories the old man tells him about this ""race,"" whom neither of them ""had ever known"" but who survive in the traditions that Sam passes on (204).  As ""the People,"" they seem much larger and more admirable than the individual Chickasaw Indians who are mentioned in the story.  As the boy puts it: ""Sam had marked me indeed with something he had had of his vanished and forgotten people"" and this mystical marking presumably enables the boy hunter to witness Fathers speaking to the majestic buck that Fathers hails as ""Grandfather"" (209, 210).</p>","Yes"

"22780","2643","Unnamed White Hunter","Unnamed White Hunter","","<p>When in <em>The Hamlet</em> Ratliff discovers a previously uncanvassed territory in Tennessee for selling sewing machines, either his imagination or the narrator's fetches a comparison from the other side of the world: Ratliff looks about him ""with something of the happy surmise of the first white hunter blundering into the idyllic solitude of a virgin African vale teeming with ivory"" (61).  It seems worth noting that this is one of the few times Faulkner's imagination visits Africa, and also that in this imagined event no Africans are present.</p>","Yes"

"22777","2640","Unnamed Two Officers","Unnamed Two Officers","","<p>The ""two officers"" mentioned in <em>The Hamlet</em> as accompanying Mink in his courtroom appearances are probably deputy sheriffs, but the novel uses the term ""officers"" to name them (287, 367).</p>","Yes"

According to the narrator, these boys and girls walk ""back and forth in all weathers"" (108) to the community schoolhouse. Many of these schoolchildren have no use for the institution at all, especially for their alcoholic professor.

Neither her first nor her married name is mentioned.

"22768","2631","Unnamed Sawmill Owners and Workers","Unnamed Sawmill Owners and Workers","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> these ""people"" are obliquely evoked when the narrator says that the ""mounds of rotting sawdust"" marking the sites of the sawmills that once turned all the trees around Frenchman's Bend into lumber are the ""monuments of a people's heedless greed"" (190).</p>","Yes"
"22767","2630","Unnamed Remote Kinswoman","Unnamed Remote Kinswoman","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> the orphaned Lucy Pate was raised by this remote relation; she imbued Lucy with the ""domestic skill"" of a ""country heritage"" and the values of ""constancy and devotion"" (227).</p>","Yes"
"22766","2629","Unnamed Relatives of Lump Snopes","Unnamed Relatives of Lump Snopes","","<p>Lump Snopes' mother in <em>The Hamlet</em> was one ""of a moil of sisters and brothers"" (218).  'Moil' is an archaic term that can mean 'confusion,' so the sense of this is that she was one of many children; this reading is confirmed when the narrator notes that her father was ""a congenital failure"" who ""begot . . . more  children whom he could not quite feed"" (218).</p>","Yes"
"22765","2628","Unnamed Quadroon","Unnamed Quadroon","","<p>The owner of the logging camp where Mink works in <em>The Hamlet</em> ""lives openly"" with a quadroon woman ""most of whose teeth were gold"" and who superintends the kitchen (262).  (The term 'quadroon' appears in a lot of American literature before the Civil Rights movement; it was used to label a person with three white and one black grandparents.  Faulkner scholarship uses the term to identify the woman in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> with whom Charles Bon has a child, but we identify her in this index as Mrs. Charles Bon.)</p>","No"

"22763","2626","Unnamed People Traveling in Wagons","Unnamed People Traveling in Wagons","","<p>Like a number of crowds or groups of people in <em>The Hamlet</em>, the folks who ride various wagons on various roads in and around Frenchman's Bend cannot be individualized or broken up into smaller groups. At one point this set includes Flem Snopes, when along with many other people in wagons he pauses the wagon carrying his belongings to Jefferson to watch Henry Armstid digging up the garden of the Old Frenchman place, but as a set of characters the people moving along the country roads are too dynamic and variable, for they together - up to ""four generations"" (404) of men, women and children - constitute a complex interrelation of trade, labor, and migration that is ongoing.</p>","Yes"

"22754","2617","Unnamed Negro Shooting Victim","Unnamed Negro Shooting Victim","","<p>At a ""bleak"" train station he is passing through in <em>The Hamlet</em>, Labove witnesses a white man shooting this ""negro"" (138).

"22748","2611","Unnamed Negro Field Hand","Unnamed Negro Field Hand","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> Ratliff's revulsion at the idea of Eula Varner being married to Flem Snopes leads him to imagine what Flem's idea of sex is; the result is a disturbing image that probably tells us more about Ratliff than about Flem or anyone else: sex as a kind of business transaction with a ""black brute from the field with the field sweat still drying on her"" (181) who wants ""a nickel's worth of lard"" from the store (180).</p>","Yes"
"22747","2610","Unnamed Negro Farmhand 1","Unnamed Negro Farmhand 1","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> this farmhand buys the buggy that was used by one of Eula's suitors and drives it through the village ""a few times each year"" (165).</p>","Yes"

"22745","2608","Unnamed Negro Companion","Unnamed Negro Companion","","<p>This young black was Hoake McCarron's sole companion growing up. Many of Faulkner's wealthier white men had Negro companions and personal servants as boys; the way this kind of relationship plays out in <em>The Hamlet</em> is atypical, to say the least.  When the boys are 6-8 years old, Hoake ""conquers the negro with his fists in a fair fight"" (150).  Later he ""pays the negro"" at a fixed rate ""for the privilege of whipping [him] . . . with a miniature riding crop"" (151).  While the narrative takes note that the whippings are ""not severely"" administered (151), it's hard to understand how Faulkner wants us to evaluate Hoake - who as Eula Varner's first lover and the father of Linda Snopes plays a significant role in the trilogy - in view of this detail in his biography.</p>","No"

"22743","2606","Unnamed Mother of Will Varner","Unnamed Mother of Will Varner","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> Will Varner mentions that his ""mammy"" once heard an old woman explain that the way a pregnant woman can make sure she has a girl is to ""show her belly to the full moon"" (339).  ""Mammy"" often implies a black woman, but in this case it seems more likely that Will is talking about his own mother.  (The word occurs in a passage thick with his rural vernacular: ""I mind me when"" ""done married and moved,"" ""passel of boys,"" etc.; 339.)</p>","Yes"
"22742","2605","Unnamed Merchant|Installment People","Unnamed Merchant|Installment People","","<p>This is ""the merchant"" in <em>The Hamlet</em> from whom Houston bought furniture on an installment plan for his new life with his new wife - though the character is unstable: a paragraph later the narrative refers to ""the installment people"" who don't want ""to take the furniture back,"" as Houston requests, after that new wife dies (239).  Presumably the merchant and the people are essentially the same.</p>","Yes"
"22741","2604","Unnamed Men of Frenchman's Bend","Unnamed Men of Frenchman's Bend","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> there are always groups of men hanging around Frenchman's Bend's more public spaces, like Varner's various businesses or Mrs. Littlejohn's boarding house. Some members appear somewhat individualized, such as with the ""man with the peach spray"" (343) who discusses the horse auction and its consequences with a ""second"" and a ""third"" among the group at Varner's store, although each remains virtually indistinct, members of a communal group who interact with well-defined characters like Varner, Ratliff, Quick, Bookwright, Freeman and the various Snopeses. While not entirely made up of men, the crowd that attends the horse auction is included in this entry.  Increasing in size from ""six men"" in Mrs. Littlejohn's lane (308) to ""more than fifty men now standing along the fence beside the gate"" of the lot (314), this crowd comes from all around the Bend to watch and perhaps participate in the sale of the wild Texas ponies.  Some of these men speak, although they are described simply as ""one of the others"" or ""a second,"" ""third,"" or ""newcomer"" without individual characteristics.  The ""purchasers"" of the horses become a kind of subset of the larger group at the end of the auction: ""gathering as though by instinct into a separate group"" (323).</p>","Yes"

In the Ike Snopes' narrative, Faulkner refers to them as ""last night's new drummer-faces"" - i.e. traveling salesmen who are staying for one night (182). While they can be classified as a group, these individuals are constantly coming and going, staying in Frenchman's Bend for variable amounts of time.  Typically <em>only</em> men stay in Yoknapatawpha boarding houses, but in this case we know that Mrs. Armstid stays at Littlejohn's while her husband recovers.</p>","Yes"

"22717","2581","Unnamed Galveston Brothel Madam","Unnamed Galveston Brothel Madam","","<p>This is the woman whom <em>The Hamlet</em> refers to as the ""curl-papered landlady"" in El Paso who tries to prevent Jack Houston from taking the woman who becomes his common law wife away from her house - but since the woman is a prostitute and the place the landlady runs is a brothel, it seems clear that ""landlady"" is a euphemism for 'madam' (234).</p>","No"
"22716","2580","Unnamed Frenchman's Bend Family","Unnamed Frenchman's Bend Family","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> Flem boards with this family, who live ""about a mile from the store,"" after securing his position at Varner's (64).</p>","Yes"

"22711","2575","Unnamed Federal Officers","Unnamed Federal Officers","","<p>These ""federal officers"" would usually be called 'revenuers' (5).  According to <em>The Hamlet</em>, as the Old Frenchman's original plantation falls into decay after the Civil War, the area that becomes known as Frenchman's Bend transforms into an enclosed back country effectively outside the reach of government authorities. From time to time, ""federal officers"" (who would have come to Bend trying to enforce the laws against making moonshine) go ""into the country and vanish,"" though with a trace: after their disappearance their clothing and possessions are sometimes seen on a local ""child or old man or woman"" (5).</p>","Yes"
"22710","2574","Unnamed Father-in-Law of Mink Snopes","Unnamed Father-in-Law of Mink Snopes","","<p>The father of the woman who marries Mink Snopes in <em>The Hamlet</em> is a ""roaring man of about fifty""; he's a widower who has a ""magnificent quadroon mistress"" and the owner of timber land that he harvests using unpaid convict labor that he acquires ""through political influence or bribery or whatever"" from the state of Mississippi (262).</p>","No"
"22709","2573","Unnamed Father-in-Law of Eck Snopes","Unnamed Father-in-Law of Eck Snopes","","<p>The father of Eck Snopes' first wife is unnamed, despite the fact that his ""name"" figures in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  This needs explaining, and the text does try to do that.  Eck's (also unnamed) wife dies sometime after the child is born, and her mother, according to Eck, began calling him ""after his grandpa"" - that is, presumably, her husband (295).  But (as Eck 'explains') ""he never had no actual name,"" and we never learn what his grandmother called him (295).

"22708","2572","Unnamed Father of Vynie Snopes","Unnamed Father of Vynie Snopes","","<p>The father of Vynie Snopes in <em>The Hamlet</em>. He has never approved of her marriage to Ab Snopes. According to Ratliff, one day he ""druv up in a wagon and loaded her and the furniture into it and told Ab"" if he ever came back into Vynie's life, ""he would shoot him"" (33-34).</p>","Yes"
"22707","2571","Unnamed Father of Buggy Driver","Unnamed Father of Buggy Driver","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> the father of one of the young men in Frenchman's Bend who courted Eula before her marriage eventually sells his son's neglected buggy to a ""negro farm-hand"" (165).</p>","Yes"
"22706","2570","Unnamed College Professors 3","Unnamed College Professors 3","","<p>These ""five different faculty members"" at the University of Mississippi are mentioned in <em>The Hamlet</em> as part of Labove's story: one of his jobs while studying there is building fires in their homes each morning (120).

"22703","2567","Unnamed Drover","Unnamed Drover","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> this drover tells Alison Hoake McCarron of her husband's death (150).  A ""drover"" is someone who drives herds of cattle, from pasture to pasture or from farm to market, and so on.</p>","Yes"
"22702","2566","Unnamed Wagon Driver 4","Unnamed Wagon Driver 4","","<p>This ""driver"" who passes Ike Snopes on the side of the road in <em>The Hamlet</em> knows Ike well enough to call him by ""his name,"" but is not otherwise described (197).</p>","Yes"

That could mean they are servants, though it seems more likely that, like Ab Snopes, they are tenant farmers working other pieces of land at De Spain's.</p>","Yes"
"22699","2563","Unnamed Servants of the Prince of Darkness","Unnamed Servants of the Prince of Darkness","","<p>In the fantasy of Flem in hell in <em>The Hamlet</em>, these minions - the text refers to them only as ""they"" and ""them"" (166) - carry messages between their master and Snopes.  One of them is individualized as an ""old fellow"" who ""used to dandle the Prince on his knee when the Prince was a boy"" (168), but none of them are described.  The dialect in which they speak is one that is conventionally associated with the lower class and the rural south: Flem's soul, they say, ""wasn't no big one to begin with nohow"" (166).</p>","No"
"22698","2562","Unnamed Customers at the Savoy Hotel","Unnamed Customers at the Savoy Hotel","","<p>The men who stay at the Savoy Hotel where Mink's wife works in <em>The Hamlet</em> are described as horse-traders, jurors and insurance agents who sell to Negroes, a clientele that justifies the place's ""equivocal reputation"" (288).

"22694","2558","Unnamed Courthouse Janitor","Unnamed Courthouse Janitor","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> it is the courthouse janitor who ""opens the court-room"" for Mink Snopes' trial and, according to the narrator, could have done as good a job defending Mink his court-appointed lawyer (367).</p>","Yes"
"22693","2557","Unnamed County Officers","Unnamed County Officers","","<p>According to the narrator of <em>The Hamlet</em>, ""county officers do not bother [the people of Frenchman's Bend] at all save in the heel of election years"" (5).  The reference is to 'peace officers,' i.e. policemen, though in Yoknapatawpha the term 'police' is rarely used to describe the county's sheriffs and deputies or the marshals in the town.  The county sheriffs all are elected, which explains the last part of that quotation, but in fact the novel shows them doing their job in Frenchman's Bend, at least when Houston is murdered.</p>","Yes"

"22687","2551","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha during Civil War","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha during Civil War","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> Ratliff imagines how the people living in or near the Frenchman's house are drawn into the events of their time. Thus, Faulkner depicts the wealth of the antebellum plantation with the news of Sumter reaching ""women swaying and pliant in hooped crinoline beneath parasols"" and ""the men in broadcloth riding the good horses"" (373). During the first three years of the Civil War, this group is comprised virtually of women, since the men have left to fight.

"22679","2543","Unnamed ""Boys"" of Frenchman's Bend","Unnamed ""Boys"" of Frenchman's Bend","","<p>This is the group in <em>The Hamlet</em> whom Lump Snopes refers to as ""a few of the boys"" (258).  They don't appear directly in the narrative, but Lump tells Mink his plan to take these young white men one night to the home of the Negro who found Mink's shotgun, and terrify him ""with a couple of trace chains or maybe a little fire under his feet"" in order to force him to admit, falsely, that he stole the gun (258).</p>","Yes"

"22677","2541","Sam","Sam","","<p>Although the narrator of <em>The Hamlet</em> calls the Varner's cook the ""only servant of any sort in the whole district"" (11), the Varner's also have a manservant.  Among his jobs is carrying Eula ""until she was five or six"": ""the negro man staggering slightly beneath his long, dangling, already indisputably female burden"" (106).</p>","Yes"
"22676","2540","Rideout, Brother of Aaron","Rideout, Brother of Aaron","","<p>At the end of <em>The Hamlet</em> among the men watching Flem's wagon heading out from Varner's store toward Jefferson and speculating on what Flem's next move will be is a man who is identified only as Aaron Rideout's brother and also V.K.

"22673","2537","Prince of Darkness, Father of","Prince of Darkness, Father of","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> Faulkner's imagination takes one of its most amazing flights (or perhaps descents) when he describes Flem Snopes meeting the fallen angels in Hell.

"22672","2536","Old Frenchman, Son of","Grenier, Son of Louis","Louis Grenier","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> the Old Frenchman's son has disappeared from the scene along with the rest of his family, except for a single detail:  this heir to the Old Frenchman plantation - possibly accompanied by his father - rode into Jefferson in the early days of the Civil War to recruit men to the Confederate army (373).</p>","Yes"
"22671","2535","Old Frenchman, Family of","Grenier Family","","<p>The Frenchman's Bend planter who appears in <em>The Hamlet</em> is elsewhere identified as Louis Grenier.  His family is distinguished by the way it has disappeared completely in the years after the South lost the Civil War: ""he was gone now, . . . the Frenchman, with his family"" (4).  In one scene late in the novel the life of the white ladies and gentlemen on the old plantation is conjured up, but there too the novel notes that ""there is nothing to show of that now"" (373).

"22666","2530","Labove","Labove","Labove, Father of Labove","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> Labove is the child of a poor family in ""the next county"" (114).  After working his way through the University of Mississippi doing menial jobs and playing football, he is hired to be the schoolmaster in Frenchman's Bend. Faulkner initially describes him as ""gaunt, with straight black hair coarse as a horse's tail and high Indian cheekbones and quiet pale hard eyes and the long nose of thought but with the slightly curved nostrils of pride and the thin lips of secret and ruthless ambition"" (117). He possesses ""a forensic face,"" moreover, ""the face of invincible conviction in the power of words as a principle worth dying for if necessary."" Labove is above all a misanthrope, a man who would in past ages have been a monk, ""a militant fanatic"" ready to turn his ""uncompromising back upon the world"" (117).

The word ""city"" in that description suggests she is from Memphis, or someplace similar, but that is not made clear in the story.  Nor can we say for sure that she <em>is</em> Monk's mother, though the fact that the infant Monk is seen at the Odlethrops' shortly after she and the son leave - for unknown reasons, though perhaps because Mrs. Odlethrop drives them ""out of the house and out of the country"" at gunpoint (44) - makes that probable.  What the narrative does make clear about her is that ""hardness"" that, like ""city,"" is emphasized in the description: her expression is ""cold and sullen and unseeing,"" and ""deadly, too"" (43).</p>","Yes"

He convinces Monk to kill the Warden.  He seems to serve as a foil for Monk - Terrel owns a gas station, and Monk works at one; he yearns for a pardon, and Monk refuses one; he trusts no one, and Monk trusts everyone.

"22613","2479","Monk Odlethrop","Odlethrop, Monk","Unnamed Mother of Monk, Odlethrop","<p>In ""Monk,"" the mentally challenged title character is a mystery.  Initially known only as ""Monk,""  the narrator characterizes him as a ""moron, perhaps even a cretin"" (41), using terms offensive to modern readers but common and acceptable during the era of the story's composition.  Near the end readers learn that his given name is actually Stonewall Jackson Odlethrop - though it is not clear exactly who gave him any of these names.  He is born in the hill country east of Jefferson, presumably the unwanted child of Mrs. Odelethrop's son and a ""hard"" woman from somewhere else (43).  These parents abandon him, and he lives for ""six or seven years"" with his grandmother (44) and then for ""ten years"" with a moonshiner named Fraser (45).  According to the narrator, ""all"" Monk ever ""learns"" to do is ""make and sell whiskey"" (45), and ""pump"" gas and ""make correct change"" (46).  He begins coming into town when he is ""about twenty-five"" - ""pleasant, impervious to affront, talkative when anyone would listen"" (46).   The narrative's one explicit description of Monk's mental deficiencies is a reference to the ""curious quality of imperfect connection between sense and ratiocination"" (46).  He is convicted twice for two different killings, one of which he is framed for, but one of which he clearly commits.  Yet through it all he retains a kind of innocence and helplessness that appeals to Gavin Stevens' sense of chivalry and perhaps the reader's sympathy.  Stevens can solve part of the mystery of Monk's life and death, but the story leaves unresolved the complex problems of a society and legal system that fail to protect such a fragile individual.</p>","Yes"
"22612","2478","Odlethrop","Odlethrop","","<p>The man who is Mrs. Odlethrop's son in ""Monk"" and also, presumably, the title character's biological father, is described as ""too much even for that country and people"" (43).  He returns to his mother's home with a woman, presumably Monk's mother, after a ten year absence.  He initially left (or was driven out of Yoknapatawpha) after killing someone, and after his return his own mother is said to have ""driven"" him out of town again at gunpoint (43).</p>","Yes"

He makes Monk a ""trusty"" (trustee, 49), and Monk follows him with ""doglike devotion"" (49).  However, he also displays a cruel streak when he goads Bill Terrel concerning his pardon.  He shows his judgment to be even more questionable when he has an unnamed Negro cook ""severely beaten"" in an effort to extract information about his missing pistol.  Monk later finds the pistol where the warden then ""recalls having hid it himself"" (53).</p>","No"

"22606","2472","Unnamed Imported Slaves of Sutpen","Unnamed Imported Slaves of Sutpen","","<p>In <em>Absalom!</em> these are the twenty ""wild blacks"" whom Sutpen brings as slaves to Yoknaptawpha in 1833 (4), from a French colony in the Caribbean; the ""civilized language"" which they speak (44) is ""a sort of French"" (27).  Sutpen has a child - Clytemnestra - with one of the two slaves in this group who are women (48).  The narrative repeatedly calls them ""wild"" (13, 16, etc.), and distinguishes them as a group from the ""tame"" slaves that Sutpen later acquires, through birth or purchase (17).  Rosa characterizes them as being ""like beasts half tamed to walk upright like men"" (4).  When Mr. Compson passes on to his son the story he heard from his father about using these slaves to track the runaway architect through the woods, he speculates that they may be cannibals expecting to eat their prey (206).  Working with Sutpen, they build his huge mansion.  For the entertainment of a white male audience, at least several of them wrestle with each other and with Sutpen - according to Rosa, ""fighting not like white men fight . . . but like negroes"" (20).  During the Civil War, like ""all of Sutpen's negroes,"" they self-emancipate by ""following the Yankee troops away"" (67).  When <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> refers back to this original group, it identifies them as ""thirty-odd men slaves"" who are ""even wilder and more equivocal than the native wild men"" - i.e. the Indians (30).  They speak the ""Carib-Spanish-French of the Sugar Islands"" - i.e. the Caribbean (30).

Sutpen's ""house servants,"" like nearly all the servants in Faulkner's world, are black, and during the Civil War many Confederate officers took slaves with them to the war, but these are called ""body servants"" in the fictions, and explicitly racialized as black.

The Chronology at the end of the novel treats her mixed racial identity as a fact - ""Sutpen learns his wife has negro blood"" (305) - but the actual novel does not independently confirm it.

Compson brings champagne, ""and some of the others brought whiskey"" (178).  They are wealthy enough to ride horses.  In Sutpen's mind, these men will expect him to track the man with dogs (178).  The narrative does not provide access to their thoughts; presumably many are the same men who come to Sutpen's Hundred to hunt game animals, but their apparent familiarity with the ritual of hunting a person may imply their previous experience of pursuing runaway slaves - although no scene of chasing a runaway slave appears in the novel.

""Decoration Day"" is better known as ""Confederate Memorial Day,"" out of which the U.S. Memorial Day holiday eventually came.

Indian agents represented the U.S. government in its interactions with indigenous people.  Since a primary job of the agent is to ensure that land sales concerning Native Americans are recorded and licensed, Jason Compson I's receipt of a square mile of land from Ikkemotubbe is likely made all the easier by his becoming first clerk for and then partner with the Chickasaw Agent in Jefferson (328).</p>","Yes"
"22548","2418","Unnamed Indian Agent 1","Unnamed Indian Agent 1","","<p>In <em>Absalom!</em> Sutpen negotiates his acquisition of land ""with or through"" the ""Chickasaw Indian agent"" (25).

"22535","2405","Unnamed Enslaved House Negroes","Unnamed Enslaved House Negroes","","<p>Conventionally, the enslaved people in the antebellum South were divided into two categories: 'field Negroes,' who had little contact with whites other than overseers, and 'house Negroes,' who worked indoors as cooks, maids, butlers, and so on. In <em>Absalom!</em>, Jefferson's ""house negroes"" first appear accompanying the white ""ladies and children"" to church services, carrying the ""parasols and flywhisks"" that keep the sun and insects away from the whites (23).

"22532","2402","Unnamed Enslaved Haitians","Unnamed Enslaved Haitians","","<p>Historically, Haitian slavery was abolished and French ownership of land forbidden by law before Sutpen was born.  <em>Absalom!</em> represents the people who rise up against the rule of the French sugar planter so symbolically that it is impossible to know if it sees them as enslaved or not, though it's likely that in Faulkner's mind their uprising is a slave rebellion.  Before the rebellion they are depicted as the unseen sound of ""the drums and the chanting"" at night (202), and a ""blank wall of black secret faces, a wall behind which almost anything could be preparing to happen"" (203).  They speak in the novel through voodoo tokens - ""a pig's bone with a little rotten flesh still clinging to it, a few chicken bones,"" etc. (203).

After Sutpen's death, when Judith runs the store, the clientele is feminized: ""women and children with pails and baskets"" (152).  (""White trash"" is a demeaning term for poor whites.  It is noteworthy that Shreve has not heard it growing up in Canada; on the other hand, as his comment above shows, he is quite familiar with the demeaning term for African Americans and uses it throughout his sections in the text.)</p>","Yes"

"22516","2386","Unnamed Confederate Generals","Unnamed Confederate Generals","","<p>Several real Confederate officers are mentioned by name in <em>Absalom!</em>.  They have their own entries.  This entry represents the larger, anonymous group of men who lead the Confederate Army through the Civil War.  Like so many other characters in the novel, they are seen differently from different points of view.  In Chapter 1, to Rosa Coldfield, who writes ""poems, ode eulogy and epitaph"" to many of them, they are ""a few figures with the shapes of men but with the names and statures of heroes"" (13).  In Chapter 7, Wash Jones thinks of these men who ""set the order and the rule of living"" as both ""symbol of admiration and hope"" and ""instruments of despair and grief"" (232).  And in Chapter 8 they are summed up (by someone, though it's not clear if it's the 3rd-person narrator or Quentin or Shreve or Quentin-and-Shreve) as ""generals who should not have been generals,"" men whose rank was ""conferred on them by an absolute caste system"" rather than any fitness for leadership (276).</p>","No"

"22512","2382","Unnamed ""Half-Breed"" Servants 2","Unnamed ""Half-Breed"" Servants 2","","<p>This is the second of the two sets of ""half-breed servants"" on the Haitian plantation in <em>Absalom!</em> (199).  ""Half-breed"" is an unusual term in this context: in white-authored American literature the term 'half-breed' is more often applied to people with one Indian and one European parent; presumably here it means a mixed white and black ancestry - whom Faulkner usually refers to as 'mulatto.'  And the novel's references to ""half-breeds""are contradictory: it says ""all the servants, the half breeds, were missing"" on the eve of the rebellion (203), and also that two ""frightened half-breed servants"" remained to assist in the defense of the plantation house (199).

They help load the muskets with which Sutpen and the planter try to defend the house.

"22506","2376","Rosa Coldfield","Coldfield, Rosa","Goodhue Coldfield, Mrs. Coldfield 2","<p>Of all the storytellers in <em>Absalom!</em>, Rosa Coldfield is the one with the most firsthand knowledge of the Sutpen family.  She is Ellen's sister, Judith and Henry's aunt, and was even, for a few weeks right after the Civil War, Thomas' fiancee - until he spoke the words that caused her to begin wearing the ""eternal black which she had worn for forty-three years"" when the novel opens (3).  And it is her version of the story, of Sutpen in particular, that is expressed first.  As a character she is vividly described: Quentin pictures her as a ""little girl, in the prim skirts and pantalettes, the smooth prim decorous braids, of the dead time"" before the War (14-15), and in 1909 she remains ""small"" and ""slight,"" an old woman with ""lace at wrists and throat"" (4) ""whose feet, even when she would be grown, would never quite reach the floor even from her own chairs"" (51), living as a penniless spinster in the house she grew up in, never leaving home after sundown ""save on Sundays and Wednesdays for prayer meeting"" (70).  As the ""county's poetess laureate"" she wrote ""a thousand and more"" ""odes to Southern soldiers"" (65) even as her father starved himself to death in protest against the war.  No examples of her poetry are given, but her prose narrative of Sutpen, Bon and the others is couched in the melodramatic terms of fairy tales or morality plays, with Sutpen cast as the ""demon"" outsider (4) who destroys an Old South she imagines as edenic, or at least locates in a ""garden"" (115).  When Mr. Compson takes up the narrative next, one of his first acts is to impeach her version of the story, and when the narrative is re-started in a Harvard dorm room, Shreve mocks her and her preconceptions by referring frequently to ""Aunt Rosa"" and ""the demon"" (143, 145).  As the third-person narrator notes still later, however, the ""best of ratiocination"" is ""after all a good deal like . . . Miss Coldfield's demonising"" (225).  As with the other storytellers, it is important for readers to decide for themselves how much her version reveals about the story, and how much it says about herself.</p>","Yes"
"22505","2375","Mrs. Coldfield 1","Coldfield, Mrs. 1","","<p>Goodhue Coldfield's mother is an elusive character. <em>Absalom!</em> several times asserts that Rosa Coldfield's childhood was spent in a household consisting of her father and her aunt, but in one passage it refers to the fact that Mr. Coldfield had to support ""a dependent mother"" as well as his family (32).</p>","Yes"
"22504","2374","Coldfield, Grandfather of Goodhue","Coldfield, Grandfather of Goodhue","","<p>Goodhue Coldfield's grandfather never appears in <em>Absalom!</em>, but Rosa distinguishes herself and her origins from Sutpen by noting that her father knew ""who his grandfather had been in Virginia"" (11).</p>","No"
"22503","2373","Coldfield, Father of Goodhue","Coldfield, Father of Goodhue","Coldfield, Grandfather of Goodhue","<p>Goodhue Coldfield's father never appears in <em>Absalom!</em>, but Rosa distinguishes herself and her origins from Sutpen's parvenu status by noting that ""our father knew who his father was in Tennessee"" (11).</p>","No"
"22502","2372","Unnamed Aunt of Rosa Coldfield","Unnamed Aunt of Rosa Coldfield","","<p>In <em>Absalom!</em>, Rosa's ""spinster aunt"" (46) lives with the Coldfields in Jefferson and, after Rosa's mother dies, raises the girl.  According to Mr. Compson, this aunt is ""that strong vindictive consistent woman who seems to have been twice the man that Mr. Coldfield was and who in very truth was not only Miss Rosa's mother but her father too"" (49).  ""A virgin at thirty-five,"" when Rosa is born, she brings Rosa up in a ""closed masonry of females,"" defined by rage against ""the entire male principle"" in general and Thomas Sutpen in particular - at least according to Mr. Compson (46, 47).  But the novel does not encourage readers uncritically to accept Mr. Compson's representation; only one page after he defines her as consistently vindictive, readers learn that when Rosa was still a child, ""the aunt climbed out the window and vanished"" (50).  She ""elopes with a horse- and mule-trader"" (59), and apparently is last seen during the Civil War trying to ""pass the Yankee lines"" in order to be near her captured ""husband"" (66).</p>","Yes"
"22501","2371","Wilde","Wilde, Oscar","","<p>According to Mr. Compson, the scene in <em>Absalom!</em> in the Sutpen graveyard with Bon's wife and child ""must have resembled a garden scene by the Irish poet, Wilde"" (157).  Wilde - who died in 1900, nine years before Mr. Compson would have said this - wrote in many genres, but in particular his poetry was an important influence on the apprentice work of William Faulkner.</p>","No"
"22500","2370","Aubrey Beardsley","Beardsley, Aubrey","","<p>In <em>Absalom!</em> Mr. Compson imagines Bon's wife as someone ""Beardsley might have dressed"" and Bon's child as a figure ""Beardsley might not only have dressed but drawn"" (157).  Like Oscar Wilde, mentioned in the same passage, Aubrey Beardsley was an important artist in late 19th century England.  His decadent visual style was an important influence on the early drawings of William Faulkner.  Beardsley's name is also mentioned in <em>Light in August</em>.</p>","No"

"22498","2368","Abraham","Abraham","","<p>The ""old Abraham full of years"" to whom Shreve compares Sutpen in <em>Absalom!</em> is obviously the Old Testament patriarch (260). That figure is best known as the mythic father of the covenant between God and His chosen people, and as the human father whose faith was so great that he was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac in obedience to God's command. Shreve's ""Abraham,"" however, seems entirely his own invention, who - in a quotation that sounds biblical but that Shreve makes up - ""raised about me sons to bear the burden of mine iniquities and persecutions"" (260).</p>","No"
"22497","2367","Major Beat Four Families","Major Beat Four Families","","<p><em>Intruder in the Dust</em> refers often to both the extended Gowrie clan and the larger white population of Beat Four as a specific sociological entity.  The phrase ""Gowries and Ingrums and Workitts"" identifies the three largest familial groups in that area of Yoknapatawpha (28), though members of these families have intermarried repeatedly over the generations too.  (Twice the novel adds ""Frasers"" to this list of names, 145, 146; another time it adds ""McCallums,"" 33).  All these families share a common origin in the Scottish highlands - ""Ingrum used to be Ingraham and Workitt used to be Urquhart"" before their ancestors came to America (145) - which helps explain why they chose to live in the hilliest part of the county.  The narrator sums them up as ""a connection of brawlers and farmers and foxhunters and stock- and timber-traders"" as well as ""whiskeymakers"" who are known for their racism, violence, group loyalty and resistance to outsiders (35).  The rest of the county expects ""them Beat Four folks"" to waste no time lynching the black man accused of shooting one of them in the back (46).</p>","Yes"
"22496","2366","Major Frenchman's Bend Families","Major Frenchman's Bend Families","","<p>In the last decades of his career Faulkner several times creates lists of the major family names in various parts of Yoknapatawpha.  In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> he identifies five family names with Frenchman's Bend and its environs: Littlejohn and Greenleaf and Armstead and Millingham and Bookwright (146).  There is a Confederate General named Armstead mentioned in the novel, but his name is actually 'Armistead' and he's from North Carolina; members of the <em>Armstid</em> family appear in 9 other Yoknapatawpha fictions, and presumably that is the name Faulkner meant to use on this list.</p>","Yes"
"22495","2365","Major Yoknapatawpha Families","Major Yoknapatawpha Families","","<p>In the last decades of his career Faulkner several times includes lists of what, in ""Appendix Compson,"" he identifies as ""the oldest names in the county"" (330) - or, as it puts it more grandiloquently in <em>The Town</em>, the ""cognomens long and splendid in the annals of Yoknapatawpha County"" (284).  Here they are, organized chronologically by publication dates:<br />
As listed in ""Appendix Compson"" - Holston and Sutpen, Grenier and Beauchamp and Coldfield (330), Compsons and Sartorises and their ilk (338);<br />

"22494","2364","Unnamed Neighbor Men","Unnamed Neighbor Men","","<p>In ""Fool about a Horse"" and again in <em>The Hamlet</em>, these ""neighbor men"" are in the habit of dropping by to see what kind of horse Pap (in the short story) or Ab Snopes (in the novel) has ""brung home this time"" (119) - or ""whatever it was he had done swapped for"" (34).  It's likely that at least most of these men are tenant farmers on the Holland land too.</p>","Yes"
"22493","2363","Unnamed Listeners to ""Fool about a Horse""","Unnamed Listeners to ""Fool about a Horse""","","<p>Although it's a printed text, ""Fool About a Horse"" provides a lot of evidence that the narrator is <em>telling</em> rather than writing it, that Faulkner intends us to imagine it as an oral tale being performed for a live audience.  Twice the narrator refers to ""you,"" for example (123, 132), and at another point addresses his audience as ""gentlemen"" (128); the story's repeated use of the locutions ""Yes, sir"" and ""No, sir"" also suggests the dynamic of live performance (118, etc.).  However, the text gives no indication of where the story is being told, or specifically to whom, but we follow the example of many other moments in the Yoknapatawpha fictions by speculating that it is being told to a group of country men gathered on the front porch of Varner's store.  (In the earliest manuscript version of the story, however, the story-teller is named V.K. Suratt and is telling it to a few real ""gentlemen"" - a doctor and a Confederate General - in an office in Jefferson.  And when Faulkner revised the tale for inclusion in <em>The Hamlet</em>, it is told by V.K. Ratliff to Will Varner himself, while they sit together on a different porch.)</p>","Yes"
"22492","2362","Unnamed Narrator 9","Unnamed Narrator 9","","<p>One of many of Faulkner's ""boy"" narrators, this twelve-year-old son of tenant farmers is more probably an adult when he tells this story about how Pat Stamper bested both his ""Pap"" and ""Mammy.""  Although he is a sympathetic companion to his father, he is also a careful reporter and analyst of Pap's behavior.  At least from his older perspective, he can see Pap's weaknesses for horse- and mule-trading, and for alcohol as well. He tells this story in a vernacular dialect that is often eloquent, though also characterized by the racist language and biases he has learned from his surroundings.</p>","Yes"
"22491","2361","Vynie","Vynie","","<p>The woman whom the narrator of ""Fool about a Horse"" calls ""Mammy"" is named ""Vynie."" She works hard and frugally to contribute to her family's farm income, so she is resentful, suspicious, and caustic about her husband's misadventures in horse-trading.  When his foolishness results in the loss of the milk separator she wanted, she cries for the first time in her son's experience.  Still resolute, she goes off alone to recover the separator, but in the end she is as big a fool about that machine as her husband is about the horse.  (When Faulkner interpolated a revised version of this story into <em>The Hamlet</em>, this ""Vynie"" became ""Vynie Snopes,"" Ab's first wife.)</p>","Yes"

The next day some ""people from Hoke's"" (189), called ""sawmill men from Hoke's"" in the novel (224), show up at the hunting camp, to participate in the hunt for Old Ben.

"22473","2350","Jake Kilrain","Kilrain, Jake","","<p>Born John Joseph Killion in Greenpoint, New York, he took the professional name of ""Jake Kilrain"" to protect his parents from the embarrassment of his questionable career as a prize fighter.  He lost the heavy-weight championship to John L. Sullivan in a bare-knuckle fight that went 75 rounds in Richbourg, Mississippi, on August 7, 1889.  His name is mentioned in ""Lion"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> as a way to describe how the hunters in Yoknapatawpha feel about their sport: ""Boon and the conductor and the brakeman talked about Lion and Old Ben as people talked about Sullivan and Kilrain or Dempsey and Tunney"" (187, 218).</p>","No"
"22472","2349","John L. Sullivan","Sullivan, John L.","","<p>John L. Sullivan was the last heavyweight American prizefighter to win his championship without wearing gloves ('bare knuckle').  He won by defeating Jake Kilrain at Richburg, Mississippi on August 7, 1889.  He was the son of Irish immigrants who became rich, which probably explains why General Compson uses him in <em>Absalom!</em> as a point of comparison with Thomas Sutpen, the 'immigrant' to Yoknapatawpha (34-35). His name also occurs in ""Lion"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> as a way to describe how the hunters in Yoknapatawpha feel about their sport: ""Boon and the conductor and the brakeman talked about Lion and Old Ben as people talked about Sullivan and Kilrain or Dempsey and Tunney"" (187, 218).</p>","No"
"22471","2348","Job Wylie","Job Wylie","","<p>Job Wylie was probably born a slave, owned by the man he still calls ""Marse Hoke Christian"" (233).  He has worked in the Christian family drugstore ever since it opened ""in eighteen-fifty-something,"" and in the present also works as Willy Christian's cook and housekeeper (226).  Job is very loyal to the Christian family, though according to the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" he also embodies Jefferson's ""timid clinging to dull and rule-ridden-breathing"" (239).</p>","Yes"
"22470","2347","Unnamed Texas Millionaire","Unnamed Texas Millionaire","","<p>All the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" says about the Texan whom Willy's sister married is that he is ""an oil millionaire"" (225).</p>","No"
"22469","2346","Unnamed Sister of Uncle Willy","Unnamed Sister of Uncle Willy","","<p>Willy Christian's sister in ""Uncle Willy"" was, like him, born in Jefferson, but she ""married an oil millionaire"" and now lives in Texas (225).  She feels enough concern for her brother's morphine addiction to return to Jefferson on one occasion, and for her family's local reputation to pay the woman Willy marries to leave town on a subsequent occasion.</p>","Yes"
"22468","2345","Unnamed People between Memphis and Renfro","Unnamed People between Memphis and Renfro","","<p>These are the people - referred to simply as ""they"" - in the seven different places where Secretary lands the plane as he tries to fly from Memphis to Renfro (243).  At each of these places, ""they tell him how to get to Renfro"" (243); the implication is that it is Secretary's fault that he cannot follow their directions.</p>","No"
"22467","2344","Unnamed Men in Bible Class","Unnamed Men in Bible Class","","<p>These are the adult men in ""Hair"" who attend ""Mr. Miller's men's Bible class"" at Reverend Schultz's church; they do not seem to play any role in the church's campaign to reform Willy (228).</p>","Yes"
"22466","2343","Unnamed Government Officials","Unnamed Government Officials","","<p>When the title character of ""Uncle Willy"" is told he cannot fly until he provides ""a permit from a doctor"" certifying he is healthy enough, he complains about ""these Republicans and Democrats and XYZ's"" who are to blame for all such government regulations (241).  ""XYZ's"" is probably his way of referring to the many new agencies that the Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt created, beginning in 1933, to try to lift the country out of the Great Depression; by 1935, when the story was published, these New Deal programs - the WPA, the CCC, the TVA, and so on - were popularly referred to as the ""alphabet agencies"" or even the ""alphabet soup.""  But nearly all the ""Republicans"" in government were opposed to Roosevelt's programs, so Willy's inclusion of them in his complaint makes this allusion more general.</p>","No"
"22465","2342","Unnamed Folks at Renfro","Unnamed Folks at Renfro","","<p>In ""Uncle Willy"" these ""folks in wagons and walking"" on the road in Renfro stop to watch when they reach the pasture where Secretary is trying to teach Willy how to fly the plane (244).  Since Secretary is black and Willy is white, the spectators' own race presumably affects the way they see this unusual sight, but the story says nothing to indicate what that is.</p>","No"
"22464","2341","Unnamed Field Workers 1","Unnamed Field Workers 1","","<p>These ""field hands"" at Renfro in ""Uncle Willy"" ""come up out of the fields"" to stare up at the spectacle of Secretary trying to teach Willy how to fly the plane (244).  Their perspective as they watch a black man teach a white man this skill would presumably depend on their own race, but the story says nothing to indicate what that is.</p>","No"
"22463","2340","Unnamed Mother of Narrator 1","Unnamed Mother of Narrator 1","","<p>The ""Mamma"" of the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" appears in the text only as the person Mrs. Merridew phones to complain about Willy's new wife (236).  Her son does not describe her own reaction to Mrs. Merridew's rage.</p>","Yes"
"22462","2339","Unnamed Father of Narrator 1","Unnamed Father of Narrator 1","","<p>""Papa,"" as the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" calls his father, is a ""lawyer"" (236).  Although he does not share any of the self-righteousness of the women who want to save Willy from his vices, he does participate in Mrs. Merridew's campaign to force Willy's wife to leave town, and in Job's attempt to keep Willy from flying his airplane.  He calls Willy a ""lunatic"" (239) and blames the old man for the narrator's various forms of truancy; the narrator himself repeatedly rejects both those interpretations.</p>","Yes"
"22461","2338","Unnamed Boys in Jefferson 1","Unnamed Boys in Jefferson 1","","<p>Although the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" has a particularly close relationship with Willy, he is also one of the group of twelve- to fourteen-year-old ""boys"" who ""see a lot"" of Willy, in two very different contexts (226).  They stop by his drugstore after their baseball games, where he feeds them ice cream while listening to their accounts of the games, and they watch him inject morphine; he joins them in church as a member of Mr. Barbour's Sunday School class for boys.   As boys, they simply accept his unusual behavior, even helping him shoot up on one occasion, and on another helping him break into his own store to steal alcohol.</p>","Yes"
"22460","2337","Unnamed ""Good Women in Jefferson""","Unnamed ""Good Women in Jefferson""","","<p>At the beginning of ""Uncle Willy"" the narrator identifies ""the good women in Jefferson"" as the people who are to blame for ""driving Uncle Willy out of town,"" and thus for the narrator's own choice to follow him (225).  The crusade against Willy's behavior is led by two particular women, Mrs. Merridew and Mrs. Hovis, yet at points the narrative seems to see the town's ""good women"" and the town's 'white' women as essentially synonymous.  Three women (whom the narrator calls ""ladies"") appear in the story, working with Merridew and Schultz to wean Willy from his vices (230); according to the narrator's description of the way these three address Willy - as ""Mr. Christian [or] Uncle Willy [or] Willy""- they are of different ages and are not all originally from town (230).  These reform-minded women are referred to again in <em>The Town</em>, where Charles calls them ""the church ladies"" (163).</p>","Yes"
"22459","2336","Secretary","Secretary","","<p>In ""Uncle Willy"" Secretary is the name of the ""negro boy"" whom Willy hires to drive his car (235).  In Faulkner's South, even adult black men are often called ""boys"" by white people, so although the juvenile narrator says that Secretary is ""about my size"" (235), he also says that Secretary is ""older than me"" (241) - though we have no way to know how much older.  Both the narrator and Willy describe Secretary as ""burr-headed,"" i.e. with short, bristly hair (235).  In some respects the story casts him in a stereotypical role for a black servant; he not only serves Willy faithfully, ""he reckoned he belonged to Uncle Willy"" (235); the narrator's father refers to both Secretary and Job as ""just irresponsible niggers"" (245).  But in other ways Secretary could be said to challenge stereotypical assumptions of black inferiority; he learns ""pretty quick"" to drive the car even in Memphis traffic (236), and later, when Willy buys an airplane, Secretary learns to fly ""in two weeks"" (245).  He may, in fact, be the earliest example in American literature of an African American aviator.</p>","Yes"
"22458","2335","Sister Schultz","Schultz, Sister","","<p>""Sister Schultz"" in ""Uncle Willy"" is probably Reverend Schultz' wife (229).  Like ""Brother Schultz"" and ""Brother Miller"" (229, 227), the title ""Sister"" most likely is a ceremonial title, indicating their fellowship as members of the same church.</p>","Yes"
"22457","2334","Reverend Schultz","Schultz, Reverend","","<p>Reverend Schultz is ""the minister"" of the Protestant church that both the narrator and title character of ""Uncle Willy"" attend (227).  Along with Mrs. Merridew, he leads the campaign to ""cure"" Willy of his addictions (232).  The narrator, who admires Willy Christian but not the town's 'Christians,' describes Schultz in the Sunday school class for adult men this way: ""sitting in the middle of them . . . like he was just a plain man like the rest of them yet kind of bulging out from among the others like he didn't have to move or speak them reminded that he wasn't a plain man"" (228).</p>","Yes"
"22456","2333","Uncle Robert","Robert, Uncle","","<p>The man whom the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" calls ""Uncle Robert"" (239) is presumably his biological uncle, the brother of his ""Papa"" or ""Mamma"" - although given the other ""Uncle"" in the story (i.e. Willy, who is not related to the narrator), and the way Southern culture often uses the term ceremonially with white as well as black men, it's hard to be certain of that.  Uncle Robert's one mention in the story, when he makes the ironic observation that no one who can manage to ""sell Jefferson real estate for cash"" could possibly be ""crazy"" (239), makes him sound similar to someone like Gavin Stevens, who is the biological and sardonic uncle of Charles Mallison, Faulkner's most frequently deployed boy-narrator.</p>","Yes"
"22455","2332","Brother Miller","Miller, Brother","","<p>""Brother Miller"" leads the adult men's Bible study class at the Protestant church that the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" attends (227).  In his case, ""Brother"" is a ceremonial title, reflecting his place in the church fellowship.  Willy reluctantly leaves the boys' class in Sunday school to sit in with the ""men"" (227).</p>","Yes"
"22454","2331","Mrs. Merridew","Merridew, Mrs.","","<p>Mrs. Merridew is the character whom the juvenile narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" casts as the story's main antagonist: when he accuses Job of telephoning ""<em>Her</em>"" about Willy's whereabouts, both he and Job know he means Mrs. Merridew (246).   She is a member of Reverend Schultz's church and the determined leader of the crusade to ""save"" Uncle Willy from his predilections, which she sees as both beastly and sinful (238).   Her efforts ""to give him a complete rebirth"" (232) begin with an intervention in church and ""a nice glass of cool lemonade"" (229), but become more and more drastic as he keeps finding ways to relapse, or falling into new forms of vice.  As she grows increasingly exasperated and even belligerent, her own priggish self-righteousness becomes increasingly clearer to the narrator, who learns from her behavior new ways to see ""the folks that are in"" the church (236).</p>","Yes"
"22453","2330","Mrs. Hovis","Hovis, Mrs.","","<p>In ""Uncle Willy"" Mrs. Hovis is among the ladies who try to reform the title character.  She alternates with Mrs. Merridew in staying with Willy ""day and night"" for three days as part of the plan to keep him away from morphine (229).  It seems likely that, like Merridew, she is a member of Reverend Schultz's congregation.</p>","Yes"
"22452","2329","Mrs. Christian","Christian, Mrs.","","<p>""Mrs. Christian"" (the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" gives her no other name) is a prostitute in Memphis whom Willy marries on one of his regular trips to the city, and an affront to most of Jefferson when he brings her back to his house.  She is ""twice as big as Uncle Willy,"" and visually conspicuous in her clothes - ""a red hat and a pink dress"" (236), ""a red-and-white striped dress so that she looked like a great big stick of candy"" (237), ""a black lace dress"" (238).  The unashamed sensuality she brings with her from a ""Manuel Street"" brothel - walking through town with ""both sides of her behind kind of pumping up and down"" (237) - attracts favorable attention from the men around the Square but outrages the guardians of propriety, who bribe her to leave Willy and return to Memphis just two days after her arrival.  On her way out, driving Willy's car, she stops in the Square to invite the men there to ""Come on up to Manuel Street and see me sometime"" - a phrase she may have learned from Mae West, the flamboyant movie sex symbol who invited Cary Grant to ""come up sometime and see me"" in <em>She Done Him Wrong</em> (1933), though in the way ""Mrs. Christian"" says it, this invitation is full of scorn for all the ""hicks"" in ""this town"" (238).</p>","Yes"
"22451","2328","Hoke Christian","Christian, Hoke","","<p>In ""Uncle Willy"" Hoke Christian first opened the drugstore that his son Willy still owns before the Civil War. He seems to have been a much more exemplary member of the community than Willy, but it's hard to determine his class. In addition to his business, he owned at least one slave, Job, and slave-owning is a characteristic of Yoknapatawpha's upper class families.  Talking about Willy, Mrs. Merridew refers to ""that position in the world which his family's name entitled him to"" (232).  But Mrs. Merridew herself is by no means a member of Jefferson's elite, and the story regularly subverts her judgments.  We think the ""position"" he occupies in the world Faulkner created is a middle class one.  (See also Unnamed Grandfather of Uncle Willy, a character who appears in <em>The Town</em> and who has a lot in common with this character, though not enough to say Faulkner meant them to be the same character.)</p>","Yes"
"22450","2327","Miss Callaghan","Miss Callaghan","","<p>In ""Uncle Willy"" Miss Callaghan is the narrator's teacher, at least for ""one year"" (228).</p>","Yes"
"22449","2326","Captain Bean","Bean, Captain","","<p>The Memphis man whom the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" identifies as ""Captain Bean at the airport"" refuses to teach Willy how to fly without a certificate from a doctor but <em>is</em> willing to teach Secretary, Willy's black driver - which seems to flaunt the rules of segregation (241).  His title suggests he may be an ex-World War I aviator, like many other flyers in Faulkner's fictions, but that is conjecture.</p>","No"
"22448","2325","Sonny Barger","Barger, Sonny","","<p>Since his store is on or near the street in Jefferson that the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" calls ""Nigger Row,"" it's possible that Sonny Barger is black, but more likely that he is one of Jefferson's white small businessmen who cater to poor people of both races - like Willy in his drugstore (234).  The fact that Barger sells the narrator a bottle of ""Jamaica ginger"" - a legal form of alcohol - suggests a seedy kind of establishment (234).</p>","Yes"
"22447","2324","Mr. Barbour","Barbour, Mr.","","<p>In ""Uncle Willy"" Mr. Barbour is the narrator's Sunday school teacher at the Protestant church.  He is apparently willing to let Willy sit in on the class, but he never calls on him.</p>","Yes"
"22446","2323","Papa George","Papa George","","<p>Georgie, the narrator of ""That Will Be Fine"" calls his father ""Papa,"" but his actual name is also George.  He is ""in the livery-stable business"" (268), and has no illusions about the dynamics of his wife's family or the character of its black sheep, his wife's brother Rodney.  When his wife's sister Louisa, for example, rationalizes Rodney's promiscuous behavior by pointing to his lack of opportunities ""to meet a nice girl and marry her,"" George says: ""Marry? Rodney marry? What in hell pleasure would he get out of slipping out of his own house and waiting until after dark and slipping around to the back and climbing up the gutter and into a room where there wasn't anybody in it but his own wife"" (274).  He clearly resents the fact that Rodney has ""tried every known plan to get [money] except work"" (267), and yet he works with his wife to avoid scandal, having paid five hundred dollars to cover Rodney's debts on one occasion at least.</p>","Yes"
"22445","2322","Mr. Watts 2","Watts, Mr. 2","","<p>The man with the badge outside Grandpa's house in Mottstown in ""That Will Be Fine"" reminds Georgie of ""Mr. Watts at Jefferson that catches the niggers,"" so it seems safe to say that Watts is either the sheriff or one of the deputies or, perhaps, the town marshal (277).  The fact that all the people he catches are black probably reflects the fact that most arrested people in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha are black, not that Watts has a special commission to catch Negroes.</p>","Yes"
"22444","2321","Unnamed Two Mottstown Men","Unnamed Two Mottstown Men","","<p>In ""That Will Be Fine,"" these two men prevent Georgie from seeing his uncle's corpse. One of them picks up Georgie and carries him away.  This man has a sense of irony worthy of Faulkner himself.  When Georgie naively asks if the ""wrapped bundle"" that other men are carrying (Rodney's corpse, ""wrapped in a quilt"" and laid on a shutter) is ""a Christmas present for Grandpa,"" this man replies yes, ""From all the husbands in Mottstown"" (286).</p>","Yes"
"22443","2320","Unnamed Six Mottstown Men","Unnamed Six Mottstown Men","","<p>These are the Mottstown men who carry Rodney's body to his father's house in ""That Will Be Fine""; Georgie says, ""I could look back and see the six men in the moonlight carrying the blind with the bundle on it"" (286).</p>","Yes"
"22442","2319","Unnamed Mottstown Women","Unnamed Mottstown Women","","<p>After Rodney's death, which the young narrator of ""That Will Be Fine"" is still ignorant of, he sees these ""ladies with shawls over their heads"" coming to offer their condolences to the family.</p>","Yes"
"22441","2318","Unnamed Lady in Mottstown","Unnamed Lady in Mottstown","","<p>This is the ""other lady in Mottstown"" who - according to the account of the very young narrator of ""That Will Be Fine"" - had ""business"" with Rodney, though ""just one time"" (268).  ""Business"" is the term Rodney gave his young nephew; a less naive narrator would say 'sex.'  ""Lady"" is the term that his culture taught this youngster to use for most white women; another narrator might use a different word here too.</p>","Yes"
"22440","2317","Mrs. Tucker","Tucker, Mrs.","","<p>In ""That Will Be Fine,"" Mrs. Tucker is one of Rodney's earlier Jefferson conquests, the married woman with whom he had an affair while visiting town ""last summer"" (266). One one occasion, Mrs. Tucker is ""sick,"" so Georgie doesn't get a quarter for his part in the ""business"" (285).</p>","Yes"
"22439","2316","Mr. Tucker","Tucker, Mr.","","<p>He is the husband of Rodney's earlier Jefferson conquest, Mrs. Tucker. Rodney makes clear to Georgie, the very young and uncomprehending narrator of ""That Will Be Fine,""  that Mr. Tucker is not involved in his ""business"" with Mrs. Tucker (266).</p>","Yes"
"22438","2315","Rosie","Rosie","","<p>Rosie, a servant working for the family of the narrator of ""That Will Be Fine,"" seems to have a clear understanding of her employers' characters.  In particular, she chastises young Georgie: ""You and money! If you ain't rich time you twenty-one, hit will be because the law done abolished money or done abolished you"" (265). Rosie, like Emmeline, has to do some of the cooking due to the absence of Grandma and Grandpa's servant, Mandy. Although she grumbles about her work, she performs it conscientiously.</p>","Yes"
"22437","2314","John Paul","John Paul","","<p>In ""That Will Be Fine,"" John Paul is the servant who drives the hack for Georgie's family and is willing to speak sarcastically about Uncle Rodney's behavior. He is observant and witty:  ""John Paul said he bet papa would like to give Uncle Rodney a present without even waiting for Christmas . . . a job of work""; ""John Paul quit laughing and said Sho, he reckoned anything a man kept at all the time, night and day both, he would call it work no matter how much fun it started out to be"" (270). When Georgie asserts that Uncle Rodney now works for the Compress Association, John Paul says ""it would sholy take a whole association to compress Uncle Rodney"" (270).</p>","Yes"
"22436","2313","Mandy 2","Mandy 2","","<p>Mandy cooks for Grandpa in ""That Will Be Fine,"" but she seems to have disappeared the day before Christmas, missing her duties as cook and leaving her cabin mysteriously ""locked on the inside"" (274).</p>","Yes"
"22435","2312","Mrs. Jordon","Jordon, Mrs.","","<p>Mrs. Jordon is Grandpa's Mottstown neighbor in ""That Will Be Fine""; at the end of the story, after Rodney is killed, Rosie is taking Georgie to her house for the night.</p>","Yes"
"22434","2311","Rodney","Rodney","Grandma, Grandpa","<p>The ""Uncle Rodney"" (266) of the narrator of ""That Will Be Fine"" is the youngest of three children.  He is also guilty of theft, fraud, and embezzlement. He is also a serial philanderer. Rodney manages the latter ""business"" by manipulating his nephew, Georgie, with promises of future monetary rewards. ""By God,"" he tells Georgie, ""some day you will be as good a businessman as I am"" (280).  His attempted elopement with a married woman on Christmas Eve goes horribly wrong, and Rodney winds up ""wrapped in a quilt"" and carried back to his family like a ""side of beef"" (286).</p>","Yes"
"22433","2310","Grandpa","Grandpa","","<p>The ""grandpa"" of the narrator of ""That Will Be Fine"" is married to grandma, and the father of Louisa, Sarah, and Rodney.  He knows his son is a criminal but covers for him as long as possible, apparently taking refuge or solace in anger and his ""tonic,"" which he keeps in a bottle in his desk - a desk which Rodney knows how to ""prize open"" in order to sneak his own (alcoholic) ""dose"" (266).</p>","Yes"
"22432","2309","Grandma","Grandma","","<p>In ""That Will Be Fine,"" Grandma is married to Grandpa and is mother to Aunt Louisa, Sarah, and Uncle Rodney.  She is Georgie's maternal grandmother, but Georgie pays little attention to her.</p>","Yes"
"22431","2308","Sarah","Sarah","Grandma, Grandma","<p>Sarah - Uncle Rodney's older sister, George's wife and woman whom the narrator of ""That Will Be Fine"" calls ""mamma"" (265) - is greatly upset by Rodney's behavior, mostly because gossip about it would damage ""the family's good name"" (267).  She is very class-conscious, but also genuinely concerned about her younger brother:  ""mamma cried and said how Uncle Rodney was the baby and that must be why papa hated him"" (268).</p>","Yes"
"22430","2307","Georgie","Georgie","","<p>Georgie, the seven-year-old narrator of ""That Will Be Fine,"" tells the essentially sordid and ultimately fatal story of his uncle Rodney from a perspective that emphasizes both the ignorance and self-centeredness of childhood.  He never questions or recognizes Rodney's various forms of social and criminal misbehavior, and his loyalty to Rodney has its roots less in family love than in greed. His notions of Christmas focus narrowly on money: ""I thought how maybe I could go on downtown when I got through working for Uncle Rodney and buy a present for Grandpa with a dime out of the ten quarters and give it to him tomorrow and maybe, because nobody else had given him a present, Grandpa might give me a quarter too instead of the dime tomorrow, and that would be twenty-one quarters, except for the dime, and that would be fine sure enough"" (278).  In the end, Georgie has learned nothing about his uncle, his family, or his own errors.</p>","Yes"
"22429","2306","Unnamed Baby of Louisa","Unnamed Baby of Louisa","Aunt Louisa, Fred 1","<p>This is the youngest child of Uncle Fred and Aunt Louisa.  Georgie's narrative in ""That Will Be Fine"" does provide either its name or its gender.</p>","Yes"

"22425","2302","Fred 1","Fred 1","","<p>In ""That Will Be Fine,"" this is the Fred who is Georgie's uncle and Aunt Louisa's husband; he lives with his wife's parents in Mottstown. Fred is aware of Rodney's crimes but unable to do much about them.</p>","Yes"
"22424","2301","Emmeline","Emmeline","","<p>In ""That Will Be Fine,"" Emmeline is the nursemaid for Aunt Louisa's baby.  She takes Mandy's place in cooking breakfast, complaining ""that she was going to waste all her Christmas doing extra work they never had the sense she give them credit for and that this looked like to her it was a good house to be away from nohow"" (279).</p>","Yes"
"22423","2300","Mrs. Church","Church, Mrs.","","<p>In ""That Will Be Fine,"" after Mrs. Church pays a call on Mrs. Pruitt, she gossips about her with the women of Grandpa's family, saying that she uses too much makeup, does not dress properly, and drinks.</p>","Yes"
"22422","2299","Yance","Yance","","<p>In ""Vendee"" Bayard says that the livestock pen at Ab Snopes' cabin was ""just like the one Ringo and Yance and I had built at home"" (100).  The reference to Yance is puzzling, since no character with that name is ever mentioned anywhere else in the fictions, and other <em>Unvanquished</em> stories describe in detail how Bayard, Ringo, Joby and Loosh build that pen at Sartoris. Faulkner might just have forgotten Joby's name: when he reprinted this story as a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, he changed the name ""Yance"" to ""Joby.""</p>","Yes"
"22421","2298","Benbow Family","Benbow Family","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> the Benbows are identified as one of the oldest and most prominent Yoknapatawpha families, though they do not figure among the county's large plantation owners, and individual members of that family play major roles in that novel, <em>Sanctuary</em> and ""There Was a Queen.""   In ""Skirmish at Sartoris,"" however, as a short story and again as a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>,the family is mentioned only as the antebellum owners of a ""carriage"" and the slave - ""Uncle Cash,"" or Cassius - who drove it (66).</p>","Yes"
"22420","2297","Unnamed Union General 2","Unnamed Union General 2","","<p>In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> the carpetbagger named Redmond associates himself with this general, ""the brigadier commanding the force which occupied Jefferson"" (183).

"22419","2296","General Joseph Mower","Mower, General Joseph","","<p><em>Requiem for a Nun</em> mentions the ""general of the United States army"" who takes charge of Jackson, Mississippi, after Union troops captured and burned it (87).

"22418","2295","Unnamed Town Wit 1","Unnamed Town Wit 1","","<p>The narrator of ""Mule in the Yard"" singles out from 'the town' as a group this one ""town wag"" who sends I.O. Snopes a printed train schedule, his wry commentary on all the mules that Snopes loses in ""accidents"" with freight trains on the ""blind curve"" on the railroad tracks (252).</p>","Yes"
"22417","2294","Unnamed Mule Drovers","Unnamed Mule Drovers","","<p>In ""Mule in the Yard"" these men help I.O. Snopes 'drive' (i.e. move - no vehicle is involved) his newly purchased mules from the railroad station past the Hait house to his pasture.</p>","Yes"

"22412","2289","Mannie Hait","Mannie Hait","","<p>Mannie Hait first appears in ""Mule in the Yard,"" and then returns in her role as widow and adversary of mules and I.O. Snopes when Faulkner re-tells the story in <em>The Town</em>.  In both texts she staunchly defends her house against both adversaries, but is defeated by her own carelessness.  In the end, however, despite the loss of her house, she manages to get even with one mule and one Snopes.  Her strength as a woman seems to be indicated both by her first name and by the clothes she wears: not just her dead husband's ""man's felt hat"" but also ""the man's shoes"" that she bought for herself after his death (250).</p>","Yes"
"22411","2288","Lonzo Hait","Hait, Lonzo","","<p>The ""defunct husband"" of Mrs. Hait - called simply Hait in ""Mule in the Yard"" (252) and Lonzo Hait  in <em>The Town</em> - was helping I.O. Snopes cheat the insurance company when he (along with a string of I.O.'s mules) was killed in a train accident on a blind curve next to his house in Jefferson.  According to what his widow says to I.O. in both texts, ""you paid him fifty dollars a trip each time he got mules in front of the train in time"" (262, 262).  According to the narrator of the short story, it was on an ""April dawn"" ten years earlier that his ""mangled remains"" were found on the track along with ""five mules and several feet of new Manila rope (252). (There's a good chance this Hait is the same character as the  ""local horse-and-mule trader"" named Marvin Hait who appears in <em>The Mansion</em>, 202.)</p>","Yes"
"22410","2287","Unnamed Town Officers 1","Unnamed Town Officers 1","","<p>In ""A Bear Hunt"" these ""town officers"" must be local law enforcement officials who, less than a week after Luke Provine appears in town carrying a black sample case, discover that what he is selling is bootleg whisky, a serious crime in Yoknapatawpha, which like the rest of Mississippi prohibited the sale of alcohol - not only during, but also before and after Prohibition (64).  (Mississippi did not legalize liquor until the 1960s.)  The story suggests they arrest Provine for his crime, but allow Major de Spain to ""extricate"" him from the charge (64).</p>","Yes"
"22409","2286","Unnamed People in Want","Unnamed People in Want","","<p>The narrator of ""A Bear Hunt"" identifies a group of men who, ""since the last year years, cannot find work"" (64).  The chronological reference probably points to the Great Depression of the 1930s, an era defined by mass unemployment and what the story calls ""men among us now whose families are in want"" (64). Also according to the narrator, in an apparent contradiction to the rest of the passage, ""these [men] all attain and hold to a ""certain respectability"" as salesmen of ""minor articles like soap and men’s toilet accessories and kitchen objects,"" which they carry around town in black sample cases (64).  (At first the narrator is surprised to see Lucius Provine with such a case, but within a week it is ""discovered that it contained whisky in pint bottles,"" 64.)</p>","Yes"
"22408","2285","Unnamed Negro Men at Picnic","Unnamed Negro Men at Picnic","","<p>These black men in ""A Bear Hunt"" were at a Negro church picnic some twenty years ago when they were set upon by the pistol-wielding Provine gang, then taken ""one by one"" and tormented and demeaned by having the celluloid shirt collars they wear burned, ""leaving each victim’s neck ringed with an abrupt and faint and painless ring of carbon"" (65).  The ring may have been ""painless,"" but the psychological scar it left is not - as beccomes clear when it is revealed at the very end of the story that one of men who was forced to wear it is Ash.</p>","Yes"
"22407","2284","Unnamed Negro Men at Hunting Camp","Unnamed Negro Men at Hunting Camp","","<p>An unspecified number of black men are present in the hunting camp in ""A Bear Hunt.""  Their role in the annual hunt is to cook and do other odd jobs around the camp. As blacks and as servants, they tend to be ignored or not noticed by the white hunters except when they are sought for some reason, as happens when Major de Spain calls for Old Man Ash to fetch him a drink when Ash has gone to the Indian mound. One of these other black servants appears with the ""demijohn and fixings"" and reports that Ash has gone ""up to'ds de mound"" (74).</p>","Yes"

"22405","2282","Unnamed Fellows","Unnamed Fellows","","<p>Ratliff calls the first people he encounters upon returning to Jefferson after his misadventure at the hunting camp in ""A Bear Hunt"" the ""first fellow"" and ""a fellow"" (66).  They ask about his facial injuries - one in standard English, one in a country vernacular - and their questions provide Ratliff with a way to begin his story.

"22404","2281","Unnamed Church-Going Ladies","Unnamed Church-Going Ladies","","<p>This group of ""ladies,"" most of whom are likely residents of Jefferson, are described by the narrator of ""A Bear Hunt"" as ""scurrying and screaming"" when, some twenty years earlier, the Provine gang would occasionally ""terrorize"" them by galloping horses in their midst as they were going to or from church on Sunday mornings (64).</p>","Yes"

As descendants of ""literate, town-bred people,"" their feelings about the ""profoundly and darkly enigmatic mound"" stem from their romantic ideas about Indians gotten from the ""secret dime novels which we passed among ourselves"" (65).

"22396","2273","Unnamed Suitors of Elly","Unnamed Suitors of Elly","","<p>In ""Elly"" the various men whom the title character kisses in the shadows on her veranda are described as ""youths and young men of the town at first, but later . . . almost anyone, any transient in the small town whom she met by either convention or by chance, provided his appearance was decent"" (208).</p>","Yes"
"22395","2272","Unnamed Sewing Women","Unnamed Sewing Women","","<p>These ""sewing women"" make the trousseau for Elly's wedding, coming to her house ""daily"" after the engagement to Philip is announced (214).

She says that the group she'll be with is comprised of ""people you don't know and that I don't expect to see again before I am married"" (215).  Since this party is meant to assuage any fears Philip might have about another man, one assumes she imagines it to be a respectable gathering of whites in the social class she shares with Paul, though she adds that ""there's another man in the party,"" and so her mother ""won't understand"" her going  (215), treading a fine line in describing an outing that should not concern a fiance even if it concerns a mother.</p>","No"
"22393","2270","Unnamed Man Plowing","Unnamed Man Plowing","","<p>Elly remembers this ""man plowing in that field"" when she and Paul returned to the car after their tryst (207).  Her self-consciousness about being seen by him is clear, but nothing about him is.  He could be a farmer, or a field hand, or a sharecropper.  He could be white or black, but because Faulkner typically specifies race when a character isn't white, and because Elly is particularly anxious about this man's having seen her and Paul together, it seems likely that he is white.</p>","No"
"22392","2269","Unnamed Uncle of Paul","Unnamed Uncle of Paul","","<p>According to a story that Elly's friend ""just heard,"" Paul de Montigny has an uncle who ""killed a man once that accused him of having nigger blood"" (209).  In the friend's mind, this story 'proves' that Paul himself is black, but while believing in 'black blood' as a kind of curse tells us something about the friend and the culture she grew up in, ""Elly"" does not allow us to say whether Paul even has an uncle, much less whether any of the friend's other assumptions and implications are true.</p>","No"
"22391","2268","Unnamed Man Paul's Uncle Killed","Unnamed Man Paul's Uncle Killed","","<p>According to the friend in ""Elly,"" this unnamed man was killed by Paul's uncle after he had suggested that the uncle was part black - or as the friend puts it, in language that reminds us that in the racist world of the story, such a 'suggestion' is actually an accusation, that the uncle had ""nigger blood"" (209).  The friend says she ""just heard"" this story (209).  Elly calls it a lie.  So it's possible neither the incident nor the uncle ever existed.</p>","No"
"22390","2267","Unnamed Friend of Elly","Unnamed Friend of Elly","","<p>Elly's unnamed friend entertains Paul de Montigny in her home, but is quick to judge Elly for the latter's interest in him.  Elly's friend smokes, furtively, in her home, presumably hoping to escape detection by her parents.  But if she too is rebellious, it is within very fixed limits.  When Elly defends her behavior with Paul by reminding this girl that ""you invited him into your house,"" she replies ""I wasn't hid in the cloak closet, kissing him, though"" (210).  And despite entertaining Paul, she takes the signs of his mixed racial identity as proof of Elly's ""queer taste"" (209).</p>","Yes"
"22389","2266","Unnamed Cousin of Elly","Unnamed Cousin of Elly","Unnamed Uncle of Elly, Unnamed Aunt of Elly","<p>In the short story names after her, Elly stays in her cousin's room during her visit to her uncle and aunt in Mills City.

"22388","2265","Unnamed Mother of Elly","Unnamed Mother of Elly","","<p>Elly's mother lives with her, her husband and especially her mother-in-law in a ""biggish house"" in Jefferson (208).  She is a negligible figure in her daughter's life, though it is her suggestion that Elly drive to Mills City to pick up that mother-in-law that precipitates the story's violent climax.</p>","Yes"
"22387","2264","Unnamed Father of Elly","Unnamed Father of Elly","Ailanthia","<p>Elly's father lives in Jefferson with her, his wife, and especially his mother.  He is a negligible figure in her life, dominated as it by his mother.  The one time he and Elly are together, at breakfast, Elly thinks: ""He said nothing, apparently knew nothing"" (211).</p>","Yes"
"22386","2263","Ailanthia","Ailanthia","","<p>Elly's grandmother - Elly's father's mother - lives in Elly's family's home in Jefferson, though she is formerly of Louisiana.  Her given name is Ailanthia, as is that of the granddaughter after whom ""Elly"" is titled.  Elly's grandmother is frequently described as cold: ""cold, piercing"" (209), with ""that cold, fixed, immobile, inescapable gaze of the very deaf,"" having lost her hearing 15 years before the story takes place (212).  The narrator calls her an ""old woman whose hearing had long since escaped everything and whose sight nothing escaped"" (223).  The ""cold, still, implacable"" disapproval Elly sees in Ailanthia's eyes steadily increases the granddaughter's desperation (212).</p>","Yes"
"22385","2262","Unnamed Uncle of Elly","Unnamed Uncle of Elly","Ailanthia","<p>The uncle of the title character of ""Elly"" is the son of her grandmother Ailanthia; he lives in Mills City with his wife and daughter.</p>","No"
"22384","2261","Unnamed Car Drivers","Unnamed Car Drivers","","<p>Although ""Elly"" begins and ends on the road between Jefferson and Mills City, the only other drivers mentioned in the story are referred to, obliquely, at the very end, after the accident, when Elly thinks, ""They won't even stop to see if I am hurt"" (224).  Their presence is indicated only by the ""snore of an engine, the long hissing of tires in gravel"" that she hears on the road above her (223).</p>","No"
"22383","2260","Unnamed Aunt of Elly","Unnamed Aunt of Elly","","<p>In ""Elly,"" Elly's aunt is the wife of Ailanthia's son.  She lives with her husband and daughter in Mills City.</p>","No"
"22382","2259","Philip","Philip","","<p>Philip is ""a grave, sober young man of impeccable character and habits"" who courts the title character of ""Elly"" with clock-like regularity (213).   As a Jefferson boy whom she has known ""from childhood,"" Philip is the epitome of a suitable husband for Elly (213).  His draw as a suitor is indicated in the same breath as his current occupation: ""an assistant cashier in the bank, who they said would be president of it some day"" (213).</p>","Yes"
"22381","2258","Elly","Elly","Unnamed Mother of Elly, Unnamed Father of Elly","<p>The title character of ""Elly"" is eighteen years old.  She ""lives in Jefferson . . . with her father and mother and grandmother in a biggish house"" (208).  Elly has inherited her given name, Ailanthia, from her grandmother, a link that Faulkner uses to underscore the generational tension between the grandmother's Victorian sexual repression and Southern racial prejudices, and Elly's restlessness with these taboos.  Modern enough to engage in kissing sessions with the young men who court her, Elly loses her virginity to Paul - an outsider whose ambiguous racial identity (Elly's grandmother is sure Paul is a Negro) attracts Elly in ways that remain unarticulated.  Elly expresses herself largely through her physicality, first using her youthful sexuality to attract suitors, and then later climbing the stairs ""with the tread almost of an old woman"" when she is burdened by her grandmother's censure (208).  She is able to ""change completely"" (208), depending on her mood and her company.  She is injured, but apparently not fatally, in the automobile accident that, technically, she causes, but that psychologically is the result of her own ambivalence about both her grandmother's prejudices and Paul's 'blackness.'</p>","Yes"
"22380","2257","Paul de Montigny","De Montigny, Paul","","<p>There is a lot that ""Elly"" never explains about Paul's character - where he lives, for example, and what he does - but the one mystery that matters most is his racial identity.  Paul visits Jefferson as a white man, but the friend who introduces him to Elly insists he is really black.  As part of her proof, she recounts a story in which Paul's ""uncle killed a man once that accused him of having nigger blood"" (209).  Elly's grandmother also believes that he's black, claiming to know ""the name which his people have borne for four generations"" in Louisiana, a time span that suggests the family changed their identity after the Civil War (218).  Both Elly's friend and Elly's grandmother bolster their claims by pointing to what they 'see' in Paul's physical appearance.  Elly's friend points to ""his hair . . . Like a knitted cap.  And his lips.  Blubber, almost"" (209).  Though Elly points to his education at Virginia and Harvard ""and everywhere"" as evidence that he is white, Elly's grandmother points to ""his hair, his fingernails, if you need proof"" of black blood (218).  Notably, Paul himself never addresses his racial heritage, even when Elly brings it up directly at the end.  In the story, he stands apart from others largely in being impervious to Elly's attempts to manipulate him.</p>","Yes"
"22374","2256","Unnamed Neighbor of Sutpen 1","Unnamed Neighbor of Sutpen 1","","<p>Sutpen's ""nearest neighbor"" in ""Wash"" lives a mile away from his plantation; when after the war Sutpen gets too drunk to get home on his own from the store, Wash walks to this man's place and borrows a wagon to carry him in (540).</p>","Yes"
"22373","2255","Unnamed Slaves at Sutpen's","Unnamed Slaves at Sutpen's","","<p>These are the enslaved people in ""Wash"" who call Wash ""white trash behind his back"" (536), and to his face pointedly ask him  ""Why ain't you at de war, white man?"" (537).  When they do that, Wash can see their ""white eyes and teeth behind which derision lurked"" (537).  ""Most"" of Sutpen's slaves leave to follow the Union army toward freedom after ""Sherman passes through the plantation"" (537).</p>","Yes"
"22372","2254","Unnamed Slave at Sutpen's","Unnamed Slave at Sutpen's","","<p>In ""Wash"" this ""house servant"" - also called a ""Negress"" - is ""one of the few Negroes who remained"" at Sutpen's after the Sherman and the ""Federal troops"" had passed through (537).  She refuses to allow Wash Jones to enter the Sutpen mansion while Sutpen is away at the war - not even by way of ""the kitchen steps"" (537).  (Her treatment of Wash anticipates the character of Clytemnestra in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, but there is no hint in the story that she is related to the white family she serves.)</p>","Yes"
"22371","2253","Unnamed Half-Grown White Boy","Unnamed Half-Grown White Boy","","<p>In ""Wash,"" this ""half-grown white boy"" finds the body of Thomas Sutpen lying outside the tumble-down fishing camp. After ""a mesmerized instant"" in which he looks at Wash looking at him through a window in the camp, he runs off to report the crime (546).  Although Faulkner omits his race (and a hyphen) when he returns to this ""halfgrown boy"" in <em>Absalom!</em>, he does add a couple of aural details to make the event more dramatic: the boy is ""whistling"" when he first sees the body, and he ""screams"" when he sees ""Wash in the window, watching him"" (229).</p>","Yes"
"22369","2252","Dicey|Negro Midwife","Dicey|Negro Midwife","","<p>In both ""Wash"" and <em>Absalom!</em> Milly's baby is delivered by an old Negro midwife who lives in a cabin ""three miles"" from the fishing camp (542, 230).  The short story refers to her mainly as ""the Negress"" (535), but Sutpen once calls her ""Dicey"" (544).  She is not named in the novel.  In the short story  she witnesses Wash killing Sutpen, ""peering around the crazy door with her black gargoyle face of a worn gnome"" (545), while in the novel she only hears this event from inside the camp.  In both texts she flees as soon as it happens.</p>","Yes"
"22368","2251","Unnamed Young Man in Beyond","Unnamed Young Man in Beyond","","<p>This young man is the first to speak with the Judge in Beyond (and in ""Beyond"").  He died in a car accident when, late for his wedding, he was ""driving fast"" and ""had to turn"" when a ""child ran into the road"" (784).  He assumes that the Judge is looking for his own wife, and he sympathizes with him because ""It must be hell on the one who has to watch and wait for the other one he or she has grown old in marriage with, because it is so terrible to wait and watch like me, for a girl who is a maiden to you"" (784).</p>","No"

"22364","2247","Unnamed Other Children","Unnamed Other Children","","<p>These ""other children"" in ""Beyond"" are the ones who gave the young mother's son the scars he bears ""one day when they were playing"" (794).  It isn't clear if this happened in a previous life, or in Beyond, but what the mother says - ""they didn't know they were going to hurt him"" (794) - adds to the details in the story that suggest a connection between this anonymous mother and son and Mary and Jesus in the New Testament.</p>","No"

When she first appears she is ""carrying a child"" (791), but she does not provide any details about her previous existence.  She treats her son ""with an air fond and unconcerned,"" soothing him when he fusses and doling out toys to him (793).  Ingersoll tells the judge to ""Follow her"" (791).  Like her son with the scars, she evokes the Christ story, with which as a freethinker the judge has struggled his entire adult life.</p>","No"

If he ain't there, he ought to be"" (788).  The book titled 'Little Women' was of course not written by a man, and the story doesn't give any further information about either the books or the person Mothershed is thinking of.  One possibility is Edward Stratemeyer (1863-1930), who wrote books under pseudonyms for boys as well as girls, but there's no way to say if Faulkner is even thinking about an actual children's book author.</p>","No"
"22359","2242","Unnamed Old Gentleman","Unnamed Old Gentleman","","<p>This ""old gentleman"" gave the toy soldiers to the boy that the Judge meets in Beyond (793).  He himself does not appear, but the boy's mother describes him as having ""lived here a long time, they say,"" and being ""quite wealthy,"" ""with a white mustache and that kind of popping eyes that old people have who eat too much"" (793).

Typically, a 'footman' is a liveried servant - and not usually found in an American, much less a Southern context.

Of him the Judge says, ""for the last fifteen years my one intellectual companion has been a rabid atheist, almost an illiterate, who not only scorns all logic and science, but who has a distinct body odor as well"" (789).  The Judge's characterization of Mothershed is odd, since they spent their afternoons discussing thinkers like Ingersoll, Voltaire, and Paine (786, 787).

In ""Beyond,"" Faulkner locates Ingersoll in the story's version of heaven, and gives him the role of interlocutor to the protagonist's doubts about God and the afterlife; Ingersoll listens to what Judge Allison says about his life and ideas, but he doesn't offer any solutions or answers.  In a ""pleasant, tranquil voice"" that sets this ""Ingersoll"" apart from the spell-binding Gilded Age orator, he merely tells the Judge to follow the young woman ""who just passed, carrying a child,"" and ""look into her face"" (791).</p>","No"

He is a Federal judge, ""a Republican office-holder in a Democratic stronghold"" who shares the political leanings of his wife's father and a ""great reader"" whose ""life is a solitary one"" (789).  He is a lifelong religious skeptic whose doubts have only intensified since his son's death eighteen years ago.  The judge's political affiliation is unusual for a white Southerner in the 1930s; the region was overwhelmingly Democratic.  His life is also probably ""a solitary one"" because of his position as a ""Federal,"" not a county or state, judge (789).

As spectators, they are suspicious of newcomers - again like the people of Jefferson.  When the Hineses first move to Mottstown, ""the town"" wonders about them but eventually comes to take their presence for granted (341).  Decades later, when Christmas is captured, a crowd made up of ""clerks"" and ""countrymen in overalls"" and others quickly forms ""about the square and before the jail (348).   The next day, when the Jefferson officers arrive to take custody of Joe, the crowd swells to about two hundred and includes women.  The town sheriff worries that the crowd may turn into a lynch mob, but they respond with talk instead of violence.  Much of Chapter 14 (pages 349-361) is in quotation marks, but no single person is speaking.  Instead, Faulkner allows the town and surrounding countryside to describe both Christmas' and the Hineses' behavior.  It is introduced with a description of ""the talk"" that circulated ""in electrically lighted rooms and in remote hill cabins with kerosene lamps,"" about ""country churches"" or the ""dooryards of houses"" (349).  This collective voice is mostly male (talking to ""wives and families"" or while ""womenfolks are in the kitchen, getting dinner"" (349).  It is decidedly white: the first line of this narration says that Christmas ""dont look any more like a nigger than I do"" (349).

"22289","2172","Unnamed People at the Dance","Unnamed People at the Dance","","<p>The country people at what Bobbie calls ""the clodhopper dance"" in <em>Light in August</em> (218) are described as ""girls in stiff offcolors and mailorder stockings and heels"" and ""young men in illcut and boardlike garments"" (206).

"22288","2171","Unnamed People at Prayer Meeting","Unnamed People at Prayer Meeting","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em>, when Doc Hines disrupts a prayer meeting by ""yelling"" for ""white folks to turn out and kill"" all the blacks, the ""folks in the church"" make him come down from the pulpit (378).  When he threatens them with a pistol, they call the law.</p>","No"
"22287","2170","Unnamed People at Church Revival","Unnamed People at Church Revival","","<p>One story that is told in <em>Light in August</em> about the first Gail Hightower concerns the time he invaded an ""al fresco church revival"" and ""turned it into a week of amateur horse racing"" while a ""dwindling congregation"" listened to the ""gaunt, fanaticfaced country preachers"" (472) condemn him.</p>","Yes"
"22286","2169","Unnamed People along Lena's Way","Unnamed People along Lena's Way","","<p>These are the people in <em>Light in August</em> who, Lena says, ""have been right kind"" to her during her travels on foot from Alabama to Yoknapatawpha.  The narrative implies a difference between the way men and women judge Lena when it describes Mrs. Beard looking at her ""once, completely, as strange women had been doing for four weeks now"" (85).  Nonetheless the narrative does confirm Lena's assertion that everyone is ""kind.""  When she inquires for Lucas Burch, people send her along to the next town, often finding her a ride in the process.</p>","No"
"22285","2168","Unnamed Parents of Hightower's Mother","Unnamed Parents of Hightower's Mother","","<p><em>Light in August</em> never gives Reverend Hightower's mother a first name, much less a maiden one.  But it does tell us that ""she was one of many children of a genteel couple who had never got ahead and who seemed to find in the church some substitute for that which lacked upon the dinnertable"" (472).</p>","No"
"22284","2167","Unnamed Orphans","Unnamed Orphans","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> these children in the Memphis orphanage wear ""identical and uniform blue denim"" (119).  Joe seems to live apart from most of them, except a few of the older girls who show him some maternal kindess.  According to Hines and the dietitian, at least some of these children call Joe ""Nigger"" (127).</p>","No"
"22283","2166","Unnamed Orphanage Workers","Unnamed Orphanage Workers","","<p>The women who work at the Memphis orphanage where Christmas lives in <em>Light in August</em> include the ones who find him ""on that doorstep that Christmas night"" and so decide to give him the last name of ""Christmas"" (383-84).  Five years later two young women clean and dress Joe Christmas before he leaves the orphanage with Simon McEachern.</p>","No"
"22282","2165","Unnamed Northern Prostitute","Unnamed Northern Prostitute","","<p>This prostitute in <em>Light in August</em> has just had sex with a black patron before Joe's ""turn,"" so she responds with indifference when Christmas tries to provoke her by saying ""that he is a negro"" (225).  In response, he beats her so badly that ""at first they thought that the woman was dead"" (225).</p>","No"
"22281","2164","Unnamed Northern Policemen","Unnamed Northern Policemen","","<p>In an unidentified northern city or town in <em>Light in August</em>, these ""two policemen"" subdue Christmas after he nearly beats a prostitute to death (225).</p>","No"
"22280","2163","Unnamed Negroes in the North","Unnamed Negroes in the North","","<p>Part of the time Christmas is on ""the street which was to run for fifteen years"" in <em>Light in August</em> he spends in Chicago and Detroit, living and eating ""with negroes"" (225) as a Negro himself.

"22279","2162","Unnamed Negro Woman in the North","Unnamed Negro Woman in the North","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> Joe Christmas and this woman lives ""as man and wife"" in Chicago or Detroit (225).  According to the narrator, , she resembles ""an ebony carving,"" and as Joe lies in bed with her he ""tries to breathe into himself the dark odor, the dark and inscrutable thinking and being of negroes"" (225-26).  Since she is the only Negro woman whom the narrative mentions Joe living with, it seems likely that she is the woman Joe is remembering when he thinks about the possibility that Joanna might reject him: ""No white woman ever did that. Only a nigger woman ever give me the air, turned me out"" (236).</p>","No"
"22278","2161","Burringtons in New Hampshire","Burringtons in New Hampshire","","<p>According to Joanna in <em>Light in August</em>, many members of the Burrington family she descends from still live in New Hampshire, although she has only seen these relatives ""perhaps three times in her life"" (241).</p>","No"

"22276","2159","Unnamed Negroes Who Flee Christmas","Unnamed Negroes Who Flee Christmas","","<p>In a cabin that he enters during his flight in <em>Light in August</em>, Christmas ""sees negro dishes, negro food,"" and feels the presence of ""flight and abrupt consternation"" (335).  From these details we can construct the blacks who live in the cabin, but in fact they never appear except as the ""long, limber black hands"" that put the food in front of him.  And they are only heard in the ""wails of terror and distress"" that Christmas ""hears without hearing them"" (335).  As he eats, Christmas registers their fear and calls himself ""their brother"" (335).</p>","Yes"
"22275","2158","Unnamed Negroes in Mottstown","Unnamed Negroes in Mottstown","","<p>During the thirty years that the Hineses live in Mottstown in <em>Light in August</em>, they depend largely on the charity of the Negroes who live in their neighborhood, despite Doc's racist sermons and overall belligerence.  In particular the narrative mentions ""the negro women"" of Mottstown, who bring dishes of food, possibly from the white kitchens where they cook, to the Hineses at their house (341).</p>","Yes"
"22274","2157","Unnamed Negroes in Freedman Town","Unnamed Negroes in Freedman Town","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> these Negroes live in Freedman Town, the specifically black section of Jefferson.  Though they are described as ""invisible"" to Joe, as he walks past their cabins he is very conscious of the way they and their ""negro smell"" seem to enclose him, ""like bodiless voices murmuring talking laughing in a language not his"" (114).  He is particularly conscious of the murmuring ""bodiless fecundmellow voices of [the] negro women"" there (115).</p>","Yes"
"22273","2156","Unnamed Negroes in Country Churches","Unnamed Negroes in Country Churches","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> these members of ""remote negro churches"" ""about the county"" listen to Doc Hines when he interrupts their services to commandeer the pulpit and preach to them about ""the superiority of the white race"" (343).

"22271","2154","Unnamed Negro Yardmen 2","Unnamed Negro Yardmen 2","","<p>When McEachern tells him about ""work"" in <em>Light in August</em>, Joe understands what it means by remembering that ""he had seen work going on in the person of men with rakes and shovels about the playground [of the Memphis orphanage] six days each week"" (144).  Based on the kind of work these men are doing, and the patterns of the Yoknapatawpha fictions as a group, it seems very likely that these men are black.</p>","No"
"22270","2153","Unnamed Negro Woman Wearing Christmas' Shoes","Unnamed Negro Woman Wearing Christmas' Shoes","","<p>This is the woman in <em>Light in August</em> who trades ""a pair of her husband's brogans"" to Joe Christmas in return for his shoes (329).  She is 'captured' anticlimactically when the Sheriff's dogs follow the scent of the shoes to the cabin next to a corn field where she and her family live; when the armed posse kicks open the door she drops the iron skillet she was holding.</p>","Yes"
"22269","2152","Unnamed Negro Woman Near Burden Place","Unnamed Negro Woman Near Burden Place","","<p>This woman is mentioned by Byron in <em>Light in August</em>, who tells Hightower that there is ""a nigger woman, old enough to be sensible, that dont live over two hundred yards away"" from the cabin on the Burden place where he has moved Lena (314).  He says she can help Lena when she goes into labor.</p>","Yes"
"22268","2151","Unnamed Negro Woman in Labor","Unnamed Negro Woman in Labor","","<p>She and her husband live in a cabin ""immediately behind"" Hightower's house in <em>Light in August</em> (73).  Her husband leaves her to get help in the middle of her labor; when Hightower arrives in response, he finds her ""on her hands and knees on the floor, trying to get back into bed, screaming and wailing"" (74).  With Hightower's help she delivers the baby, but it is ""already dead"" - ""doubtless injured when she left the bed"" (74).</p>","Yes"
"22267","2150","Unnamed Negro Who Disappeared","Unnamed Negro Who Disappeared","","<p>This character in <em>Light in August</em> is enigmatic.  He is mentioned by the ""old negro woman"" whom Joe Brown asks to take a message to the Sheriff for him (433-34).  She refuses, citing the case of this man as her reason: ""I done had one nigger that thought he knowed a sheriff well enough to go and visit with him.  He aint never come back, neither"" (434).</p>","Yes"
"22266","2149","Unnamed Stillborn Negro Baby","Unnamed Stillborn Negro Baby","Unnamed Negro Husband 1","<p><em>Light in August</em> does not identify the sex of the baby that Hightower delivers in the cabin behind his house, saying only that ""it was already dead"" before it was born (74).</p>","Yes"
"22265","2148","Unnamed Negro Planing Mill Workers","Unnamed Negro Planing Mill Workers","","<p><em>Light in August</em> never explicitly identifies the ""fellows"" who are shoveling sawdust at the planing mill when Christmas is hired and told to ""get a scoop and help them fellows move that sawdust"" (33).  But the narrator calls the work Joe is doing a ""negro's job"" (36), and ""Joe Brown,"" who shovels sawdust alongside Christmas, calls it ""doing the work of a nigger slave"" (96).  So that's the logic behind our decision to add this Character to the database: the job is associated with blacks, and so the ""fellows"" doing it when Christmas starts work are presumably black.</p>","Yes"
"22264","2147","Unnamed Negro Nursemaids","Unnamed Negro Nursemaids","","<p>According to the narrator of <em>Light in August</em>, ""few of the townspeople"" take any notice of the sign in front of Hightower's house (58), but ""now and then"" an  ""idle and illiterate"" ""negro nursemaid with her white charges would loiter"" and spell out the letters on it (59).</p>","Yes"
"22263","2146","Unnamed Negro Neighbors of Joanna Burden","Unnamed Negro Neighbors of Joanna Burden","","<p>Although the white people of Jefferson shun Joanna Burden in <em>Light in August</em>, the people of the local black community have close ties with her, as indicated by the footpaths from their cabins to her big house, paths which ""radiate from her house like wheelspokes"" (257).  She ""visits them when they are sick,"" Byron tells Lena, ""like they was white"" (53).  And living at the Burden place Joe notes ""the negro women who came to the house from both directions up and down the road,"" ""usually singly though sometimes in twos and threes,"" and wearing the ""aprons and headrags"" that are the costume of their caste (257).</p>","Yes"
"22262","2145","Unnamed Negro Letter Writers","Unnamed Negro Letter Writers","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> Joanna Burden conducts a steady and voluminous correspondence with ""the presidents and faculties and trustees"" and ""young girl students and even alumnae"" of various southern Negro schools and colleges.

The narrative suggests that he is afraid to approach a white woman to ask for help: ""Hightower knew that the man would walk all the way to town . . . instead of asking some white woman to telephone for him"" (74).</p>","Yes"
"22259","2142","Unnamed Negro College Teachers and Students","Unnamed Negro College Teachers and Students","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> Joanna Burden leaves Jefferson several times a year, for ""three and four days,"" during which she visits the various ""negro schools and colleges through the south"" that she supports (233).

"22257","2140","Unnamed Negro Bootblack in Mottstown","Unnamed Negro Bootblack in Mottstown","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> this bootblack works in the Mottstown barber shop where Christmas gets a shave.  The barbershop is identified as ""a white barbership,"" but in that context the adjective refers to the patrons it serves (349).  The race of the bootblack is not specified, but since the job he performs, shining shoes, is typically done in Faulkner's fiction by blacks, we have identified his race as ""Black.""  This bootblack notices that Joe is wearing ""second hand brogans that are too big for him"" (349).</p>","Yes"
"22256","2139","Unnamed Negro ""Pappy""","Unnamed Negro ""Pappy""","","<p>The Negro who gives Christmas a ride into Mottstown in <em>Light in August</em> tells him that he is going there to pick up ""a yellin calf"" that ""pappy bought"" (339).

"22255","2138","Unnamed Cafe Employee in Mottstown","Unnamed Cafe Employee in Mottstown","","<p>At the ""little cafe down by the depot"" in Mottstown in <em>Light in August</em>, this ""cafe man"" serves dinner to Doc and Mrs. Hines and suggests they hire a car to take them to Jefferson rather than wait for the train (359).</p>","Yes"
"22254","2137","Unnamed Moonshine Buyers 1","Unnamed Moonshine Buyers 1","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> Joe Christmas and Joe Brown make enough money selling illegal whiskey in Jefferson to quit their jobs at the planing mill and buy a car.  The narrative refers several times to the men who buy from them, but the closest it ever comes to individualizing these customers is when it says that the ""young men and even boys"" in town all know that they can purchase whiskey ""from Brown almost on sight"" (46).</p>","Yes"
"22253","2136","Unnamed Ministers at the Seminary","Unnamed Ministers at the Seminary","","<p>The men who are Hightower's teachers at the seminary in <em>Light in August</em> are also Presbyterian ministers.

"22250","2133","Unnamed Men in Max's Restaurant","Unnamed Men in Max's Restaurant","","<p>The ""clump of men"" sitting in Max's restaurant the first time Christmas goes there in <em>Light in August</em> are described as ""not farmers and not townsmen either""; with ""their tilted hats and their cigarettes and their odor of barbershops,"" they look like they ""had just got off a train,"" ""would be gone tomorrow,"" and do ""not have any address"" (178, 174).</p>","No"

"22248","2131","Unnamed Men at Farm House","Unnamed Men at Farm House","","<p>On the fourth day of his flight in <em>Light in August</em> Christmas smells breakfast cooking at a farm house, but waits to approach it until he sees ""the men"" of the farm finish eating and ""go to the field"" (332).</p>","Yes"
"22247","2130","Unnamed Memphis Reporters","Unnamed Memphis Reporters","","<p>On the ""Sunday morning"" after Mrs. Hightower's scandalous death in <em>Light in August</em>, Hightower's church is beset by swarm of ""Memphis reporters taking pictures"" (67).  They even ""follow him into the church"" (68).</p>","Yes"
"22246","2129","Unnamed Members of Other Congregations","Unnamed Members of Other Congregations","","<p>After Hightower refuses to resign from his pulpit in the Presbyterian church in <em>Light in August</em>, members of other churches in Jefferson come to see him ""out of curiosity for a time"" (69).

"22245","2128","Unnamed Members of Hightower's Congregation","Unnamed Members of Hightower's Congregation","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> the old men and women, pillars of the church, are among the first to ""astonished and dubious"" about Reverend Hightower's obsessions (61). Others increasingly view his behavior and preaching with suspicion, and gossip about him and his wife - though they also raise funds to pay for Mrs. Hightower's treatment in a sanatorium and cook meals for him during her absence.  When his preaching becomes more incoherent after her death, they finally lock him out of the church - though they also raise funds to help him relocate in another town, and are disappointed when he stays.  In other words, the novel's representation of these Presbyterians is complex, though on the whole it sees them in the same negative way that Hightower, after he has been defrocked, hears them during choir practice: their songs reveal that ""pleasure . . . they cannot seem to bear . . . And so why should not their religion drive them to crucifixion of themselves and one another?"" (368).</p>","Yes"
"22244","2127","Unnamed Jurors 3","Unnamed Jurors 3","","<p>The phrase ""Grand Jury"" suggests ""something"" ""secret"" and ""of a hidden and unsleeping and omnipotent eye"" to Percy Grimm's platoon of peace-keepers (456).  In <em>Light in August</em> the ""Grand Jury"" that is empaneled to consider the charges against Joe Christmas does remain mysterious.  The narrator, for example, says that ""the Grand Jury . . . indicts"" Christmas, which is the customary task of a Grand Jury (421), but the same narrator says that this Jury is meeting ""to take the life of a man whom few of them had ever seen to know, for having taken the life of a woman whom even fewer of them had known to see"" (416).  Finding guilt and meting out punishment are customarily the tasks of a trial jury.</p>","Yes"

When she hears that Joe Christmas is being called a Negro, she decides to place him with a family as quickly as possible.  She seems to have the child's interests at heart, both in making sure Christmas doesn't have to go to the ""colored"" orphanage, and in keeping the rumors about his race from McEachern, the white man who adopts him.</p>","No"
"22241","2124","Unnamed Man with Candy","Unnamed Man with Candy","","<p>This is the man in <em>Light in August</em> who sells Joe Christmas the ""stale and flyspecked box of candy"" he had won ""for ten cents on a punching board in a store"" (191).</p>","No"

"22238","2121","Unnamed Man at Max's","Unnamed Man at Max's","","<p>This is the ""second man"" who is at Max's house when Joe arrives there looking for Bobbie in <em>Light in August</em>; Joe had ""never seen"" him before, but he is obviously a kind of partner in Max and Mame's prostitution racket (214).  He certainly dresses the part of a gangster from this era: ""His hat was tipped forward so that the shadow of the brim fell across his mouth"" (214).  He assists Max and Mame's hasty departure from town. He beats Joe into insensibility.</p>","No"
"22237","2120","Unnamed Sexual Partner of Mrs. Hightower","Unnamed Sexual Partner of Mrs. Hightower","","<p>The man whom Mrs. Hightower meets in a Memphis hotel in <em>Light in August</em> is drunk when he registers under a fictitious name as her husband.

When this woman returns home, she tells others what she saw.</p>","Yes"
"22231","2114","Unnamed Jefferson Townsmen 2","Unnamed Jefferson Townsmen 2","","<p>This entry supplements the ""Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople"" entry.  It is necessary because, in addition to the major role that the white population as an aggregate plays in <em>Light in August</em>, the narrative identifies a number of behaviors specifically with the town's population of white males.  For instance, after Hightower is rejected by his congregation, it is ""loafers and such,"" men ""who never went to church"" and ""little boys who did not know exactly"" what the scandal was about, who listen to Hightower preach, and then, after his congregation finally locks him out of the church, it is a similarly male-identified group that witnesses his humiliation standing at the door  (70).  The novel's groups of men behave in multiple and sometimes contradictory ways when race, gender, sexuality are at issue.  Hightower's employment of female and male Negro cooks, for example, occasions violent reprisals as well as offers of protection from differing groups including, presumably, the Ku Klux Klan. (The novel never directly identifies the members of the Ku Klux Klan, but Hightower receives a threat signed ""K.K.K,"" 72).</p>","Yes"
"22230","2113","Unnamed Jefferson Townsman","Unnamed Jefferson Townsman","","<p>In a strange anticipation of its own narrative, <em>Light in August</em> introduces this ""acquaintance"" who lives ""in the town"" and who tells the ""stranger"" who has noticed the sign in front of Hightower's house a very abbreviated version of the story of Reverend Hightower, his wife, and his twenty-five years in Jefferson (59-60).  Two pages later the part of the stranger new to Jefferson will be played by Byron Bunch and the same story will be told to him in greater detail by ""them,"" a collective town-as-narrator (60-73).</p>","Yes"
"22229","2112","Unnamed Jefferson Driver","Unnamed Jefferson Driver","","<p>This is ""the man behind the wheel"" of the car in which Christmas is driven from Mottstown to Jefferson in <em>Light in August</em>; he keeps the engine running while the officers go into the jail to get him (356).</p>","Yes"

"22224","2107","Unnamed Four Boys","Unnamed Four Boys","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> these ""boys in identical overalls, who live within a three mile radius"" of the McEachern farm,"" are ""fourteen and fifteen"" years old when, with Joe, they arrange to have sex with a Negro girl in a deserted sawmill shed (156).

Although the white people of Yoknapatawpha had avoided Joanna's place for decades, within minutes after her corpse is discovered in the burning house a huge crowd gathers there.  It is comprised mostly of white men (who, the narrator pointedly says, ""would not have allowed their wives"" to call on Joanna while she lived there, 291-92), although the crowd includes ""the women"" too (289).  Some are country people coming past in wagons on their way ""to spend Saturday"" in town, some come ""afoot from the immediate neighborhood,"" and some, probably most, drive in cars out to the fire from Jefferson (287).  Among these townspeople, the narrator obliquely includes members of the middle class: storekeepers and professionals like ""lawyers"" and ""doctors"" (289).  Since elsewhere the novel says that Joanna's ""neighborhood"" is ""populated, when at all, by negroes"" (258), the fact that the crowd includes people ""from the immediate neighborhood"" suggests it includes some blacks, although since the description of it contains phrases like ""faces identical with one another"" and notes that ""they"" call the killer a ""<em>black son of a </em>"" (291) and in the past called his victim a ""Nigger lover"" (292), it is obviously almost entirely white.  The fire and murder and possibility of rape are, for all of them, ""an emotional barbeque"" that provides a break from ""monotonous days"" (294).  Some in the crowd carry ""pistols in their pockets"" and are looking for ""someone to crucify"" (289), which suggests the latent lynch mob that seems to lurk behind this sensation-hungry crowd.

They aren't secret enough to keep her from becoming a scandalous topic among the women in her husband's church. She commits suicide in Memphis after jumping from the window of the hotel room where she and a man had registered under ""a fictitious name"" (67).  In the room from which she jumped, in one of the more tantalizing moments in the fictions, ""the police found her rightful name where she had written it herself on a piece of paper and then torn it up and thrown it into the waste basket"" (67).  This ""rightful name"" may just be ""Hightower,"" as opposed to that ""fictitious"" one.

"22155","3019","Joe Christmas","Christmas, Joe","Milly Hines, Unnamed Father of Joe Christmas","<p>Joe Christmas' story is the most developed of the various narrative lines in <em>Light in August</em>, though at its center is the unresolvable question of his racial identity.  The novel refers to his skin more than once as ""parchmentcolored"" (120), but race in the world of the novel is defined by the (hypothetical) color of one's ""blood,"" as black or white.  Joe is not definitively one or the other.  He is the illegitimate son of Milly Hines and a circus worker of uncertain lineage, left at Christmas time anonymously at an orphanage in Memphis by his grandfather, Doc Hines. When his racial identity comes into question, he is placed in the home of Simon McEachern. Later he apparently kills McEachern and moves around the country on ""the street which was to run for fifteen years"" (223). Many of his most violent experiences are grounded in his unsubstantiated belief that he has ""some nigger blood"" (196) and in pathological ambivalence toward women that dates from a traumatic moment in the orphanage when he was ""five"" (120).  Arriving in Jefferson at age thirty-three, he enters into a complex intimate relationship with Joanna Burden, which after three years deteriorates suddenly and ends violently, making him a fugitive - and ultimately a the victim of a lynching.  Throughout he carries a heavy thematic 'burden' himself, as an ambiguous Christ-figure, a study in alienation, and a way for Faulkner to open up the issue of race.</p>","Yes"

"22153","3017","Mrs. Hines","Hines, Mrs.","","<p>Mrs. Hines, the mother of Milly and grandmother of Joe Christmas, is described in <em>Light in August</em> as ""a dumpy, fat little woman with a round face like dirty and unovened dough, and a tight screw of scant hair"" (346).  Early on, she is a much less vivid character than her dominating husband, whose religious fanaticism seems to control them both. Later, after she realizes that Joe Christmas is the grandson whom her husband had taken from her thirty-five years earlier, she takes charge of her husband, manages to visit Joe in jail, and seeks assistance on Joe's behalf.</p>","Yes"

He and Milly are together long enough for her to get pregnant.  His legacy to his son, who is given the name Joe Christmas in the Memphis orphanage, is the mystery of his own racial identity.  Doc Hines is convinced he is a Negro, i.e. in the racist world of segregation, has ""nigger blood"" (374).  Milly apparently tries to tell her parents ""the man is a Mexican"" (374).

While in Jefferson, for six days every week he is a steady, dependable worker in the mill; every Sunday he directs a country church choir.  Scrupulously honest with himself and others, Byron is also a sweet-tempered man.  When Lena Grove appears at the mill in search of Lucas Burch, Byron instantly and ""contrary to all the tradition of his austere and jealous country raising"" (49) falls in love with her; at first, his love disrupts the pattern of his previous life as he becomes her self-appointed protector; at last, although the ending of his story remains open, it seems that love enables him to escape the past - something that seldom happens in Faulkner's fictions.</p>","Yes"

She tells people about ""her second marriage and her husband's death"" (381), but it seems most likely that this husband is a figment of Miss Zilphia's imagination and a way to explain that child.  In any case, just like the painter whom Zilphia <em>did</em> marry, he's never given a name, and so effectively she remains 'Miss Zilphia' - the name the narrator uses throughout.</p>","No"

His last name is never given, so we cannot know Zilphia's married name.  Her husband is described as ""a young man with black hair and eyes like wood ashes"" (375).  Despite his own prejudice against any ""woman that wore glasses"" (377), he falls in love with Zilphia, and vows to her to ""get you out of"" the miserable life her mother forces her to live (376).  Like a knight, he stands several vigils over her, but though he marries her he cannot succeed in carrying her away from Mrs. Gant.  Some time after he leaves Jefferson he marries again ""in a neighboring state"" (379), and has at least one child, but is killed by a car outside the hospital where his wife has died giving birth to a daughter (381).</p>","Yes"

The cues provided by the text, however, make it probable that this girl (whom the narrator calls ""little Zilphia,"" 381) is the daughter of the painter Zilphia married many years earlier and his second wife: for example, the girl has ""eyes like wood ashes and dark hair,"" both traits she shares with that husband (381, 375).

"22122","2086","Mrs. Gant","Gant, Mrs.","","<p>Mrs. Gant is probably the most powerfully drawn character in the story named after her daughter, ""Miss Zilphia Gant,"" just as she is an overwhelming force in Zilphia's life, even long after she is dead.  At the story's start she is ""a hale, not-old woman with a broad, strong face"" who hunts down and kills her husband and the woman for whom he abandoned her ""with the capability of a man [and] the pertinacity of a Fate"" (370); thereafter she moves into town, where she becomes a successful dressmaker and businesswoman - though as a mother she grows increasingly possessive of her daughter, becoming in the course of the story both crazier and more masculine: ""growing into the outward semblance of a man until now at forty there was a faint shadow of a moustache at the corner of her mouth"" (373).  This ""gaunt, manlike woman"" (376) wears her dressmaker's costume (""oil cloth sewing apron"" and ""bosom festooned with threaded needles,"" 371) like a uniform or suit of armor; she dies sitting up in a chair, ""erect and fully dressed,"" next to the shotgun she carries like a prison guard (378).</p>","Yes"

He is the father of Miss Zilphia, though he abandons her and her mother when she was a ""two-year-old girl"" (369), and disappears from the narrative after he and his lover are killed not far from the Memphis markets by his wife, who tracks them down.  According to the Yoknapatawpha farmers who see Zilphia in Jefferson, Jim's promiscuity accounts for the bars on her window: as one puts it, ""I reckon Mrs. Gant ain't taking no risk"" with her daughter's chastity (371).</p>","Yes"

The short story describes her as ""high yellow"" (i.e. light-skinned, 160); the novel just refers to her as ""young"" (16).  In both texts, Turl seems to have no trouble seducing her.</p>","Yes"

More cipher than character, this man's presence solidifies the town's opinion that the source of Flem's success in Jefferson is his beautiful wife.  (Elsewhere in the fictions, when Flem moves on from the restaurant he puts a relative, one of his many 'cousins,' in it, but there's no indication that this ""manager"" is Flem's kin.)</p>","Yes"

In <em>The Hamlet</em> Suratt's partner is named Aaron Rideout, Suratt's brother-in law, whereas in the <em>The Town</em> he's Grover Cleveland Winbush.

In <em>The Mansion</em>'s reference to this episode in the town's - and Flem's - history, both these men are referred to together as ""them two mad skeered Negro firemen"" (183).  In the first two texts Turl is well-known locally for his amorous adventures: as the short story puts it, he has ""prowled at least once (or tried to) every gal within ten miles of town"" (160).  It is his dangerous but comically portrayed affair with Tom-Tom's wife that creates the 'centaur' of the title.  (In <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, published 15 years before <em>The Town</em>, ""Tomey's Turl"" is the name of the enslaved, illegitimate and incestuously conceived character from whom all the black Beauchamps descend; he was born in 1833, whereas the Tomey's Turl in <em>The Town</em> must have been born after 1880.

Hoxey is described the town's ""lone rich middle-aged bachelor"" and ""a graduate of Yale"" (151).

In both the story and the novel he serves as a source of the story of Flem Snopes' effort to embezzle by turning the plant's two Negro firemen against each other.  His attitude toward the events is mostly that of a bemused spectator, though in the novel's re-telling of the episode he actively intervenes to help the two Negroes recognize that their real antagonist is the white Snopes.</p>","Yes"
"22083","2049","Unnamed Boys at Airfield","Unnamed Boys at Airfield","","<p>In ""Death Drag,"" these boys are the first to appear at the airfield when the barnstormers land there after having performed a stunt over the town. They are curious about the airplane and the aviators and ask questions that the adults can't or won't.  Noticing that ""two of the strangers were of a different race from themselves,"" one asks the ""limping man"" who turns out to be Ginsfarb,  ""Were you in the war?"" (188).  They accompany barnstormers into town, where a boy repeats the question, assuming that the limp is the result of a war injury (192).</p>","Yes"

"22081","2047","Unnamed Spectators at Air Show","Unnamed Spectators at Air Show","","<p>The people in the ""good crowd"" (198) watching the barnstorming show in ""Death Drag"" react variously to what happens, especially at its aborted climax:  some express disbelief and shock; some of the women faint.  Children are also present, and there's a mix of town and country people.  One ""countrywoman"" is repeatedly and vocally skeptical about the authenticity of the show:  ""You can't tell me"" this or that, she says, but is last heard demanding to be taken ""right home this minute"" when the show's final stunt goes wrong (199-200).</p>","Yes"

"22079","2045","Ginsfarb","Ginsfarb","","<p>In ""Death Drag"" Ginsfarb is the barnstorming wing walker who performs the aerobatic stunts suggested by the story's title.  His characterization emphasizes his Jewish ethnicity, sometimes in very stereotypical ways.  Although he is a ""short man,"" his ""nose"" would ""have fitted a six-foot body"" (187); he is so greedy for money that he can't be trusted to negotiate with the small towns the team performs in: ""he'd stick out for his price too long"" and so might well attract the attention of ""anybody that might catch them"" running the illegal show (195, 194).  His favorite expression of disgust is ""Gruss Gott"" (""great God""); the phrase and his ""vaudeville"" accent (187) suggest that he is perhaps a first-generation immigrant.  The narrative contrasts him in several ways with the aviators it admires: unlike Captain Warren, he wasn't injured in a war but in an airborne argument over the amount of his fee; his hatred of flying contrasts with Jock's obsessive love of it.  But there is no questioning the courage he shows in the extremely dangerous stunts he performs, and the risks he runs could be seen as legitimizing his insistence on being paid more for doing them.  The narrator says ""he has the most tragic face we had ever seen"" (187).</p>","Yes"

Although the exact nature of Basket's relationship with Doom is unclear, he is a confidant of the chief.  As a Chickasaw in the later story ""A Courtship,"" where ""Herman Basket's sister"" and ""Herman Basket's aunt"" are central characters, he himself appears directly only once,  when he asks his sister's suitors to ""be reasonable"" (368).

These modern young people know only modern aircraft and not the history of the unstable planes, like the Sopwith Camel, that the pilots flew thirteen years earlier in the war.

This list seems to summarize his rise through the ranks during the War, though not every term is clear.  ""Ack emma"" was a common abbreviation during the War among British troops for ""a.m."" - morning - though what it means in reference to a young pilot is obscure.  ""M.C."" almost certainly refers to the British 'Military Cross,' a medal awarded for 'an act or acts of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy' - though historically he should have received a 'D.F.C,"" the 'Distinguished Flying Cross.'

Although nothing more is said about the tailor, the sentence provides an interesting juxtaposition of the upper class clothing he wore when off duty and these ""overalls.""

Spoomer's snobbery is displayed when he tells his dog not to eat the trash behind the enlisted men's mess hall:  ""You mustn't eat that stuff,"" he says; ""That's for soldiers"" (519).  Spoomer also uses his rank to impress women; he has taken one from Sartoris before the story begins.  He also pulls rank on Sartoris to keep him from seeing 'Toinette in Amiens by giving him ""some duty not in his province at all and which would keep him on the aerodrome for the afternoon"" (519).

His letter to Aunt Jenny about Sartoris' death reveals him to be a compassionate man but even more, a very military one.  Calling Sartoris Jenny's son instead of her great-nephew, he writes that ""The E.A. outnumbered your son and had more height and speed which is our misfortune but no fault of the Government which would give us better machines if they had them which is no satisfaction to you"" (530).

"22033","1999","Ffollansbye","Ffollansbye","","<p>Ffollansbye, a British officer who also appears in Faulkner's non-Yoknapatawpha short story ""Thrift,"" is the source of much of what the narrator of ""All the Dead Pilots"" tells us about Sartoris and Spoomer.  He doesn't seem to be a malicious gossip so much as a sardonic one.  For example, commenting on Spoomer's Mons Star, an honor awarded for service in France or Belgium, he says, ""it was one decoration you had to be on hand to get"" (513), implying that Spoomer's uncle is responsible for his other honors.</p>","No"

"22031","1997","Unnamed Negro outside Jail","Unnamed Negro outside Jail","","<p>This is the ""someone"" in ""The Hound"" to whom one of the Negroes in jail is yelling through the window (163).  It could just as easily be a woman as a man, but while the race is not specified, other Yoknapatawpha fictions, in which friends and family of black prisoners often gather outside the same window - not to mention the etiquette of Jim Crow segregation, which makes it unlikely that a Negro in jail would be yelling at a white person -  explain why we assume this ""someone"" is also black.</p>","Yes"
"22030","1996","Unnamed Negro Who Finds Gun","Unnamed Negro Who Finds Gun","","<p>In ""The Hound"" the clerk named Snopes tells Cotton that the man who found his shotgun in the slough where he tried to hide it was ""a nigger squirl hunter"" (159).  When Faulkner re-tells this story in <em>The Hamlet</em>, Cotton is named Mink Snopes, the clerk is named Lump Snopes, and the Negro who ""found that durn gun"" is fishing instead of hunting - actually, he is ""grabbling,"" in which you try to catch the fish under water with your bare hands (257).  In this second version Lump also tells Mink that he is planning to ""take a few of the boys"" and punish the Negro violently for informing the sheriff about his discovery (258), though that part of the story is never told.</p>","Yes"

He is described as ""past middle-age,"" ""a fat, slow man in denim trousers and a collarless white shirt"" who smokes a corn cob pipe (156).  At first he seems more concerned with his ""supper"" than with investigating Houston's disappearance (158), but that seems at least in part a disguise.  He figures out how to identify and capture the killer, and transports him to jail with both professional care and human respect, while making sure that they eat on the way and also will be ""home for supper"" on time (163).  (When Faulkner re-tells this story in <em>The Hamlet</em>, the killer is a Snopes, and the sheriff who captures him ""Hub"" or ""Hope Hampton.""

"22028","1994","Ernest Cotton","Cotton, Ernest","","<p>Ernest Cotton is a bachelor and an unsuccessful farmer whose hapless attempt to avenge himself against a more prosperous neighbor is at the center of ""The Hound.""

He is also a murderer and would-be suicide, though unsuccessful at those as well.

Their role in <em>The Hamlet</em> is the largest of the four.  They court her for several years, ""week and week and Sunday and Sunday"" (148), during which time they are jealous rivals of each other until an outsider, an itinerant salesman, appears, and then they band together to drive him away.  They cannot drive off Hoake McCarron, even though five of them ""bushwack"" him as he drives Eula home in <em>The Town</em>.  After it is discovered that Eula is pregnant, two of them leave Yoknapatawpha hastily (though Hoake is the father of the child she carries; these two flee, the narrator of <em>The Hamlet</em> says, in ""glorious shame of the ruin they did not do,"" (156).

"22019","1986","Unnamed People of Division","Unnamed People of Division","","<p>The people who live in the small hamlet of Division are one of the sources of information about the Starnes family that the narrator of ""Hair"" draws on. Once all the Starneses have died, these residents expect the Starnes' Alabama kin to claim the house.

"22014","1981","Mrs. Will Starnes","Starnes, Mrs. Will","","<p>Mrs. Starnes, mother of Sophie Starnes, becomes widowed after Will Starnes dies. He leaves her with a mortgage on the house in Division that Stribling (Hawkshaw) promises to pay off. Although the narrator refers the Starnes as ""backwoods folks"" (139), Mrs. Starnes believes her family's status is nonetheless superior to Stribling's (she calls him ""one of these parveynoos"" [140], i.e. parvenus).

"22013","1980","Susan Reed","Reed, Susan","","<p>Susan Reed is an orphan who is taken care of by the Burchett family in ""Hair""; possibly she is their niece or cousin, but the narrator hints that she may be the illegitimate child of either Mr. or Mrs. Burchett. We first encounter her as a ""thin little girl,"" ""about five"" years old, with ""big scared eyes,"" and ""straight, soft hair, not blonde and not brunette"" (131). Once she reaches adolescence, however, her innocent look disappears and she becomes  promiscuous, with ""flimsy off-color clothes"" and a ""face watchful and bold and discreet all at once"" (135). She starts ""using rouge and paint"" (134), drops out of school, and, according to narrator, sleeps with ""schoolboys, married men, anybody"" (135) - making her a minor member of the gallery of sexually active young women who appear in Faulkner's early fiction.  Unlike the rest of them, however, she ends up married and, we can hope, living happily ever after.

"22011","1978","Matt Fox","Fox, Matt","","<p>The narrator of ""Hair"" says Matt Fox, a barber at Maxey's barber shop, ""knew more about Hawkshaw than Maxey"" (133), which surprises the narrator because Matt does not talk much.

He is ""funny"" and ""almost as good a barber as Hawkshaw"" (133).</p>","Yes"
"22010","1977","Mitch Ewing","Ewing, Mitch","","<p>In ""Hair"" Mitch Ewing is one of the narrator's sources of information about Hawkshaw.  Because of his job at the railroad station, Ewing knows that Hawkshaw buys a ticket every year to a ""junction-point,""  a station from which ""he can go to Memphis or Birmingham or New Orleans"" (143).

The narrator repeats the local rumor that Susan may be her illegitimate child, but this is never confirmed. Mrs. Burchett seems to be more involved with Susan's care than Mr. Burchett.

"22002","1970","Unnamed Subadar","Unnamed Subadar","","<p>At the time of the story, 'subadar' was a rank roughly equivalent to captain, given to Indian nationals who led Indian troops as part of the British armed forces. The subadar in ""Ad Astra"" identifies himself as a ""prince"" in India, ""my country"" (408).  Before the War, Bland saw him deliver a speech in Oxford, England, a time when the subadar himself says ""I was a white man also for that moment"" (409).  In France he is attached to a battalion of Indian soldiers who serve the British military, probably by relaying British orders to them.  He is well-educated, egalitarian, opposed to warfare and the authorities who insist upon it, and prepared to live as ""an exile"" afterward (427).  On the evening of November 11, 1918, he seems to sum up Faulkner's story when he says: ""What will any of us do? All this generation which fought in the war are dead tonight. But we do not yet know it"" (421). Like the German prisoner, the subadar asserts ""I too will not be baron"" by declining to accept the responsibilities of his caste; he says: ""I undid in one day what it took two thousand years to do. Is not that something?"" (427). He insists to his companions of the evening that ""this life is nothing"" (417).</p>","No"
"22001","1969","Unnamed President of France","Unnamed President of France","","<p>The man the American M.P. in ""Ad Astra"" refers to simply as ""your president"" when he's arguing with the French officer is Raymond Poincare, who was President of France during World War I.</p>","No"

"21999","1967","Unnamed Patronne","Unnamed Patronne","","<p>The patronne in ""Ad Astra"" is the manager and owner of the Cloche-Clos.  An old woman who wears steel spectacles and knits, she thoroughly understands the threat posed to her business by the Allied aviators and their German prisoner.  She loudly expresses her outrage that this German - whom she calls a ""Boche!"" (422) - has been brought into her bistro: ""Eight months since the obus I have kept them in a box against this day: plates, cups, saucers, glasses, all that I have had since thirty years, all gone, broken at one time! And it costing me fifty centimes the glass for such that I shame myself to have my patrons - "" (422).  (Obus is French for artillery shell; it seems she uses the term to refer to the time, eight months earlier, when the Germans began bombarding Amiens, and a shell destroyed the tools of her trade.)</p>","No"
"21998","1966","Unnamed Military Mechanics","Unnamed Military Mechanics","","<p>According to the narrator of ""Ad Astra,"" two military mechanics were required to ""shoehorn"" the exceptionally large Comyn ""into the cockpit of a Dolphin, like two chambermaids putting an emergency bolster into a case too large for it"" (410).  (The Sopwith Dolphin was one of the standard British fighter planes during the First World War.)</p>","No"
"21997","1965","Unnamed Indian Troops","Unnamed Indian Troops","","<p>The Indian subadar in ""Ad Astra"" refers to the colonial troops brought to Europe from India to fight for England during the First World War as ""my people"" (424).  It needs to be said, however, that as they are described, they are not people so much as stereotypes, and the racial assumptions behind the stereotypes are clearly Faulkner's.  The subadar also calls them ""children"" (425), who thought of the rifles they were issued as ""spears"" (424).  When a ""whole battalion"" went into battle without loading those rifles, less than twenty survived (425).  (Over one million members of the Indian Army fought with the Allies in World War I, including 130,000 in France and Belgium.)</p>","No"

Born into a noble family in Prussia as the oldest of four brothers, he repudiated his hereditary title.  He studies music at the university in Bayreuth, marries a woman beneath his privileged class, and fathers a child with her. Over time, however, the loss of each of his three younger brothers sends him back to military service. On the morning of November 11, his mother writes him with the news that his youngest brother has been assassinated and he himself is now the Baron.  He attempts to escape that, but his suicidal final flight fails when he survives the crash of his plane.  He remains philosophical about his own and Germany's defeats.  In his conversations with the subadar, he offers the idea that his break with his family tradition is a significant gesture towards brotherhood, but he himself becomes the object of a barroom brawl when his captors insist on displaying him to the local French.</p>","No"
"21990","1958","Unnamed German Patrol Leader","Unnamed German Patrol Leader","","<p>Apparently this aviator in ""Ad Astra,"" whom the narrator refers to as the ""Hun patrol leader,"" was the pilot who shot down Sartoris' brother's plane (414).  He may in turn have been shot down by Sartoris; Hume says that Sartoris ""must have got him"" during the week he spends in the sky seeking to avenge his brother, but as the narrator says, ""we didn't know"" if the enemy pilot Sartoris shot down was the one he was after (414).

He feels no obligation to serve his family, and according to his oldest brother, he ""did nothing in Berlin"" (417). Although he comes home to be assume the title of Baron, his brother continues: ""he does not stay at home. In 1912 he iss in Berlin newspaper dead of a lady's husband"" (418).  It seems likely that the ""lady"" is this man's mistress.</p>","No"
"21987","1955","Unnamed German Lady","Unnamed German Lady","","<p>It seems apparent in ""Ad Astra"" that this Berlin woman is having an affair with one of the German prisoner's twin brothers; according to the captive, at least, in 1912 his brother is reported in the Berlin newspapers as ""dead of a lady's husband"" (418).  This is the extent of her appearance in this story.</p>","No"
"21986","1954","Unnamed German Kaiser","Unnamed German Kaiser","","<p>The ""kaiser"" whom the German aviator refers to without naming in ""Ad Astra"" is Kaiser Wilhelm II (Friedrich Wilhelm Victor Albert von Hohenzollern); he ruled Germany as emperor from June 1888 to November 9, 1918. On that date, having lost the support of the army, he abdicated, and fled the country a day later.

"21983","1951","Unnamed German Aviators 1","Unnamed German Aviators 1","","<p>This group is more like a casualty statistic than a character.  The World War I aviators in ""Ad Astra"" keep track of their successes by counting each enemy plane they shoot down as a ""Hun"": thus  Sartoris shoots down ""three Huns"" in his quest to avenge his brother's death (414), and Monaghan refers to the ""thirteen Huns"" he ""got"" (416).

"21974","1942","Unnamed Allied Aviator 1","Unnamed Allied Aviator 1","","<p>This character is ""the other guy"" in ""Ad Astra"" who was flying with Sartoris' brother when he was shot down (414).  He is serving as a British aviator, presumably in the same ""Camel squadron"" as Sartoris, but given all the non-English aviators in the story, we cannot say where he was from (414).  The Sopwith Camel was a standard single-seat British aircraft during World War I.</p>","No"
"21973","1941","Monaghan, Father of Buck","Monaghan, Father of Buck","Monaghan, Grandfather of Buck","<p>An immigrant to the U.S., Monaghan's father brags about his ""Shanty Irish"" origins, but at the time of ""Ad Astra,"" he is a self-made millionaire who began his rise to wealth by collecting refuse and finally by building municipal sewage systems. Monaghan quotes him: ""When you're with your fine friends, the fathers and mothers and sisters of them you met at Yale, ye might just remind them that every man is the slave of his own refuse and so your old dad they would be sending around to the forty-story back doors of their kitchens is the king of them all"" (415).</p>","No"
"21972","1940","Monaghan, Grandfather of Buck","Monaghan, Grandfather of Buck","","<p>This is one of Faulkner's characters who are defined by absence and indeterminacy.  In ""Ad Astra,"" when the aviator Monaghan explains his ""Shanty Irish"" origins, he gives a memorable description of his father, but he cannot trace his ancestry before that: other than saying his father came ""out of a peat bog,"" which suggests the Irish peasantry, Monaghan claims, ""I don’t know what my grandfather was. I don’t know if I had one. My father don’t remember one. Likely it could have been one of several"" (415).</p>","No"
"21971","1939","Hume","Hume","","<p>The character in ""Ad Astra"" named Hume is probably another Allied aviator, but in the story his role is to narrate the way Sartoris managed to avenge his brother's death.</p>","No"
"21970","1938","Franz","Franz","Unnamed German Baroness, Unnamed German Baron","<p>In ""Ad Astra,"" Franz is the elder of a pair of twins who are younger brothers to the captured German officer. When his older brother refuses to become baron, Franz, as next in line, is passed over because he is already committed to the career of a military officer. Franz becomes baron designate when the younger twin is killed in Berlin by a jealous husband. Franz progresses through the ranks from colonel to ""general of staff"" (419), but near the end of the War is assassinated by a German soldier in Berlin.</p>","No"
"21969","1937","Das","Das","","<p>The name ""Das"" is a common South Asian name, derived from Sanskrit.  One of its meanings, however, is 'servant,' so it may be used by the subadar in ""Ad Astra"" not as a name but as a kind of title or label. In either case, this character is ""the headman"" who supervises the native military personnel; after the battalion's disastrous attack on German lines, he reluctantly admits to the subadar that his troops crossed No Man's Land with unloaded rifles, and almost their entire batallion was annihilated (425).</p>","No"
"21968","1936","Bishop 1","Bishop, William Avery","","<p>William Avery Bishop (1894-1956) led all Canadian aviators during World War I, being credited with shooting down 72 German planes.

"21967","1935","Unnamed Negro Laundresses 2","Unnamed Negro Laundresses 2","","<p>Quentin's narrative in ""That Evening Sun"" begins by evoking the ""Negro women"" who used to carry the clothes they had washed for their white customers in bundles on their heads (289); now they fetch and deliver it in automobiles or have lost their jobs to commercial laundry services.</p>","Yes"
"21966","1934","Unnamed Negro Husbands","Unnamed Negro Husbands","","<p>In the old days described by Quentin's narrative in ""That Evening Sun,"" the husbands of the town's Negro laundresses sometimes ""fetch and deliver"" the clothes their wives have washed (290).</p>","Yes"
"21965","1933","Unnamed Queen","Unnamed Queen","","<p>This ""queen"" is the protagonist of the grim fairy tale that Nancy begins to tell the Compson children (302).  Like Nancy, she ""has to cross a ditch to get into her house quick and bar the door,"" but is afraid of the ""bad man"" who is hiding in the ditch (303).  The question of the racial identity of these characters is not definitively answerable, but given how closely Nancy's tale is drawn from her own immediate life, it seems appropriate to make both the villain and the heroine of it black.  This ""queen"" then is the only upper class Negro character in Faulkner's fiction.</p>","Yes"
"21964","1932","Unnamed Bad Man","Unnamed Bad Man","","<p>This ""bad man"" is the antagonist of the story - a kind of grim fairy tale - that Nancy begins to tell the Compson children (302).  The question of the racial identity of this man, and the ""queen"" who also appears in Nancy's unfinished story, is not definitively answerable, but given how closely Nancy's tale is drawn from her own immediate life, it seems appropriate to make both the villain and the heroine of it black.</p>","Yes"
"21963","1931","Mr. Lovelady","Lovelady, Mr.","","<p>In ""That Evening Sun,"" Nancy tells the Compson children that ""I got my coffin money saved up with Mr. Lovelady"" - or as Quentin's narrative explains, Mr. Lovelady is ""a short, dirty man who collected the Negro insurance, coming around to the cabins or the kitchens every Saturday morning, to collect fifteen cents"" toward a fund to pay for their funerals (308). He lives at the hotel with his wife and only daughter. Though he and his family occupy only part of a paragraph, the details of their story are provocative: Mrs. Lovelady commits suicide, and after leaving town with his daughter, Mr. Lovelady returns a week or two later alone.</p>","Yes"
"21962","1930","Mrs. Lovelady","Lovelady, Mrs.","","<p>Mrs. Lovelady, the wife of the white man who collects insurance money from the local Negroes in ""That Evening Sun,"" commits suicide ""one morning"" (308).  Quentin's narrative gives no further account or explanation of that act.</p>","Yes"

He returns alone, and we learn nothing more about his child's fate.</p>","Yes"
"21960","1928","Aunt Rachel","Rachel, Aunt","","<p>Aunt Rachel never directly appears in ""That Evening Sun.""  Quentin says she is ""old,"" and lives in a cabin ""by herself"" near Nancy, smoking ""a pipe in the door, all day long"" (294).  The ""Aunt"" in her name is clearly conventional, part of the way the Jim Crow culture stereotypes Negroes, but it's not clear whether she is ""Jesus' mother"": ""Sometimes she said she was and sometimes she said she wasn't any kin to Jesus"" (294).  Quentin's father suggests Nancy could ""go to Aunt Rachel's"" for safety, but that doesn't happen (306).</p>","Yes"

Her undress and the location of the building suggest she is a prostitute, but that is not made definite.</p>","No"
"21957","1925","Unnamed Woman in Red Dress","Unnamed Woman in Red Dress","","<p>Among the people attending Red's funeral in <em>Sanctuary</em>, this ""woman in a red dress"" deserves to be singled out.  She plays a role that recurs in Faulkner's fiction: the agent of chaos.  Just as the crowd ""grows quiet"" listening to the orchestra play a hymn, she enters ""unsteadily""; her first word is ""Whoopee"" (245).  Later, her demand that Joe ""get that damn stiff out of here and open the [crap] game,"" accompanied by ""a burst of filthy language"" (248), sets off the violence that brings the funeral literally crashing to an end.</p>","No"

"21952","1920","Unnamed University Men","Unnamed University Men","","<p><em>Sanctuary</em> provides a generic description of the male ""students in the University"" who date Temple on the weekends.

"21951","1919","Unnamed University Dean","Unnamed University Dean","","<p>The administrator in <em>Sanctuary</em> who puts Temple on academic probation ""for slipping out at night,"" i.e. for dating on weeknights, is referred to simply as ""the Dean"" (57) - perhaps the Dean of Women Students.</p>","No"
"21950","1918","Unnamed American Soldier 1","Unnamed American Soldier 1","","<p>This man appears in <em>Sanctuary</em> in the story Ruby tells at two different times, to Temple and and then later to Horace, about how when Lee was stationed in the Philippines he ""killed another soldier"" in a brawl over a local woman (59).</p>","No"

(""Turnkey"" is a fairly archaic term for ""jailor,"" and ""jailor"" is an acceptable alternative spelling for ""jailer.""  According to the ""Corrected Texts"" that Noel Polk edited for Vintage International, Faulkner spelled ""jailer"" with an 'e' in ""That Evening Sun,"" <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, ""An Error in Chemistry"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> but with an 'o' in <em>Sanctuary</em>, ""Monk"" and <em>The Reivers</em>.  ""Jailer"" is more standard in American usage, so we use that spelling for all DY's Cumulative Character names, but preserve ""jailor"" in the individual Character entries for the second set of texts.))</p>","No"
"21948","1916","Unnamed Tulane Student","Unnamed Tulane Student","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em>, as he tells the men at the Old Frenchman place about his troubles with Little Belle's behavior, Horace mentions a young man whom she apparently met on the train coming ""home from school"" four days before the novel begins (14).  She defends her relationship with him by telling Horace that ""he goes to Tulane"" (14).  Though Horace's objectivity on the subject of Little Belle is not to be trusted, this particular unnamed young man seems to be one of several or perhaps many whom she has brought home; Horace sums them up as ""Louis or Paul or Whoever"" (13).</p>","No"

"21938","1906","Unnamed Suitors of Little Belle","Unnamed Suitors of Little Belle","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Horace refers to the various young men who have been calling on his step-daughter Little Belle as ""Louis or Paul or Whoever"" (13).  Horace seems to believe there have been many such suitors, ""alert and a little impatient,"" sharing the hammock in the grape arbor with her in ways he finds very disconcerting (13-14), but Horace's ideas about Belle's sexuality are hardly reliable.</p>","No"
"21937","1905","Unnamed Store Clerks","Unnamed Store Clerks","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em>, in order to try to find out where Narcissa went after he sees her in ""disappear into a door"" in town, Horace asks all the clerks ""within the radius of where she must have turned"" if they've seen her (261).</p>","Yes"

"21935","1903","Unnamed Spectators in Courtroom 1","Unnamed Spectators in Courtroom 1","","<p><em>Sanctuary</em> describes the people who watch Lee Goodwin's trial from Horace's perspective as he enters the courtroom.  From this point of view they are a collection of ""heads"": ""bald heads, gray heads, shaggy heads and heads trimmed to recent feather-edge above sun-baked necks, oiled heads above urban collars and here and there a sunbonnet or a flowered hat"" (281).

"21931","1900","Unnamed Rich Woman","Unnamed Rich Woman","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em>, the woman who owns the limousine in which Popeye's grandmother leaves him becomes a kind of godmother to the child, making sure Popeye gets medical attention and often bringing him ""to her home in afternoons and for holidays"" (308).  The narrative does not explain her motives in trying to help, but does show how they come to grief when her attempt to give him a birthday party is defeated by his violent antisocial behavior.  Even after Popeye is sent to ""a home for incorrigible children"" (309), this woman continues to help Popeye's mother support herself (309).</p>","No"
"21930","1899","Unnamed People in Oxford 2","Unnamed People in Oxford 2","","<p><em>Sanctuary</em> refers generically to the various residents of Oxford who see Temple in the evenings, as she hurries to or from a date.

"21929","1898","Unnamed People in Downtown Memphis 1","Unnamed People in Downtown Memphis 1","","<p>Chapter 21 of <em>Sanctuary</em> describes the various people whom Virgil and Fonzo see in the train station and on the streets of Memphis when they arrive in the city.  None are given any individuality, but they are identified as ""a stream of people"" who ""jostle"" the newcomers in the depot, where they are also beset by cabmen and a redcap, and, in the Hotel Gayoso and another, unnamed hotel, a porter, bellboys, and ""people sitting among the potted plants"" in hotel lobbies (188-90).

"21928","1897","Unnamed Residents of Memphis' Restricted District","Unnamed Residents of Memphis' Restricted District","","<p><em>Sanctuary</em> describes the people who live in ""the restricted district"" of Memphis through which Red's funeral procession passes in terms of their ""faces,"" which ""peer from beneath lowered shades"" as it goes by (249).  While it is not absolutely clear what ""restricted district"" refers to, the point of this passage seems to be to juxtapose two worlds in Memphis: the underworld and the respectable (but intimidated) citizenry.</p>","No"
"21927","1896","Unnamed Post Office Clerk","Unnamed Post Office Clerk","","<p>The man who works as a clerk in the university branch of the post office in <em>Sanctuary</em> is described as ""young,"" with a ""dull face,"" ""horn[-rimmed] glasses"" and ""meticulous"" hair (171).

"21926","1895","Unnamed Memphis Commissioner 1","Unnamed Memphis Commissioner 1","","<p>Miss Reba's description of the police commissioner who patronizes her brothel in <em>Sanctuary</em> is memorable: ""a man fifty years old, seven foot tall, with a head like a peanut"" (143).  Her description of his behavior with one of her prostitute is even more unforgettable: when his cronies broke into the room ""they found him buck-nekkid, dancing the highland fling"" (143).</p>","No"
"21925","1894","Unnamed People outside Dumfries","Unnamed People outside Dumfries","","<p>As Popeye and Temple approach the town of Dumfries in <em>Sanctuary</em>, they begin seeing other people on the road, though the narrative refers to them in a complex series of phrases.  In some cases it cites the means of transportation rather than the people: ""pleasure cars Sunday-bent,"" ""Fords and Chevrolets,"" ""now and then a wagon or a buggy"" (139).  The only occupants specifically mentioned are ""swathed women"" in the ""occasional larger car"" and ""wooden-faced country people"" in trucks (139).</p>","No"
"21924","1893","Unnamed Negro Servant in Pensacola","Unnamed Negro Servant in Pensacola","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> this servant works for the unnamed wealthy woman who befriends Popeye's mother.  She is not specifically referred to as a Negro, but since nearly all the domestic servants in the fictions are black, we have chosen to identify her that way.</p>","No"
"21923","1892","Unnamed Pensacola Policeman","Unnamed Pensacola Policeman","","<p>The policeman in <em>Sanctuary</em> from whom Popeye's grandmother asks for a match thinks her irrational statements (including the ominous ""I bring down the house"") are a deliberate effort at humor (307).

"21918","1887","Unnamed Parisian Beggars","Unnamed Parisian Beggars","","<p>During Horace's first conversation with Lee Goodwin in his jail cell, the child that Ruby is holding is compared by the narrator of <em>Sanctuary</em> to ""the children which beggars on Paris streets carry"" (116).  Horace has been to France, and is carrying a French novel when the novel begins.  The novel's final scene is set in Paris.  Still, in the immediate context of the narrow cell that confines Goodwin, the narrative's sudden evocation of life half a world away from Yoknapatawpha comes as a surprise.</p>","No"
"21917","1886","Unnamed Parisian Band","Unnamed Parisian Band","","<p>The musicians that Temple and her father listen to in the Luxembourg Gardens in <em>Sanctuary</em> are dressed ""in the horizon blue of the army"" - suggesting they may be a military band, but that is not stated - and play Massenet, Scriabin and Berlioz (316).</p>","No"

"21915","1884","Unnamed Oxford Town Boys","Unnamed Oxford Town Boys","","<p>The three ""town boys"" who appear as individuals in Chapter 4 of <em>Sanctuary</em> have separate entries.  This entry refers to the aggregate group of young men mentioned in the novel who do not go to the University but do have access to cars which make them desirable dates for Temple on ""week nights,"" between the dances and other weekend social activities on the campus (29).  Excluded at those times, these ""boys"" can only watch Temple from a distance that is socio-economic as well as physical.  For their part, the ""men"" who are ""students in the University"" look down upon the boys, with their ""pomaded heads"" and ""upturned collars"" (29).</p>","No"
"21914","1883","Unnamed Old Woman in Paris","Unnamed Old Woman in Paris","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em>, when Temple and her father sit down ""in the Luxembourg Gardens"" in Paris, this ""old woman"" comes to them ""with decrepit promptitude"" to collect the money - four sous - for the seats (316).</p>","No"

"21909","1878","Unnamed Negro Waitress","Unnamed Negro Waitress","","<p>All <em>Sanctuary</em> says about this waitress is that Minnie's husband ""went off"" with her sometime before the novel begins (210).</p>","No"
"21908","1877","Unnamed Negro Prostitutes","Unnamed Negro Prostitutes","","<p>The prostitutes who work at the less expensive Memphis brothel to which Clarence takes Virgil and Fonzo in <em>Sanctuary</em> are described as ""coffee-colored"" (199).

"21906","1875","Unnamed Negro Murderer","Unnamed Negro Murderer","","<p><em>Sanctuary</em> does not name this man, except as the ""murderer"" (114) who is awaiting his execution in the jail when Goodwin is locked up there.  He killed his wife with a razor.  According to another unnamed black character, he is the ""bes ba'ytone singer in nawth Mississippi!""

"21904","1873","Unnamed Negro Hotel Porter","Unnamed Negro Hotel Porter","","<p>The ""negro porter of the hotel"" where Ruby stays in <em>Sanctuary</em> (135) briefly appears in three separate scenes: showing Ruby to her room in Chapter 16, fetching Horace to the hotel in Chapter 17, and showing Horace where he can wait for a train in Chapter 29.

"21903","1872","Unnamed Negro Yardman 2","Unnamed Negro Yardman 2","","<p>The man who works in ""the yard"" of the Memphis orphanage in <em>Light in August</em> is never named, and appears in the novel only through the story that Doc Hines tells Hightower in Jefferson (383).  But when, according to Hines' story, the young Joe Christmas asks him ""How come you are a nigger?"" (383) his anger is memorable and the response he makes is portentous.  Though at first he calls Christmas a ""little white trash bastard,"" he adds, ""You are worse than that.  You dont know what you are.  And more than that, you wont never know . . ."" (384).</p>","No"
"21902","1871","Unnamed Negro Yardman 1","Unnamed Negro Yardman 1","","<p>When Temple thinks about her father ""sitting on the porch at home"" in <em>Sanctuary</em>, she imagines that he is ""watching a negro mow the lawn"" (51).</p>","No"
"21901","1870","Unnamed Mourners at Red's Funeral","Unnamed Mourners at Red's Funeral","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> two of the people in attendance at Red's funeral - ""middle-aged women"" (246) - are described ""weeping quietly,"" but most seem mainly interested in the free alcohol Gene is providing and in getting the flowers off the crap table so that gambling can resume.  They include men in both ""dark suits"" and ""the light, bright shades of spring,"" and women, the ""younger ones"" wearing ""bright colors"" and the older ones ""in sober gray and black and navy blue, and glittering with diamonds"" (243).  These last remind the narrator, with his habit of juxtaposing genteel and sordid worlds, of ""housewives on a Sunday afternoon excursion"" (243).  This group also includes the person referred to as ""the second man,"" who wants the orchestra to play jazz (244), and the ""four men"" who attack the club's bouncer when he tries to eject the ""woman in red"" (247-48).</p>","No"
"21900","1869","Unnamed Middle-Aged Women","Unnamed Middle-Aged Women","","<p>On the train to Oxford in <em>Sanctuary</em> are ""three middle-aged women"" who cannot find seats, because of the ""gay rudeness"" of the college students who pushed into the car ahead of them (169).</p>","No"
"21899","1868","Unnamed Mexican Girls","Unnamed Mexican Girls","","<p><em>Sanctuary</em> refers to these women at a double remove: Horace is at the Sartoris place when he tells the story of Lee Goodwin at the Old Frenchman place telling him about the ""Mexican girls"" he met while serving as a sergeant in the U.S. cavalry (109).</p>","No"
"21898","1867","Unnamed Jefferson Merchants and Professionals 1","Unnamed Jefferson Merchants and Professionals 1","","<p>When Horace goes downtown on his second day in Jefferson in <em>Sanctuary</em>, he renews his acquaintance with the men he meets around the courthouse: ""merchants and professional men,"" most of whom ""remembered him as a boy"" (112).  They are not otherwise characterized.</p>","Yes"
"21897","1866","Unnamed Men in Square 1","Unnamed Men in Square 1","","<p><em>Sanctuary</em> refers to men in the town square several times.  In Chapter 17 they are seen ""drifting back toward the square after supper"" (134).  In Chapter 19, looking through the window of Ruby's hotel room, Horace can see ""men pitching dollars back and forth between holes in the bare earth beneath and locusts and water oaks"" around the courthouse at the center of the square (161).</p>","Yes"
"21896","1865","Unnamed People at Train Station 1","Unnamed People at Train Station 1","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> the men lounging at the Taylor station who watch Temple as she gets off the train are ""chewing slowly"" (presumably tobacco) and wearing overalls (36).</p>","No"
"21895","1864","Unnamed Garage Workers 1","Unnamed Garage Workers 1","","<p>Although <em>Sanctuary</em> refers to them at one point as ""the garage men"" (127), the ""white men sitting in titled chairs along the oil-foul wall of the garage across the street"" from the jail during the day are associated with only two activities: listening to the convicted murderer sing and chewing, presumably tobacco (115).</p>","Yes"
"21894","1863","Unnamed Negro Hotel Porter in Memphis","Unnamed Negro Hotel Porter in Memphis","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> this porter at the door of the Hotel Gayoso offers to carry Virgil and Fonzo's suitcases, but they ""brush past him"" (190).</p>","No"
"21893","1862","Unnamed Memphis Counterman","Unnamed Memphis Counterman","","<p>As Popeye and Temple drive down the Memphis street toward Miss Reba's in <em>Sanctuary</em>, they see ""a fat man in a dirty apron with a toothpick in his mouth"" inside the diner that they pass (142).</p>","No"
"21892","1861","Tull Family","Tull Family","","<p><em>Sanctuary</em> simply refers to the people eating dinner when Ruby comes in to use the phone as ""Tull's family"" (105).  The story ""Spotted Horses"" (which was published a few months after <em>Sanctuary</em>) is a bit more forthcoming, listing ""his wife and three daughters and Mrs. Tull's aunt.""  On that basis we identify the gender of the family as ""female.""</p>","Yes"
"21891","1860","Unnamed Married Woman 2","Unnamed Married Woman 2","","<p>According to Miss Reba in <em>Sanctuary</em>, among the women who have sought attention from Popeye over the years is ""a little married woman"" who ""offered Minnie twenty-five dollars just to get him into the room"" (145).</p>","No"
"21890","1859","Unnamed Man in Shirt Sleeves","Unnamed Man in Shirt Sleeves","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Horace sees but cannot overhear this ""gesticulant"" man in ""his shirt sleeves"" haranguing the crowd that gathers in front of the jail after Lee Goodwin is convicted (293).  While it seems certain that he is inciting them to violence against Lee, the crowd remains ""quite orderly"" after he finishes ""talking himself out"" (293).</p>","Yes"
"21889","1858","Unnamed Man at Party","Unnamed Man at Party","","<p>Little Belle is at a ""house party"" somewhere when Horace calls her at the end of <em>Sanctuary</em> (299), with someone whom readers only hear, as a ""masculine voice"" who interrupts Belle to try to tell Horace something before Belle ""hushes"" him (300).</p>","No"
"21888","1857","Unnamed Man outside Reba's 1","Unnamed Man outside Reba's 1","","<p>Standing outside Miss Reba's brothel in <em>Sanctuary</em>, Virgil and Fonzo see this man get out of a taxi with a ""plump blonde woman"" (192).  The couple's behavior outside the door causes Fonzo to suck in his breath, and Virgil to assume that they must be married, but while the narrator never says so explicitly, it's clear enough that she is a prostitute and he is one of her customers.  He leaves in the taxi after dropping her off at the house.</p>","No"
"21887","1856","Unnamed Man outside Reba's 2","Unnamed Man outside Reba's 2","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Temple sees ""a man in a cap"" twice when she leaves Miss Reba's to make a phone call (228).  The first time he is ""standing in a door[way]"" (228), and it seems fairly certain (without being made explicit) that he is a confederate of Popeye who is there to keep an eye on her.</p>","No"
"21886","1855","Unnamed Lynch Mob","Unnamed Lynch Mob","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> within a few hours after Lee is convicted - formally for Tommy's murder, and in the minds of the townspeople for Temple's rape - the crowd that gathers in the Square turns into a lynch mob of ""antic"" figures who burn him to death (296).  We see the confused scene through Horace's eyes.  He registers running men, ""panting shouts,"" a ""circle"" that has gathered around a ""blazing mass"" (295-96), but only one member of the mob is individualized: a man ""carrying a five-gallon coal oil can"" which explodes in his hands.  Which members of the community participate in the lynching is not specified, nor does the narrative say anything about the town's larger reaction to the event, but when Horace arrives in Kinston the next day the taxi driver who takes him home says ""they burned that fellow"" approvingly: ""We got to protect our girls"" (298).</p>","Yes"
"21885","1854","Unnamed Locksmith","Unnamed Locksmith","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> this Pensacola locksmith is called in to open the bathroom door that Popeye locked on the day of his birthday party.</p>","No"
"21884","1853","Unnamed Law Professors","Unnamed Law Professors","","<p>Because they felt sorry about his handicap, the unnamed law professors who taught Eustace Graham at the ""State University"" in <em>Sanctuary</em> ""groomed him like a race-horse"" (262).</p>","No"
"21883","1852","Unnamed Drummers 4","Unnamed Drummers 4","","<p>The ""drummers"" in <em>Sanctuary</em> don't actually appear in the novel, but we know they exist because the ""old man"" who picks them up in his taxi when they come to town on the train apparently tells them all the epigram that he has come up with to tell the story of his life (297).  In Faulkner's time (and in his world), a ""drummer"" is a traveling salesman.</p>","No"
"21882","1851","Unnamed Garment Workers","Unnamed Garment Workers","","<p>In an odd aside, <em>Sanctuary</em> notes that the ""suit of gray"" worn by the ""old man"" in Kinston who drives the taxi was ""made by Jews in the New York tenement district"" (298).  Many different ethnicities worked in the city's garment industry and belonged to the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (founded in 1900), but the stereotype of the Jewish garment worker was widespread in the 1920s.</p>","No"
"21881","1850","Unnamed Jackson Prostitutes","Unnamed Jackson Prostitutes","","<p>Listening to State Senator Clarence Snopes talk about the life he leads in the state capital of Jackson in <em>Sanctuary</em>, Horace conjures up images of ""discreet flicks of skirts in swift closet doors"" in various hotel rooms (175).  That's all the narrative gives us, but it seems safe to assume that inside the skirts are women, and that the women themselves are prostitutes.  The narrative makes very clear elsewhere how well Clarence knows his way around the brothels of Memphis - and even his preference for Negro prostitutes, though there's no way to establish the race of the women Horace imagines.</p>","No"
"21880","1849","Unnamed Mourners","Unnamed Mourners","","<p>When she imagines herself dead as a way to escape Popeye's sexual assault in <em>Sanctuary</em>, Temple's fantasy includes ""all the people sitting around the coffin, saying Dont she look sweet"" (219).</p>","No"
"21879","1848","Unnamed Illegitimate Children 1","Unnamed Illegitimate Children 1","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> when Horace asks Reba ""Have you any children?"" she replies ""Yes. . . . I'm supporting four, in a Arkansaw home now,"" though she adds immediately ""Not mine, though"" (211).  If not, they are presumably the children of various women who have worked for her as prostitutes.</p>","No"
"21878","1847","Unnamed Husband of Popeye's Grandmother","Unnamed Husband of Popeye's Grandmother","","<p>The second husband of Popeye's maternal grandmother appears in and disappears from <em>Sanctuary</em> in half a paragraph.  We see ""an undersized, snuffy man with a mild, rich moustache"" who is very handy maintaining the boarding house his wife owns, until the day he walks out with a check to pay the butcher and instead vanishes with all the money she has saved (304).</p>","No"
"21877","1846","Unnamed Men with Gene","Unnamed Men with Gene","","<p>Like Gene, the bootlegger they work for in <em>Sanctuary</em>, the two ""young men"" who bring additional alcohol for the funeral are described as ""soiled"" (246).</p>","No"
"21876","1845","Unnamed Half-Crazed Woman","Unnamed Half-Crazed Woman","","<p>This ""old half-crazed white woman"" in <em>Sanctuary</em> is one of Jefferson's most eccentric inhabitants (200).  The physical description of her is equally striking: her ""lank grayish hair"" hangs beside ""the glittering collapse of her face"" (201).  She is reported to make her living by ""manufactur[ing] spells for negroes"" (200), though her house was also once raided by ""officers searching for whiskey"" (201).  Horace arranges for Ruby to stay in the ""lean-to shed room"" attached to her house. (This woman may recur as ""Mrs. Downs"" in <em>Intruder in the Town</em>; at the very least, the two women are essentially the same character.)</p>","Yes"
"21875","1844","Unnamed Gynecologist","Unnamed Gynecologist","","<p>Immediately before questioning Temple during Lee Goodwin's trial in <em>Sanctuary</em>, the District Attorney mentions ""the gynecologist"" who testified earlier about ""the most sacred affairs of that most sacred thing in life: womanhood"" (283-84).  The doctor himself does not appear in the novel.</p>","Yes"
"21874","1843","Unnamed Waiters at the Grotto Club","Unnamed Waiters at the Grotto Club","","<p>Waiters appear in both scenes set in the Grotto club in <em>Sanctuary</em>.  In Chapter 25, describing the funeral for Red, they are clearly identified as ""negro waiters, in black shirts beneath starched jackets.""  In the previous chapter, however, the narrative describes the two waiters who place drinks in front of Temple and Popeye in more racially ambiguous terms: seen from Temple's  perspective they appear as ""a brown [hand] in a white sleeve, a soiled white one beneath a dirty cuff"" (235).  Also in Chapter 24, ""a waiter"" shows Temple to a private room, where Red joins her (238).</p>","No"
"21873","1842","Unnamed Orchestra at the Grotto Club 2","Unnamed Orchestra at the Grotto Club 2","","<p>Musicians play at the Grotto club at two different points in <em>Sanctuary</em>.  A second ""orchestra,"" ""from a downtown hotel,"" is hired to provide music at Red's funeral.  A dispute arises about what kind of music they should play.  ""The leader"" proposes ""the Blue Danube"" by ""Strauss"" (a detail which suggests these musicians are white, 244), another man proposes ""jazz.""  But at the suggestion of the proprietor of the Grotto they first play ""Nearer My God, To Thee,"" and then the ""cornetist"" plays a solo version of ""In That Haven of Rest"" (245).  After that the music becomes more secular, as indicated by phrases like ""a brassy blare"" (246), but as the scene goes on, it is increasingly drowned out by the ""pandemonium"" created by the guests (248).</p>","No"
"21872","1841","Unnamed Orchestra at the Grotto Club 1","Unnamed Orchestra at the Grotto Club 1","","<p>Musicians play at the Grotto club at two different points in <em>Sanctuary</em>.  The first time, this regular club ""orchestra"" provides the soundtrack to the scene in which Popeye and Red compete fatally for Temple.  The dance music they play ""swirls slowly about her in a bright myriad wave"" (238).  But the narrative never describes either the musicians or the music more particularly; given the history of music in Memphis, they may be black.</p>","No"
"21871","1840","Unnamed Grotto Club Bouncer","Unnamed Grotto Club Bouncer","","<p>""A thick, muscle-bound, bullet-headed man"" wearing a badly fitting dinner jacket (243), the bouncer at the Grotto club in <em>Sanctuary</em> is put to work when he tries to remove a rowdy guest at Red's funeral and is attacked by four men.  The funeral ends when they crash into the bier and spill Red's body out of the coffin.</p>","No"
"21870","1839","Unnamed Grandmother of Popeye","Unnamed Grandmother of Popeye","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> the mother of Popeye's mother seems normal enough when first introduced, as someone who likes the strike-breaker who is Popeye's father.  After being widowed, she has remarried a man who takes good care of her boarding house - until one day he disappears with all the money she had in the bank.  Perhaps this event is what triggers her madness, a mixture of pyromania and paranoia.  Convinced that someone is trying to ""get"" her infant grandson (305), she sets a number of fires inside the house until, after leaving Popeye on the seat of a rich woman's car, she succeeds in burning it down, perishing herself in the fire.</p>","No"
"21869","1838","Unnamed Governor of Mississippi 2","Unnamed Governor of Mississippi 2","","<p>The Mississippi Governor in ""Monk"" is almost surely modeled on Governor Theodore G. Bilbo, who served two terms in that office (1916-20 and 1928-32) and as a U.S. Senator from 1934 until his death in 1947. He, like the Governor in ""Monk,"" is ""a man without ancestry"" (53), and is charged  with trading in pardons for political gain. As a critic of the Governor's ""puppet"" Pardon Board, Gavin Stevens implies that the Governor is just another crooked politician more concerned with garnering votes than dispensing any actual justice; the Governor seems comfortable admitting that is the case.  Gavin also calls him ""shrewd,"" (53), and the Governor shows himself to be just that; moreover, he's practical and realistic about Terrel's pardon, providing a stark contrast to Stevens's idealism when he concludes that ""politics in the twentieth century is a sorry thing"" (57).</p>","No"
"21868","1837","Unnamed Governor of Mississippi 3","Unnamed Governor of Mississippi 3","","<p>This is not the Governor in <em>Requiem</em> who appears onstage in Act III but a ""Governor of the State"" who was once held in the Jefferson jail for thirty days after being sentenced for contempt of court (196).  This episode is based on the real experience of former Mississippi Governor Theodore Bilbo, a native of Oxford, who in 1922 spent the same thirty days in jail.  (The Governor who does appear onstage has his own entry in the index: see Governor Henry.)</p>","Yes"
"21867","1836","Unnamed Governor of Mississippi 1","Unnamed Governor of Mississippi 1","","<p>No name is mentioned when Temple tells Ruby that the ""gu-governor comes to our house"" for dinner (56).  The real Governor of Mississippi when <em>Sanctuary</em> was published was Theodore G. Bilbo, an outspoken white supremacist - but it's not necessary to believe that Faulkner intended readers to think of specifically of him.  Temple's intention seems to be simply to assert her caste status as a shield.</p>","No"
"21866","1835","Unnamed Gas Station Mechanic","Unnamed Gas Station Mechanic","","<p>The narrator of <em>Sanctuary</em> calls the man who fills Popeye's car up in Dumfries a ""mechanic""; he indicates which way Temple went when she got out of the car (140).</p>","No"
"21865","1834","Unnamed Gas Station Clerk","Unnamed Gas Station Clerk","","<p>This clerk works inside the ""dingy confectionery"" in Dumfries where Popeye buys gas, cigarettes, candy and a sandwich in <em>Sanctuary</em> (140).</p>","No"
"21864","1833","Unnamed Filipino Woman","Unnamed Filipino Woman","","<p>Lee Goodwin has a relationship with this woman while he is stationed in the Philippines.  Ruby calls her a ""nigger"" when telling Temple about how Lee killed another American soldier in a fight over her (59), but since Ruby would be likely to use that term for any non-white person, Negro or Hispanic, it leaves open the question of the woman's racial identity.</p>","No"
"21863","1832","Unnamed Drunken Man","Unnamed Drunken Man","","<p>In the hallway of the Negro brothel that Clarence takes them to, Virgil and Fonzo see ""a drunk white man in greasy overalls"" arguing with two Negro men (198).  His overalls identify him as lower class, and tell us something about the socio-economic standing of the brothel's clientele, but no other details, about the man or the argument, are given in <em>Sanctuary</em>.</p>","No"
"21862","1831","Unnamed Detective","Unnamed Detective","","<p>All we know about this character in <em>Sanctuary</em> is that, when Horace asks the post office clerk at the University if he knows where Temple has gone, the clerk in reply asks him if he is ""another detective"" - suggesting that a detective of some kind has already been looking for Judge Temple's missing daughter (171).   We don't even know if he is a private detective, or a policeman.</p>","No"
"21861","1830","Unnamed Grocery Delivery Boy","Unnamed Grocery Delivery Boy","","<p>This boy falls while delivering groceries to Popeye's mother on his bike in <em>Sanctuary</em>.  By breaking the bottle of olive oil she ordered, he sets off a series of unfortunate incidents - but is himself unapologetic about the original mishap, telling the customer ""you ought to buy that oil in cans"" and ""you want to have that gate fixed"" (305).</p>","No"
"21860","1829","Unnamed Customers of Goodwin","Unnamed Customers of Goodwin","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Horace refers to Lee Goodwin's ""good customers,"" the men of Yoknapatawpha who regularly bought whiskey illegally from him in the past but turned on him once he was arrested (127).</p>","Yes"
"21859","1828","Unnamed Craps Dealer","Unnamed Craps Dealer","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> the Grotto employee in charge of the ""crap table"" (as the narrative calls it, though it is usually referred to as a craps table) is called ""the dealer"" when he speaks his one line in the novel: ""'Eleven,' he said"" (240).</p>","No"
"21857","1826","Unnamed Taxi Driver 3","Unnamed Taxi Driver 3","","<p>The taxi driver in ""Death Drag"" unsuccessfully tries to get Ginsfarb to tell him who jumps off the airplane in the barnstorming show.</p>","Yes"
"21856","1825","Unnamed Taxi Driver 2","Unnamed Taxi Driver 2","","<p><em>Sanctuary</em> provides the ""old"" Kinston man who drives Horace home from the train with a fairly intricate story.  ""In the old days"" he was at the head of local society, ""a planter, a landholder, son of one of the first settlers.""   But when the town ""boomed"" into sudden prosperity, he lost his property ""through greed and gullibility"" and for the last several decades has made a living as a taxi driver.  With his ""gray moustache with waxed ends"" and his ""suit of grey striped with red,"" however, he still gives off an air of gentility (297-98).</p>","No"
"21855","1824","Unnamed Congressman","Unnamed Congressman","","<p>Both times Ruby tells how the lawyer she hired got Lee out of prison in <em>Sanctuary</em>, she says he ""got  a congressman"" (59, 278).  Neither time does she go into any more details about the congressman.</p>","No"
"21854","1823","Unnamed Committee of Baptists","Unnamed Committee of Baptists","","<p>The ""committee"" of Jefferson Baptists in <em>Sanctuary</em> who protest against allowing a woman like Ruby to stay in the town's hotel in do not directly appear.  The proprietor of the hotel refers to ""these church ladies,"" but it's not clear whether they were the committee - or the group that sent the committee.  In either case, the proprietor tells Horace that ""once [them ladies] get set on a thing,"" a man ""might just as well give up and do like they say"" (180).</p>","Yes"
"21853","1822","Unnamed College Students","Unnamed College Students","","<p>The various college students mentioned in <em>Sanctuary</em> can be assorted into two groups: the ones Temple thinks about and the ones Horace sees.   (1) Temple brings her classmates to mind twice during her ordeal at the Frenchman's place: first, while lying in the dark at the Old Frenchman's place, when she thinks of ""the slow couples strolling toward the sound of the supper bell"" (51); and then, while hiding in the barn from Pap, when she imagines them ""leaving the dormitories in their new spring clothes"" toward the bells of the churches (87). She imagines these ""couples strolling toward church"" on Sunday morning again while lying in the dark at Miss Reba's (152). (2) The ""throng of them"" as seen by Horace when he gets off the train at the Oxford station (170).  ""They"" seem to be all college students, and essentially all women.  The description of what he sees does mention ""their escorts,"" the men wearing ""colored shirts"" who hold hands with them, but it is striking how those men are made almost invisible next to the women, ""in bright dresses,"" ""swinging their little hips,"" ""looking at Horace with cold, blank eyes"" (170-71).  And again, when he leaves the university branch of the post office, Horace seems to see only the female students on the campus, ""like music moving, like honey poured in sunlight"" (172).  And at the station again, waiting to leave, he watches as ""they began to gather, ""their bodies moving continually inside their scant garments"" (172).  (7 other entries in this index describe other student groups and individuals in <em>Sanctuary</em>; you can search for all of them using ""Unnamed College."")</p>","No"
"21852","1821","Unnamed College Girl","Unnamed College Girl","","<p>This is the girl in <em>Sanctuary</em> who told the Dean that Temple was ""slipping out at night,"" in retaliation for the fact that Temple went out ""with a boy she liked"" (57).</p>","No"
"21851","1820","Unnamed College Boy 3","Unnamed College Boy 3","","<p>On board the third and last train Horace takes on his way to Oxford in <em>Sanctuary</em> are two ""young men in collegiate clothes with small cryptic badges on their shirts and vests"" (168).  This one is unnamed, but together with ""Shack"" he outwits the train conductor and jokes crudely about women.</p>","No"
"21850","1819","Unnamed College Boy 2","Unnamed College Boy 2","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> this is the young man ""at school,"" whom Temple notices in Dumfries when she stops there with Popeye stops in his car.  The reader never sees him, but Temple says ""he was almost looking right at me!"" (140).</p>","No"
"21849","1818","Unnamed College Boy 1","Unnamed College Boy 1","","<p>One of Temple's many suitors and dates in <em>Sanctuary</em>, this boy is the one that she went out with sometime before the story begins, making the unnamed girl who liked him mad because, Temple says, afterwards ""he never asked her for another date"" (57).</p>","No"
"21848","1817","Unnamed College Band","Unnamed College Band","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em>, when Temple thinks of the college baseball game in Starkville that she is missing, she imagines, briefly, ""the band, the yawning glitter of the bass horn"" (37).</p>","No"
"21847","1816","Unnamed Cigar Seller 2","Unnamed Cigar Seller 2","","<p>One of the three people in <em>Sanctuary</em> who testify against Popeye at his trial for a murder he did not commit is ""a cigar-clerk"" (311).  We learn nothing about his testimony, or whether he is sincerely mistaken.</p>","No"
"21846","1815","Unnamed Chemist","Unnamed Chemist","","<p>During Lee's trial in <em>Sanctuary</em> the District Attorney mentions ""the chemist"" who has already testified, presumably about the blood stain on the corn-cob (283).</p>","Yes"
"21845","1814","Unnamed Chauffeurs","Unnamed Chauffeurs","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> six ""liveried chauffeurs"" - all presumably employed by a funeral home - drive the otherwise empty ""Packard touring cars"" that follow the hearse carrying Red's body to the cemetery (249).  The odds are good that Faulkner imagined them as Negroes, like the other drivers and chauffeurs in his fictions, but in this text their race is not specified.</p>","No"
"21844","1813","Unnamed Brother of Ruby","Unnamed Brother of Ruby","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em>, according to Ruby, her brother is just as determined as her father to keep her apart from Frank, the man she loves.  He tells his sister he's going to kill him, ""in his yellow buggy"" (58).  His ambush is foiled by her.</p>","No"
"21843","1812","Unnamed Taxi Driver 1","Unnamed Taxi Driver 1","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> this cab driver outside Miss Reba's slows down to see if Temple is looking for a ride.</p>","No"
"21842","1811","Unnamed Boys and Youths","Unnamed Boys and Youths","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> the group that visits the undertaker's parlor to get a glimpse of Tommy's body consists of boys ""with and without schoolbooks"" who press against the window and the ""bolder"" young men of the town who go inside the building, ""in twos and threes,"" for a closer look (112).</p>","Yes"
"21841","1810","Unnamed Boys and Negroes","Unnamed Boys and Negroes","","<p>This ambiguously defined group represents the ""one or two ragamuffin boys or negroes"" who ""sometimes"" visit Lee Goodwin after he's been convicted of murder and on some of those times bring him ""baskets,"" presumably containing food (115).</p>","No"
"21840","1809","Unnamed Boy with Packard","Unnamed Boy with Packard","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Temple tells Gowan that she knows ""a boy at home"" who owns a Packard automobile like the one that Popeye drives (49).</p>","No"
"21839","1808","Unnamed Bootlegger 2","Unnamed Bootlegger 2","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> the second man who rides in the truck that carries the moonshine that Lee Goodwin makes from Frenchman's Bend to Memphis literally rides ""shotgun"" - as the truck pulls away from the Frenchman's place, ""the second man lays a shotgun along the back of the seat"" (22).  He teases the driver about his impatience to get back to his woman in the city.</p>","Yes"
"21838","1807","Unnamed Bootlegger 1","Unnamed Bootlegger 1","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> the man who drives the truck carrying the moonshine that Lee Goodwin makes from Frenchman's Bend to Memphis complains about having to wait for Horace, to whom he is giving a ride to Jefferson.  ""I got a woman waiting for me,"" he says (21).</p>","Yes"
"21837","1806","Unnamed Boarding House Tenants 1","Unnamed Boarding House Tenants 1","","<p>The narrator of <em>Sanctuary</em> calls the people who board with Popeye's mother ""clients"" (304).

The couple's behavior outside the door causes Fonzo to suck in his breath, and Virgil to assume that they must be married, but while the narrator never says so explicitly, it's clear enough that she is a prostitute and he is one of her customers.  She disappears into the house.</p>","No"
"21835","1804","Unnamed Negro Bellboys","Unnamed Negro Bellboys","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em>, while listening to State Senator Clarence Snopes talk about the life he lives in the capital of Jackson, Horace conjures up images of ""bellboys"" with ""bulging jackets"" (presumably contained alcoholic beverages) making deliveries to ""hotel rooms"" (175).</p>","No"
"21834","1803","Unnamed Baseball Players","Unnamed Baseball Players","","<p>When Temple in <em>Sanctuary</em> thinks of the baseball game in Starkville that she is missing, she imagines ""the green diamond dotted with players.""  The description of their playing is unmistakably in Faulkner's words, however, not hers: ""encouraging one another with short meaningless cries, plaintive, wary and forlorn"" (37).</p>","No"
"21833","1802","Unnamed Student Barber","Unnamed Student Barber","","<p>This fellow student at the barber school with Fonzo and Virgil is presumably the person in <em>Sanctuary</em> who, twelve days after they have started sleeping at Miss Reba's, tells Fonzo about the existence in Memphis of a house of prostitution.  At any rate, he accompanies them to ""that house"" after Fonzo convinces Virgil to go (196).</p>","No"
"21832","1801","Unnamed Aunt of Temple Drake","Unnamed Aunt of Temple Drake","","<p>The aunt of Temple who lives ""up north"" in <em>Sanctuary</em> may really exist, though it is clear that when the local newspaper in Jackson publishes the news that Temple's father has sent his daughter to spend time with this woman, that is a fiction intended to cover Temple's disappearance from college (176).</p>","No"
"21831","1800","Unnamed Amorous Couple","Unnamed Amorous Couple","","<p>The ""two figures"" Horace sees locked in an embrace in ""an alley-mouth"" in Memphis in <em>Sanctuary</em> are probably outside Miss Reba's house, though it is possible they exist only in his mind, which is reeling from his encounter with Temple inside the brothel and the story she tells him about being raped.  The behavior of the couple certainly matches Horace's fascinated revulsion with sexuality: the man whispers ""unprintable epithet after epithet"" caressingly; the woman swoons with ""voluptuous ecstasy"" (221).</p>","No"
"21830","1799","Unnamed American Soldiers 2","Unnamed American Soldiers 2","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Ruby worked in New York during the First World War; according to her, the city was ""full of soldiers with money to spend"" (278).

When she lets one of them pick her up, he paws her drunkenly while telling her about Lee killing another soldier in a fight over ""that nigger woman""  (277).  American forces were first sent to the Philippines in 1898 to fight the Spanish, but soon were fighting against Philippine nationalists.

"21821","1790","Unnamed Town Boy 2","Unnamed Town Boy 2","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> only one of the three town boys - young men from Oxford instead of the university - who spend time with Gowan is named.  This entry represents the one whom the narrative refers to as ""the third"" (30).  Of the three, he seems the least affected either by all they drink or by the way Gowan boasts about his status as a ""gentleman"" (34).</p>","No"
"21820","1789","Unnamed Town Boy 1","Unnamed Town Boy 1","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> only one of the three town boys - young men from Oxford instead of the university - who spend time with Gowan is named.  This entry represents the one whom the narrative refers to as ""the first,"" because he speaks first.  He wants to know who ""that son bitch"" driving Temple away from the dance is (30).  We hear the class resentments in that voice he tells his friend Doc things like ""you're not good enough to go to a college dance"" (30).  But after Gowan offers the three a ride, he is willing to lead him to Luke's and then to the Shack, to buy and then drink whiskey.</p>","No"
"21819","1788","Unnamed Men in Grotto Club","Unnamed Men in Grotto Club","","<p>When Temple arrives at the Grotto in <em>Sanctuary</em>, she sees four men ""sitting at a table near the door"" (234).  Two soon leave, but the other two are described with a few details.  One is chewing gum with ""teeth of an unbelievable whiteness and size"" (234).  The other has ""his coat buttoned across his chest"" (235).  The two who remain forcibly carry Temple away from the club.  All four seem to be cronies of Popeye, working with him to arrange Red's murder.</p>","No"
"21818","1787","Mrs. Ed Walker","Walker, Mrs Ed","","<p>While <em>Sanctuary</em> describes the jailer's wife as ""a lank, slattern woman,"" her insistence on giving Ruby a bed after the Baptists got her thrown out of the hotel, despite her husband's reluctance to do so - ""I kin always find a bed fer a woman and child,"" she says; ""I don't keer whut Ed says"" - is welcomed by Horace (181).</p>","Yes"
"21817","1786","Ed Walker","Walker, Ed","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Ed Walker is the county jailer.  Apparently he was reluctant to allow Ruby and her child to spend a night in the jail with Lee Goodwin, but his wife, who lives with her husband in the jail and admits them, tells Horace ""I dont keer whut Ed says"" (181).</p>","Yes"
"21816","1785","Van","Van","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Van is one of the gangsters who works with Popeye to get Lee's whiskey from Yoknapatawpha to Memphis.  He is introduced into the narrative by his ""harsh, derisive laugh"" (53).   He stirs up the menace at the Old Frenchman's by fighting with both Gowan and Lee over Temple, and ripping open the raincoat she is wearing, but drives away with a shipment after that.</p>","Yes"
"21815","1783","Uncle Bud","Uncle Bud","","<p>Despite his name, in <em>Sanctuary</em> ""Uncle Bud"" is a ""small bullet-headed boy of five or six"" (250), ""with freckles like splotches of huge summer rain on a sidewalk"" (251).  He is related somehow to Miss Myrtle, though he is only staying with her temporarily, and will soon ""go back home"" (252) to ""a Arkansaw farm"" (251) - perhaps the same Arkansas orphanage where the four children whom Reba is supporting live.  He is adept at ""snitching beer"" (253); after he breaks into the icebox and drinks a whole bottle, he brings Chapter 25 to a close by throwing up.</p>","No"
"21814","1782","Tommy","Tommy","","<p>Barefoot, ""shambling,"" with ""matted and foul"" hair (10) and a ""rapt empty gaze"" (113), Tommy in <em>Sanctuary</em> helps Lee make bootleg whiskey and, when Lee is not watching, drinks it too.  He has been a familiar figure ""for fifteen years about the countryside"" (113), and occasionally in town, but no one in Yoknapatawpha knows his last name.  His behavior disconcerts both Horace and Temple.  Lee and Ruby both call him a ""feeb"" (9, 128).  He is feeble-minded but kind-hearted.  After Gowan deserts Temple, Tommy loses his life trying to protect her from Popeye.</p>","Yes"
"21813","1781","Shack","Shack","","<p>On board the third and last train Horace takes on his way to Oxford in <em>Sanctuary</em> are two ""young men in collegiate clothes with small cryptic badges on their shirts and vests"" (168).  One is unnamed, but he calls the other one ""Shack,"" presumably a nickname derived from the confectionery near the college campus (169).  ""Shack"" whistles a ""broken dance rhythm"" that the narrator calls ""meaningless, vertiginous"" (169-70).</p>","No"
"21812","1780","Red","Red","","<p>Popeye, who is himself impotent, brings Red into Temple's life as a surrogate sexual partner for her - turning Reba's ""respectable"" brothel, as she indignantly puts it in <em>Sanctuary</em>, ""into a peep-show"" (255).  Red ""looked like a college boy"" (235), but is part of the Memphis underworld.  When Temple tries to run away with Red, however, Popeye kills him.  His death is not narrated, but at the raucous funeral service that is held for him in the same speakeasy where he and Temple danced we see the hole Popeye's bullet made in ""the center of his forehead"" (249).  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> Temple calls him ""Alabama Red"" and says he worked as ""a houseman - the bouncer - at the nightclub"" that Popeye owns (114).  According to Temple in this novel, Red is ""not a criminal,"" ""just a thug"" (114), but during their unconventional sexual encounters she ""falls in love"" with him (113), and writes him the letters that in the hands of his younger brother, Pete, create the occasion for the crime that Nancy commits eight years later.</p>","No"
"21811","1779","Doctor Quinn","Doctor Quinn","","<p>""A fattish man with thin, curly hair,"" whose eyeglasses seem to be worn only ""for decorum's sake"" (149), Dr. Quinn treats Temple when she first arrives at Miss Reba's in <em>Sanctuary</em>.  Initially he refused to make a house call on Sunday, but Reba reminds him that she ""can put him in jail three times over"" (148).</p>","No"
"21810","1778","Popeye Vitelli","Popeye Vitelli","Unnamed Mother of Popeye, Unnamed Mother of Popeye","<p>The narrator of <em>Sanctuary</em> describes Popeye as someone with ""that vicious depthless quality of stamped tin"" (4).  Although Temple once calls him ""that black man"" (49), and Horace refers to ""Popeye's black presence"" (121), Popeye is white.  A modern psychologist would label him a sociopath.  Horace calls him one of ""those Memphis folks"" (21), the gangsters who buy homemade whiskey from Lee to sell in the speakeasies of the city.   He was born on Christmas, in Pensacola, Florida.  A well-known gangster in Memphis, Popeye's only connection with Yoknapatawpha seems to be bootleg liquor, and though Lee feels his presence constantly lurking outside the jail in Jefferson, Popeye may never return to Yoknapatawpha after driving away with Temple.   As a murderer, a rapist and a kidnapper who always dresses in black (which explains Temple's label), he seems perfectly cast for the role of villain - until <em>Sanctuary</em>'s last chapter describes his early life as the illegitimate child of a father whom he never sees but whose syphilis leaves him permanently damaged.  He appears again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, in descriptions of him by Temple, the woman he raped and kidnapped, and Horace, who never met him.  According to Gavin, his last name is Vitelli (114).  Temple refers to him as an ""underworld big shot"" (112).  Gavin's descriptions are more lurid: he calls Popeye  ""a psychopath . . . a little black thing with an Italian name like a neat and only slightly deformed cockroach: a hybrid, sexually incapable"" (110).  In connection with Popeye's impotence, Temple says there was no sex ""from him"" (111), and in this novel's representation of the events described in <em>Sanctuary</em> Popeye's raping her with an inanimate object is not mentioned.  In both novels, after committing two murders, Popeye is ""hanged in Alabama for a murder he did not commit"" (114).</p>","Yes"
"21809","1777","Miss Lorraine","Miss Lorraine","","<p>Miss Lorraine is one of the two women in <em>Sanctuary</em> who come back to the brothel with Miss Reba after Red's funeral.  (The context suggests they might be madams at other Memphis brothels, but that is not made explicit in the text.)  Lorraine is the ""thin woman in sober, severe clothes and gold nose-glasses"" (250).  The narrator refers to her ""flat spinster's breast"" (256) and several times compares her appearance to that of ""a school-teacher"" (251, 258).  But while ""sitting upright like a school-teacher,"" she condemns men for expecting women to ""resist temptation"" and calls Popeye a ""lousy son of a bitch"" (258, 259).</p>","No"
"21808","1776","Luke","Luke","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Luke lives and makes moonshine whiskey half a mile outside of Oxford, up a steep slope alongside ""the road to Taylor"" (32).</p>","No"
"21807","1775","Drake, Mother of Temple","Drake, Mother of Temple","","<p>During the testimony that Temple Drake of Jackson, Mississippi, gives under oath in <em>Sanctuary</em>, she says her mother is dead (285).  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, however, Gowan takes Temple's son Bucky to spend a week ""with [his] grandparents in New Orleans"" (136) -<br />
which resurrects Mrs. Drake and moves her to Louisiana.  While in the first novel Temple often thinks of her father, and she refers to him again in the second, her mother is only mentioned in these two incompatible ways.</p>","No"
"21806","1774","Unnamed Mother of Popeye","Unnamed Mother of Popeye","Unnamed Grandmother of Popeye","<p>Never named, the woman in <em>Sanctuary</em> who gave birth to Popeye is ""the daughter of a boarding house keeper"" in Pensacola (302-03).  She is already pregnant with him, and carrying the disease (probably syphilis) that will leave her an ""invalid"" (309), when she marries Popeye's father, a professional strike-breaker whom she has only known for 3 days when they decide to marry.  They were married less than 3 weeks when he takes off, leaving her to raise the child who is born with the same disease.  Under the circumstances, she seems like a very good mother, but the circumstances include thinking Popeye has perished when her pyromaniac mother burns down their house.  ""She never wholly recovered"" from that trauma (308).  She supports herself by doing ""needlework and such"" (309), and believes Popeye when, during his annual visits to see her, he says he works as a hotel clerk.</p>","No"
"21805","1773","Unnamed Father of Popeye","Unnamed Father of Popeye","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> the man who fathered Popeye is a professional strike breaker who marries Popeye's mother when she gets pregnant and then, less than three weeks later, runs off - leaving her and the child with a disease that was probably syphilis.</p>","No"
"21804","1772","Unnamed Father of Ruby","Unnamed Father of Ruby","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Ruby's father's last name may be ""Lamar.""  Popeye calls Ruby by that name once (10).  What we can say for sure about her father is that he ""runs his family"" very aggressively, cursing his son for wanting to be the one to kill Ruby's boyfriend Frank and then shooting Frank himself (58).  He calls his daughter a ""whore"" for wanting to elope (58).</p>","No"
"21803","1771","Ruby Lamar","Lamar, Ruby","","<p>Ruby Lamar is a former Memphis prostitute who appears in <em>Sanctuary</em> as the devoted common-law wife of Lee Goodwin and conscientious mother of their  very young child.  Earlier she moved to San Francisco and New York to wait for Lee while he was serving overseas, and when he is sentenced to prison for killing fellow U.S. soldier in a fight over another woman, she not only moves to Leavenworth to be near him, but hires a lawyer for him, using her body as payment.  When Lee is arrested for killing Tommy, she is prepared to pay Horace the same way.  Though jealousy is one of her motives, as the only other woman at the Old Frenchman place she tries to protect Temple from the men who desire her.  Ruby is portrayed much more sympathetically than the various women of Jefferson who condemn and ostracize her.  Her last name is not definitively ""Lamar.""  Popeye calls her ""Ruby Lamar"" once (10), but since Lamar Avenue is a major street in Memphis, where she once worked as a ""street-walker"" (117), it may be a pseudonym.  When she calls the Sheriff she identifies herself as ""Mrs Goodwin"" (105), though she and Lee almost certainly never married.  Curiously, the narrative seldom uses even her first name, but rather refers to her as ""the woman.""  One time she even identifies herself that way (164).</p>","Yes"
"21802","1770","Hershell Jones","Jones, Hershell","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Jenny tells Horace that the last ""young man"" who tried courting Narcissa was ""that Jones boy; Herschell"" (24).  From that it sounds as if Herschell belonged to a family the Benbows and Sartorises would have known socially, but beyond that we know nothing about him.</p>","Yes"
"21801","1769","Son of Lee and Ruby","Goodwin, Son of Lee and Ruby","Ruby Lamar, Lee Goodwin","<p>The narrator of <em>Sanctuary</em> tells us that Lee and Ruby's child is ""not a year old"" the first time he appears in the story - sleeping in a box behind the stove, where ""the rats cant get to him"" (18).  Ruby is carrying him or caring for him throughout the rest of the novel.  His appearance is another of the novel's unsettling elements.  When Horace looks at him lying on a bed, for example, the child is ""flushed and sweating, its curled hands above its head in the attitude of one crucified, breathing in short, whistling gasps"" (135).  At two other points Horace suggests that maybe Ruby ""holds it too much"" (117, 133).  At another he is seen by a doctor (135).  But what is specifically wrong with him, mentally or physically, remains unstated.</p>","Yes"
"21800","1768","Gene","Gene","","<p>As Gene himself says, ""I aint nothing but a bootlegger,"" but in Chapter 25 of <em>Sanctuary</em> he pays his tribute to Red by making sure there's plenty of free liquor at the funeral.  He is described as ""a far man in a shapeless greenish suit,"" with dirty hands, ""a greasy black tie"" and a very sweaty face (243-44).</p>","No"
"21799","1767","Frank","Frank","","<p>""Frank"" is mentioned in <em>Sanctuary</em> by Ruby in the bitter conversation she has with Temple.  He was a young suitor who wanted to elope with her, but when he insisted on going back to her house to tell her father about their intentions, ""father shot him"" (58).  As Ruby says, Frank ""wasn't a coward"" (58).  To Ruby's brother, who also wants to kill him, Frank is ""the goddam son of a bitch in his yellow buggy"" (58) - a detail that suggests Frank might be more prosperous than her family.</p>","No"
"21798","1766","Fonzo Winbush","Winbush, Fonzo","Winbush, Mother of Fonzo","<p>In <em>Sancutary</em> Fonzo is one of the ""two youths in new straw hats"" - both babes in the wood - who attend barber 'college' in Memphis and end up innocently renting a room in Miss Reba's bordello (177).   Fonzo is the more concupiscent of the pair in that novel:  ""always conscious of women, of female flesh,"" he leaves the door of their bedroom ajar in the hopes that one of Reba's ""daughters"" will enter (195-96), and he is the one who finds out about another brothel and takes Virgil to it.  He re-appears, briefly, in <em>The Mansion</em>, which gives him a last name, ""Winbush,"" and a family relation: in the chapter Mink Snopes narrates he says both that he ""believes"" that Fonzo is the nephew of Grover Winbush and, two pages later, that ""he was Grover Winbush's nephew"" (79, 81).</p>","Yes"
"21797","1765","Drake, Brother of Temple 3","Drake, Brother of Temple 3","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> one of Temple Drake's brothers is a ""newspaper man"" (54).  But when he finally appears in the narrative, at the end of Lee Goodwin's trial, he is indistinguishable from the other three: one of the ""younger men"" who move ""like soldiers"" when they escort Temple out of the courtroom (289).</p>","Yes"
"21796","1764","Drake, Brother of Temple 2","Drake, Brother of Temple 2","Judge Drake","<p>One of the two brothers of Temple Drake in <em>Sanctuary</em> who  ""are lawyers"" (54), and one of the four who appear at the end of Lee Goodwin's trial as the ""younger men"" who move ""like soldiers"" when they escort Temple out of the courtroom (289).</p>","Yes"

"21794","1762","Judge Drake","Drake, Judge","","<p>Temple Drake's father makes two brief appearances at the end of <em>Sanctuary</em>, but her frequent evocations of him as ""a judge"" - first smugly, but then when her world collapses as a kind of desperate prayer - occur throughout that novel.  When he arrives as a kind of belated savior in the courtroom scene, he has ""neat white hair and a clipped moustache like a bar of hammered silver against his dark skin,"" and is wearing an ""immaculate linen suit"" (288).  Temple Drake Stevens' father does not appear in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, but Temple recalls his standards of morality against which she rebelled eight years ago: Then she had ""unbounded faith that her father and brothers would know evil when they saw it, so all she had to do was, do the one thing she knew they would forbid her to do if they had the chance. And they were right about the evil, and so of course she was right too"" (108).</p>","Yes"
"21793","1761","Hubert Drake","Drake, Hubert","Judge Drake","<p>The youngest of Temple's four brothers in <em>Sanctuary</em>, Hubert is the only one given a name.  He is actually given two: Hubert and Buddy.  He told Temple ""that if he ever caught me with a drunk man, he'd beat the hell out of me"" (55).  He is a student at Yale, but is there with his brothers at the end of Lee Goodwin's trial as one of the the ""four younger men"" who move ""like soldiers"" when they escort Temple out of the courtroom (289).</p>","Yes"
"21792","1760","Doc","Doc","","<p>Of the three ""town boys"" who spend time with Gowan in <em>Sanctuary</em> (29), Doc is the only one given a name.  He is also the most vividly characterized.  He spreads broken glass across the road to show his resentment against the class system, waves a woman's panty around to establish his credentials as a man about town, makes fun of Gowan's references to ""Virginia"" to his face (33), and at first even refuses to drink with him.  Not even the whiskey dissolves his grudge.</p>","No"
"21791","1759","Unnamed Jefferson Townsmen 1","Unnamed Jefferson Townsmen 1","","<p>The ""sitting and lounging men"" on the town Square appear in ""Dry September"" twice (175).  The first time sums up the way they ""do not even follow [Minnie Cooper] with their eyes any more,"" after she passes a certain age (175).  The second time is when Minnie and her friends go to the movie while the lynching is occurring outside town, after the town has heard about the reported assault on her: ""even the young men lounging in the doorway tipped their hats and follow with their eyes the motion of her hips and legs"" (181).</p>","Yes"
"21790","1758","Unnamed Soda Fountain Clerk","Unnamed Soda Fountain Clerk","","<p>When Minnie Cooper starts drinking in ""Dry September,"" the ""youth"" who supplies her with whiskey is identified as ""a clerk at the soda fountain"" (175).

"21786","1754","Unnamed Neighbors of Minnie Cooper","Unnamed Neighbors of Minnie Cooper","","<p>In ""Dry September"" over time Minnie Cooper's only social contacts become the women who live in her neighborhood - identified as both ""neighbors"" and ""friends"" in the text (175, 180).  She occasionally goes to movie with them.  While the lynching is going on outside town, a group of them take her to another movie, walking through the streets with her, reassuring her with ""voices"" that sound ""like long, hovering sighs of hissing exultation"" that ""'there's not a Negro on the Square'"" (181).  At the end of the story, after Minnie breaks down in the theater, they take her home - and at least one of them wonders if ""anything really happened"" (182).</p>","Yes"
"21785","1753","Unnamed Man in Barber Shop","Unnamed Man in Barber Shop","","<p>This is one of the barber shop clients in ""Dry September"" who debate whether to take vigilante action against Will Mayes.

The lynching is not narrated.  Although the barber says repeatedly that ""I know Will Mayes"" (169), and believes he is innocent, the narrative refers to him mostly as ""the Negro"" and does not describe him - his age or physical experience - extensively.  Nor does story ever say what, if anything, happened between Will and Minnie.  Will himself says repeatedly but to no avail that ""I aint done nothing"" (177, 178).</p>","Yes"
"21781","1749","Henry Hawkshaw|Stribling","Hawkshaw|Stribling, Henry","","<p>Henry Hawkshaw first appears in ""Dry September.""  He is a Jefferson barber, described as ""a man of middle age; a thin, sand-colored man with a mild face"" (169).  He serves as the point of view through which the story's racial violence is presented. He tries to defend Will Mayes' character against the white men who want to lynch him, and even drives with them hoping to prevent the lynching, but in the end only 'saves' himself or at least his sensibility.  When he re-appears in ""Hair,"" his liberal sensibilities are again put into action, this time romantically.  In this short story ""Hawkshaw"" is a nickname; he legal name is Henry Stribling.  According to the narrator, the first time he saw him, Hawkshaw looked ""forty years old"" and ""a bachelor born"" (137); at the end of the story it's thirteen years later, though Gavin Stevens says Hawkshaw is still ""not much over forty-five"" (147), and he's married.  He is the son of a tenant farmer and seems quiet, church-going, and focused on his barbering.  He claims to have come from Birmingham; the narrator, on the other hand, agrees with Maxey's opinion that he ""looked like he might have come from almost anywhere in Alabama except Birmingham"" - which implies his rural origins (141). As we later discover, he's ""a hard-worker"" (138) who kept his word to pay off the mortgage on the Starneses' house. After the death of his fiancee, Sophie Starnes, he leads an itinerant life until he meets Susan Reed, a girl the rest of the town has decided is ""bad"" (147).</p>","Yes"
"21780","1748","Mrs. Cooper","Cooper, Mrs.","","<p>Minnie Cooper's mother is not explicitly named in ""Dry September,"" which mentions her once as Minnie's ""invalid mother,"" who lives with her daughter in ""a small frame house"" (173).</p>","Yes"
"21779","1747","Minnie Cooper","Cooper, Minnie","Mrs. Cooper","<p>Minnie Cooper, the central character in ""Dry September,"" is a Jefferson woman, ""thirty-eight or thirty-nine"" years of age (173); although the story is vague on this point, it is apparently her accusation of assault against Will Mayes  the precipitates the lynching. She is described as ""still on the slender side of ordinary looking, with a bright, faintly haggard manner and dress"" (174).  Never married, she lives with her mother and aunt, and has received local derision for her romantic travails and, more recently, her drinking. Toward the end of the story she suffers a nervous breakdown in a movie theater.</p>","Yes"

"21776","1744","Unnamed Owner of the Traveling Show","Unnamed Owner of the Traveling Show","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, the man who saves Jason from the furious old man who attacks him is the owner the traveling show that just played in Jefferson.  He tells Jason that he ""runs a respectable show, with a respectable troupe,"" and has already fired the man Jason is looking for (312).</p>","Yes"

"21774","1742","Unnamed Drummers 1","Unnamed Drummers 1","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Jason rages against the ""every dam drummer"" that comes to Jefferson, all of whom he imagines have sexual relations with his niece, Quentin (239).  ""Drummer"" is an archaic term for a salesman who travels from town to town.  We know that Miss Quentin is sexually active, though these specific partners are products of Jason's imagination.</p>","Yes"
"21773","1741","Unnamed Town ""Squirt""","Unnamed Town ""Squirt""","","<p>In one of his memories in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin berates Caddy for ""letting it be some darn town squirt"" who kissed her (134).  A ""town squirt"" is presumably a young man from a lower class than the Compsons - that same implication is there in Quentin's reference to ""the town squirts that Father was always teasing her about"" (174) - but it's not clear if Quentin is thinking of any one particular boy here, or remembering one particular event.</p>","Yes"
"21772","1740","Unnamed Jefferson Teachers","Unnamed Jefferson Teachers","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, according to what Quentin tells his father, these ""teachers"" break up the fight at school between him and another boy (67).</p>","Yes"

"21770","1738","Unnamed Showman's Sister","Unnamed Showman's Sister","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, as part of his fictional alibi, Jason invents this ""sister"" of the fictional ""showman"" who borrows his car; her equally invented husband is supposedly involved with ""some town woman"" (258).</p>","Yes"
"21769","1737","Unnamed Showman's Brother-in-Law","Unnamed Showman's Brother-in-Law","","<p>As part of his fiction about loaning his car to a showman in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, Jason invents an adulterous ""brother-in-law"" involved with ""some town woman"" (258).</p>","Yes"
"21768","1736","Unnamed Showman","Unnamed Showman","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> to refute his niece's accusation that he has been following her, Jason invents a story about the ""showman"" who borrows his car to chase after his ""sister's husband"" (258).</p>","Yes"
"21767","1735","Unnamed Band Members 1","Unnamed Band Members 1","","<p>Readers of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> never see the band that plays in the traveling show visiting Jefferson, but several of the novel's black characters talk about it, and in Jason's section both he and Uncle Job hear the music they are making.  ""That's a good band,"" Job says (248); ""Dem folks sho do play dem horns"" (230).  Jason refers to the show's performers as ""a bunch of Yankees"" (230), but there's no clear evidence that they come from the North.</p>","Yes"
"21766","1734","Unnamed Show Cook","Unnamed Show Cook","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the old ""man in a dirty apron"" Jason spots at the train carrying the traveling show in Mottson is probably a cook.  Though smaller than Jason, he becomes a ""puny fury"" when he feels Jason has insulted him, driving to get to his ""butcher knife"" and then attacking Jason with a ""rusty hatchet"" (309-10).  As the owner of the show later tells Jason, warning him to stay away from the show, ""That damn little wasp'll kill you"" (312).</p>","Yes"
"21765","1733","Unnamed Negro Bootblacks in Boston","Unnamed Negro Bootblacks in Boston","","<p>After leaving Parker's in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, Quentin notes that ""two bootblacks caught me, one on either side, shrill and raucous, like blackbirds.

Though the text does not make their race explicit, the ""blackbird"" image suggests that these two individuals are African American.</p>","No"
"21764","1732","Unnamed Sexual Partners of Miss Quentin","Unnamed Sexual Partners of Miss Quentin","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Miss Quentin, like her mother Caddy, is sexually active as a teenager (and also seems to be pregnant, as Caddy was with her, out of wedlock).  Jason is sure that his niece makes herself available not only to all the ""slick-headed jellybeans"" (184) and ""dam squirts"" (188) in Jefferson but to ""every dam drummer and cheap show [man] that comes to town"" (239).  Jason's opinions about women reveal at least as much about him as about them, but Luster does confirm that Caddy's daughter is very promiscuous when he tells the man with the red tie that he ""dont keep no track"" of all the men who come ""every night she can climb down that tree"" (50).</p>","Yes"
"21763","1731","Unnamed Self-Mutilator","Unnamed Self-Mutilator","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> this ""man who mutilated himself"" by cutting off his genitals with a ""broken razor"" is known to readers only through Quentin's recollection of a story Versh tells him (116).</p>","No"
"21762","1730","Unnamed Roman Soldiers","Unnamed Roman Soldiers","","<p>In his sermon in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Rev. Shegog refers to the Romans who hunt for the newborn Jesus as both the ""po-lice"" and as ""sojers"" (296).</p>","No"

"21760","1728","Unnamed Pregnant Slave","Unnamed Pregnant Slave","","<p>In the story that Versh tells in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> about the ""old time,"" this is the slave he calls ""family woman"" - i.e. she is pregnant; when she looks the ""bluegum"" man ""in the eye in the full of the moon,"" all the ""chillen"" she gives birth to are ""born bluegum"" (69).</p>","Yes"
"21759","1727","Unnamed Post Office Employee","Unnamed Post Office Employee","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the unnamed post office clerk whom Quentin asks about Anse's whereabouts is wearing a ""frock coat"" and ""reading a newspaper"" (130). He suggests Quentin take the girl ""past them houses by the river"" (130).</p>","No"
"21758","1726","Unnamed Possum Hunters","Unnamed Possum Hunters","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the ""possum hunters"" who find the bones of the ""bluegum"" man who had been eaten by ""them bluegum chillen"" are not explicitly identified as black in the story Versh tells Benjy (69), but given the African American folk context of the tale and the stereotypical association of possums and blacks, that seems likely.  When Quentin hunts possum in his section of the novel, it is with Versh Gibson and Louis Hatcher, both black.</p>","Yes"
"21757","1725","Unnamed People of Massachusetts Town","Unnamed People of Massachusetts Town","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> when Quentin is taken by Anse across the river and the railroad tracks and up ""the main street"" of the town outside of Cambridge where he has been wandering, the ""procession"" also includes two men, Julio and his sister, and the boys who had been swimming (141).  This motley parade attracts the attention of the local  residents.  ""People"" come their doors ""to look at us,"" and ""more boys"" join the procession (141).  All the novel allows us to say for sure about these townspeople is that they are obviously curious.</p>","No"
"21756","1724","Unnamed People of Cambridge","Unnamed People of Cambridge","","<p>These are the people in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> who pass along the streets in Cambridge outside the window of Quentin's streetcar - he sees, for example, ""the crowns of people's heads passing beneath new straw hats not yet unbleached"" (89).</p>","No"
"21755","1723","Unnamed People at Mr. Compson's Funeral","Unnamed People at Mr. Compson's Funeral","","<p>When Jason remembers his father's funeral in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, he mentions the people who ""were holding umbrellas"" (201) and who filled in the grave, ""throwing dirt into it"" (202).  Presumably some of these people are from the community, and presumably some are paid cemetery workers, but ""they"" are not described in any detail.</p>","Yes"
"21754","1722","Unnamed Parade Marchers","Unnamed Parade Marchers","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin and Deacon discuss the time the black man marched in the parade ""on Decoration Day"" (82).  Decoration Day was the southern name for Memorial Day, originally created to honor the veterans of the Civil War and in 1910 it would have been celebrated on the last Monday of May.  Deacon mentions both ""the old vet'runs"" and the ""ladies"" who organize the celebration (98).  Deacon was was wearing a ""G.A.R. uniform,"" i.e. the uniform of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Union army (82).  Several hundred thousand African Americans did wear that uniform and serve in the Civil War, though it seems unlikely that Deacon himself was one of them.  (The title of ""Deacon"" is itself another example of the way he invents his life story.)</p>","No"
"21753","1721","Unnamed Negroes in Memphis Brothel","Unnamed Negroes in Memphis Brothel","","<p>While reflecting on 'Negroes' and how ""they"" behave in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, Quentin remembers hearing or reading about the ""brothel full of them in Memphis"" who ran naked into the street during ""a religious trance"" (170).</p>","No"

"21751","1719","Unnamed Negro Preacher 1","Unnamed Negro Preacher 1","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> this man is the regular preacher at the Negro church in Jefferson. Though he does not give the Easter sermon, he enters the church with Reverend Shegog and is described in sharp contrast to the ""undersized"" visiting clergyman: he is ""huge, of a light coffee color, imposing in a frock coat. His head is magisterial and profound, his neck rolled above his collar in rich folds"" (293).</p>","Yes"
"21750","1718","Unnamed Negro in Virginia","Unnamed Negro in Virginia","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin sees this man in Virginia, from the window of the train carrying him back to Yoknapatawpha from Harvard for the holidays.  He is sitting patiently on a mule without a saddle, ""waiting for the train to move"" (86).  When Quentin calls out ""Christmas gift!"" to him, he replies, ""Sho comin, boss. You done caught me, aint you"" (87).  To Quentin, he seems ""like a sign put there saying You are home again"" in the South (87).</p>","No"
"21749","1717","Unnamed Negro Church Procession","Unnamed Negro Church Procession","","<p>The procession at the Negro church in Jefferson in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> consists of ""six small children: four girls with tight pigtails bound with small scraps of cloth like butterflies, and two boys with close napped heads"" (292). At the start of the service on Easter Sunday, the children ""entered and marched up the aisle, strung together in a harness of white ribbons and flowers"" (292).  Later they sing with the choir ""in thin, frightened, tuneless whispers"" (293).</p>","Yes"

"21747","1715","Unnamed Negro at the Forks","Unnamed Negro at the Forks","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Jason questions this man he encounters at ""the forks"" where two roads diverge about which way the Ford carrying Quentin and the man in the red tie went (238).</p>","Yes"
"21746","1714","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 2","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 2","","<p>Many different people from Yoknapatawpha appear in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>. This is a group that exists only in Jason Compson's head, the ""you"" he is arguing with as he sits alone in his car while chasing his niece through the county: he compares his family to this hypothetical ""you,"" as in ""you all were running little shirt tail country stores"" and farming poor soil while his ""people"" owned slaves (239).</p>","Yes"
"21744","1713","Unnamed Slaves at Compsons'","Unnamed Slaves at Compsons'","","<p>While chasing his niece across the Yoknapatawpha countryside Jason thinks about the ""slaves"" that ""my people"" used to own; in his mind slave-owning is a source of pride, a symbol of the Compsons' high social standing (239). The novel says almost nothing about these people, but when Versh - one of the Compsons' servants and, as Dilsey's son, descended from the men and women who had been enslaved forty years earlier - tells Benjy a story about changing names, he mentions one male Compson slave who ""turned preacher"" after his name was changed, the ""family woman"" who looked at this man, and the ""chillen"" who were born into slavery (69).  The entire passage is difficult to understand, but the reference to ""family woman"" is especially vague.  It may just mean a pregnant woman (or perhaps more than one) who has a number of children, or it may imply that a specific enslaved woman (or again, perhaps more than one) was specifically used to breed more slaves.  Unnamed Compson Slave and Unnamed Bluegum Children have separate entries in this index.</p>","Yes"
"21742","1712","Unnamed Musical Saw Player","Unnamed Musical Saw Player","","<p>While never seen nor (unlike the band the traveling show brings to Jefferson) even heard, the performer who ""can play a tune on a saw"" (15) is mentioned or (when Luster spends so much of Easter trying to imitate him) alluded to in all four sections of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>.   He is perhaps the novel's figure of the artist.</p>","Yes"
"21741","1711","Unnamed Mottson Pedestrians","Unnamed Mottson Pedestrians","","<p>While Jason waits in his car outside the locked Mottson drug store in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, he watches passerbys and reflects on their perspectives about him: ""Some looked at him as they passed, at the man sitting quietly behind the wheel of a small car, with his invisible life raveled out about him like a wornout sock, and went on"" (313).</p>","Yes"
"21740","1710","Unnamed Men at Mottson Gas Station","Unnamed Men at Mottson Gas Station","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, at ""a filling station"" in Mottson, ""they"" tell Jason where the traveling show can be found (308).

"21739","1709","Unnamed Negroes in Mottson","Unnamed Negroes in Mottson","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> these ""two negro lads"" tell Jason they can drive a car, but are not willing to take him to Jefferson for two dollars (312).</p>","Yes"
"21737","1708","Unnamed Missionary to China","Unnamed Missionary to China","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Jason mentions this ""Chinese missionary"" whom the rich Jefferson merchant ""bought"" for ""five thousand dollars a year,"" in order to ease his conscience (194).  The reference is ambiguous enough to possibly mean the missionary himself is 'Chinese' or perhaps Chinese-American, but it is far more likely that he is a white American on a religious mission to China.</p>","No"
"21736","1707","Unnamed Men Who Assist Anse","Unnamed Men Who Assist Anse","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> these two men help break up Julio's attack on Quentin, and then keep an eye on Julio during the walk to the Squire who will decide Quentin's case.   They may be the marshal's assistants, or simply two bystanders who are pulled into the story by Julio's attack on and accusation against Quentin.</p>","No"
"21735","1706","Unnamed Men in Front of Store","Unnamed Men in Front of Store","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> these two men sitting in front of a store talk to Quentin during his attempt to find the home of the little girl he met in the bakery.</p>","No"
"21734","1705","Unnamed Men at Boathouse","Unnamed Men at Boathouse","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> these two men carry the rowing ""shell"" that Gerald Bland uses from the boat house to the water (90).</p>","No"
"21733","1704","Unnamed Maid in Memphis","Unnamed Maid in Memphis","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> this woman is mentioned by Jason when he remembers the last time he saw Lorraine in Memphis.  He gives ""the maid"" five dollars (194).  It is likely that Lorraine herself is a prostitute, and that the maid works for the brothel, not Lorraine personally.  And while Jason does not specifically say the maid is black, based on the other maids in and out of brothels in Faulkner's world it is safe to assume she is.</p>","No"
"21732","1703","Unnamed Interurban Train Passengers","Unnamed Interurban Train Passengers","","<p>On the interurban that carries him back to Cambridge in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, Quentin self-consciously notices how the other passengers in the car are all ""looking at my [black] eye"" (170).  One passenger is individualized: looking at his reflection in the window of the car, Quentin sees superimposed on his own face the reflection of this woman sitting across the aisle from him, wearing a hat ""with a broken feather in it"" (169).</p>","No"
"21731","1702","Unnamed Trolley Passengers","Unnamed Trolley Passengers","","<p>When Quentin boards the first of the Boston streetcars he rides during the day in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, he notes that it full of ""mostly prosperous looking people reading newspapers"" (86).  Specific passengers in the car include a Negro who is wearing ""a derby and shined shoes"" and holding ""a dead cigar stub"" - having to sit next to him prompts Quentin to reflect on the relationship between blacks and whites (86).  Other passengers are ""women with market baskets"" and a man in ""a stained hat with a pipe stuck in the band"" (89).  As the trolley moves through the city, Quentin notices that ""men in work-clothes"" are ""beginning to outnumber the shined shoes and collars"" (89).</p>","No"
"21730","1701","Unnamed Carnival Worker","Unnamed Carnival Worker","","<p>The man with whom Caddy's daughter Quentin runs away from home works for the ""show"" that performs in Jefferson over the Easter weekend. In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, he is identified in both Benjy's and Jason's sections by his ""red tie"" (49, 232).  He is only mentioned in the ""Appendix"" that Faulkner wrote in 1945, as a  ""pitchman in a travelling streetshow"" (330), but this text adds a detail to his biography: when he left with Miss Quentin, he ""was already under sentence for bigamy"" (342).</p>","Yes"
"21729","1700","Unnamed Man in Mottson","Unnamed Man in Mottson","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, when this man ""comes along"" the sidewalk outside the closed Mottson drugstore, Jason asks him if there's a ""drugstore open anywhere"" and when ""the northbound train"" runs (312).</p>","No"
"21728","1699","Unnamed Man at Compson House","Unnamed Man at Compson House","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Benjy remembers seeing ""a head come out"" of the room where ""Father was sick"" (34).  ""It wasn't Father,"" he knows - though he doesn't know his father has just died - but someone Benjy has not seen before.  He seems to be taking charge when he tells T.P. to take Benjy ""out of the house,"" which suggests he might be a doctor (34).</p>","Yes"
"21727","1698","Unnamed Girl in Bland's Story","Unnamed Girl in Bland's Story","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Shreve's account of Quentin's fight with Bland includes the ""wench that he made a date with to meet at a dance hall in Atlantic city"" (166); Bland boasts about standing her up, so she doesn't appear even in his story, and Shreve's account seems skeptical about Bland's whole story - but in his own mind Quentin's attack on Bland seems to be an attempt to defend this young woman's honor</p>","No"
"21725","1697","Unnamed Man at Pump","Unnamed Man at Pump","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin notices this man ""filling a pail"" with water from the pump where Shreve is helping him wash his face (165).</p>","No"
"21724","1696","Unnamed Man in Livery Stable","Unnamed Man in Livery Stable","","<p>This man in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> tells Quentin that the marshal is not there, and that he doesn't recognize the little girl with Quentin: ""Them furriners.

"21723","1695","Unnamed Jeweler 1","Unnamed Jeweler 1","","<p>The jeweler in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> to whom Quentin shows his broken watch appears only briefly, but is described in a few vivid details.  He is ""going bald,"" his hair is ""parted in the center,"" and ""the part runs up into the bald spot, like a drained marsh in December"" (83, 85).  He wears a jeweler's loupe that ""left a red circle around his eye"" (84).  He seems familiar with the customs of Harvard students; Quentin's behavior makes him think he has been drinking, perhaps to celebrate the crew meet in New London.</p>","No"
"21721","1693","Unnamed Negro Servant of Bland","Unnamed Negro Servant of Bland","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> this man seems more a product of Mrs. Bland's imagination than a real person.  One of the stories she tells about her son Gerald focuses on the loyalty of ""his nigger,"" who pleads to be allowed to accompany his ""marster"" to Harvard (107).</p>","Yes"
"21720","1692","Unnamed Boy 1","Unnamed Boy 1","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, after the Patterson boy stops selling kites with him, Jason finds a new partner, presumably another child about his own age (and presumably more lackadaisical than the Patterson boy about who ends up with the money they make).</p>","Yes"
"21718","1691","Unnamed Jealous Husband","Unnamed Jealous Husband","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin recalls a story that Mrs. Bland tells about Gerald, involving ""a sawmill husband"" - the lower-class husband of a woman with whom Gerald has had sexual relations - who confronts him with a shotgun (107).  According to Quentin's remembered version, Gerald is supposed to have bitten the gun in two.   It's not clear how much of the exaggeration here is Mrs. Bland's and how much Quentin's.</p>","No"
"21717","1690","Unnamed Italian-American Girl","Unnamed Italian-American Girl","","<p>The unnamed ""secretive"" little girl (126) who somehow becomes attached to Quentin in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> is the child of Italian immigrants, though it is possible that she herself - unlike her older brother Julio - was born in the U.S.  Quentin describes her complexion as ""like a cup of milk dashed with coffee,"" implying she is not exactly 'white' (125).  She apparently can speak English, but when she meets Quentin at the bakery, she does not tell him who she is or where she lives, and she remains mysteriously silent while he travels with her in search of her home.  The way she looks at him - ""her eyes black and unwinking and friendly"" (131) - make him increasingly anxious.</p>","No"
"21716","1689","Unnamed Immigrant Woman","Unnamed Immigrant Woman","","<p>This unnamed Italian immigrant in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> does not speak English.  When Quentin knocks at her door hoping to find the home of the little girl who has been accompanying him since he left the bakery, the woman seems to understand his question, but her answer is undecipherable: ""'Si, si,' she said, holding back, showing me whatever it was"" (132).</p>","No"
"21715","1688","Unnamed Squad of Soldiers","Unnamed Squad of Soldiers","","<p>In one of the fantasies he has while driving to Mottson Jason in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> imagines leading ""a file of soldiers"" to capture the sheriff who would not help him (306).  While Jason's grandfather was a General in the Confederate Army, he himself never led troops, or served in any army.</p>","No"
"21714","1687","Unnamed Mule Team Owner","Unnamed Mule Team Owner","","<p>While chasing his niece and his money in the last section of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, Jason imagines a scene in which he commandeers someone's team of mules to pull his car from the imagined mud that is trying to stop his pursuit.  The team's ""owner"" whom he strikes down is, of course, like the whole episode, his own invention (306).</p>","No"
"21713","1686","Unnamed Harvard Students","Unnamed Harvard Students","","<p>In addition to the ones who are named (Shreve, Bland, Spoade), a number of unnamed Harvard students appear at different points in Quentin's section of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>.  He thinks about the crew team - ""them down at New London"" getting ready to race Yale - almost as soon as he wakes up (77).  Looking out his dorm room window, he watches the undergraduates ""running for chapel"": ""the same ones fighting the same heaving coat-sleeves, the same books and flapping collars"" (78).  Shreve teases him about what the ""Square students"" - students hanging around Harvard Square - will say when they see Quentin in his ""new suit"" (82).  They appear in other passages as well, though readers never see any of them studying or inside a classroom.</p>","No"
"21712","1685","Unnamed Harvard Proctor","Unnamed Harvard Proctor","","<p>Harvard's ""proctor"" appears in Quentin's section of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> when he remembers the way Mrs. Bland tried to have Shreve moved out of the suite he and Quentin share - because he didn't strike her as a suitable roommate for a Mississippi Compson.  ""The proctor reveals enough low stubbornness to insist on consulting Shreve first,"" and the change is never made (106).    (This is an unusual use of 'proctor' - who is usually someone monitoring students taking an exam; perhaps Faulkner meant 'dean' or 'registrar.')</p>","No"
"21711","1684","Unnamed Harvard Freshmen","Unnamed Harvard Freshmen","","<p>Deacon appears in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> walking ""along between a couple of freshmen"" (97).  They disappear after Quentin asks to speak with him, but not before Deacon tells the pair that he was glad to have chatted with them.</p>","No"
"21710","1683","Unnamed Harvard Crew Team","Unnamed Harvard Crew Team","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the annual Harvard-Yale crew race is scheduled to take place a few days after June 2, 1910.  Perhaps because Quentin is about use a river to drown himself, he thinks about the race, and the team - ""them down at New London"" - several times in his section of the novel (77, 105, etc.).</p>","No"
"21709","1682","Unnamed Hardware Store Customers","Unnamed Hardware Store Customers","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the customers come to Earl's hardware store on Friday are mostly country folks who are in town for the visiting show.  Jason describes his job waiting on them bitterly as running ""to sell some redneck a dime's worth of nails or something"" (211).</p>","Yes"
"21708","1681","Unnamed Hardware Store Customer","Unnamed Hardware Store Customer","","<p>Jason describes the customer to whom he sells a ""twenty-cent hame string"" in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> as a ""dam redneck"" (194-95).</p>","Yes"
"21707","1680","Unnamed Hardware Store Clerk","Unnamed Hardware Store Clerk","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> this ""clerk"" in the hardware store in Boston sells Quentin two six-pound flat-irons (85).</p>","Yes"
"21706","1679","Unnamed Grandfather of Gerald Bland","Unnamed Grandfather of Gerald Bland","","<p>The man Mrs. Bland refers to as ""Gerald's grandfather"" in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> is almost certainly her father, so we don't know his last name (148).  In her account, he is a very traditional southern aristocrat, and very fussy about the ingredients in his mint julep.</p>","No"
"21704","1677","Unnamed Golfer","Unnamed Golfer","","<p>This particular golfer in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> is the one to whom Luster tries to sell the golf ball he claims to have ""found"" in the yard.  When Luster gives him the ball to look at, the ""white man"" puts it in his own pocket and tells Luster to ""find yourself another one"" (53).</p>","Yes"
"21703","1676","Unnamed Negro Gas Station Attendant","Unnamed Negro Gas Station Attendant","","<p>At the gas station where Jason stops after leaving the Sheriff's house in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, this Negro employee fills Jason's tank with gas and his tires with air.</p>","Yes"
"21702","1675","Unnamed Financial Advisors","Unnamed Financial Advisors","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Jason refers to the people whom he pays to advise him on his cotton speculations in several different ways: ""some people who're right there on the ground"" in New York (192), ""those rich New York jews"" (193), and so on.  Included in this group, according to him, is ""one of the biggest manipulators in New York"" (192).  The labels he uses say much more about his own antisemitism than they do about Wall Street analysts.</p>","No"
"21701","1674","Unnamed Female Classmate","Unnamed Female Classmate","","<p>This is the ""she"" in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> whose innocence or honor Quentin tries to protect by fighting the male classmate who is threatening to ""put a frog in her desk"" (68).  She is probably another student, but may be the teacher - in any case, Mr. Compson, who knows his son Quentin, says ""Oh. . . . She"" when Quentin tells him about the fight (68).</p>","Yes"
"21700","1673","Unnamed Dentist","Unnamed Dentist","","<p>While there would probably be a dentist in Jefferson, ""the dentist"" in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> whom Jason tells Earl he had to see over the lunch break is Jason's invention (227).  And it may be worth noting that, although there are over a dozen doctors in the fictions, the only dentist is this imaginary one.</p>","No"
"21699","1672","Unnamed Crucified Thief","Unnamed Crucified Thief","","<p>In his Easter sermon in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Rev. Shegog mentions the two men who were crucified on either side of Jesus.  He refers to ""de thief and de murderer"" (296).  The ""thief"" is presumably the man mentioned in the Gospels who rebukes the other criminal for mocking Jesus and asks Jesus to remember him when he reaches heaven.</p>","No"
"21698","1671","Unnamed Crucified Murderer","Unnamed Crucified Murderer","","<p>In the Easter sermon Rev. Shegog preaches in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> he refers to the two men who were crucified alongside Jesus as ""de thief and de murderer"" (296).  By the ""murderer"" he presumably means the thief who killed the men he robbed.  In the Gospels this man taunts Jesus even as they are crucified, which may explain Shegog's ""I hears de boastin en de braggin"" (296).</p>","No"
"21697","1670","Unnamed Crew of Schooner","Unnamed Crew of Schooner","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> these two men operate the schooner Quentin watches going under the drawbridge over the Charles: one is ""naked to the waist .  .  . coiling down a line on the fo'c's'le head"" and the other is ""in a straw hat without any crown . . . at the wheel"" (89).</p>","No"
"21696","1669","Unnamed Clock Repairer","Unnamed Clock Repairer","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Jason mentions that because of the pigeons roosting in the courthouse clock, the town ""had to pay a man forty-five dollars to clean it"" (247).</p>","Yes"
"21695","1668","Unnamed Boy with Frog","Unnamed Boy with Frog","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin gets in a fight with this boy when he threatened to put a frog in a girl's desk - or possibly the teacher's desk; she is female too.  Quentin tells Mr. Compson, though, that ""He was as big as me"" (67).</p>","Yes"
"21694","1667","Unnamed Cigar Seller 1","Unnamed Cigar Seller 1","","<p>Referred to simply as ""the girl"" (83), this employee at Parker's Restaurant in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> recommends the fifty-cent cigar to Quentin as the best - he buys one, lights it, and then quickly gives it away.</p>","No"
"21693","1666","Unnamed Boy 3","Unnamed Boy 3","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin thinks of the three boys carrying fishing poles whom he meets at the bridge as ""the first,"" ""the second"" and ""the third"" (117 etc.), but they can also be distinguished from each other by their actions (and the fact that one is called ""Kenny"" by another, 122).  This is the ""third"" boy, who seems the most agreeable and least interesting of the three, although like his friends, he is upset when Quentin comes along later with the unnamed little girl and watches them swimming - because they are swimming naked.</p>","No"
"21692","1665","Unnamed Boy 2","Unnamed Boy 2","","<p>One of the three boys carrying fishing poles whom Quentin encounters in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> is named ""Kenny"" (122).  This is one of the two who are not; Quentin thinks of them as ""the first,"" ""the second"" and ""the third"" (117 etc.) and they can be distinguished from each other.  This ""second"" boy, for example, imagines catching the trout and exchanging it for a ""horse and wagon"" (117) - Quentin refers to him as ""the one that thought the horse and wagon back there at the bridge"" (137), and he is consistently the most contrary of the three.</p>","No"
"21691","1664","Unnamed Boston Folks","Unnamed Boston Folks","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the bridge over the Charles where Quentin decides to commit suicide is also a place, he learns from the boys he meets there, where ""Boston folks"" come to fish for the renowned trout who swims under it (119).</p>","No"
"21690","1663","Unnamed Bluegum Children","Unnamed Bluegum Children","","<p>According to dictionaries of American and African American slang, a 'bluegum' is a black person whose lips and/or gums look blue.  The word appears in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> in the folklore story Versh tells Benjamin about the Compsons before the Civil War.  After one of their slaves becomes a ""bluegum,"" the pregnant women he looks at deliver children who are ""bluegum chillen,"" and after ""about a dozen"" of these children are born, they eat him (69).</p>","Yes"
"21689","1662","Unnamed Bakery Employee","Unnamed Bakery Employee","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> this woman waits on Quentin in the bakery shop.   According to Quentin, she looks ""like a librarian"" (125).  She is very hostile to ""them foreigners"" in her neighborhood, and suspects that the little girl in her store may be shoplifting: ""She'll hide it under her dress and a body'd never know it"" (126).</p>","No"
"21688","1661","Unnamed Caddies","Unnamed Caddies","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the golfers who play on the course that has been built on what used to be the Compsons' pasture are accompanied by caddies who carry their clubs, look for mishit balls, and so on.  Perhaps ahistorically, in their speech and treatment of the black characters like Luster these caddies are depicted as white rather than black.</p>","No"
"21687","1660","Unnamed Caddie","Unnamed Caddie","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the invisible ""caddie"" who is called by the golfers while Luster looks for the quarter never specifically appears.  In a sense he exists in Benjy's section in name only, whenever the golfers on the course beside the Compson yard call ""caddie"" (3).  The fact that whenever this name is called Benjy instead hears ""Caddy"" makes this and the book's other ""caddies"" major characters in his mind.</p>","Yes"
"21686","1659","Doc Wright","Wright, Doc","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Doc Wright trades on the commodities market at the telegraph office, where he can keep tabs on the price of cotton. He and Jason discuss trading strategy.  (In other texts there are characters nicknamed 'Doc' who are not medical doctors, but whether Wright is or isn't a 'real' doctor is not made clear.)</p>","Yes"
"21685","1658","Parson Walthall","Walthall, Parson","","<p>The minister of the Methodist Church in Jefferson in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> is named Parson Walthall; he protests the slaughter of the town's pigeons to prevent them from fouling the town clock.</p>","No"
"21684","1657","Squire","Squire","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the local justice of the peace or magistrate who hears the complaint against Quentin involving Julio's sister is referred to only as ""Squire"" (139). His courtroom is ""a bare room smelling of stale tobacco"" and ""a scarred littered table,"" the book in which he enters Quentin's name is a ""huge dusty"" one, and he himself has ""a fierce roach of iron gray hair"" and wears ""steel spectacles"" (142).  He fines Quentin but releases him without a formal charge.</p>","No"
"21683","1656","Spoade I","Spoade I","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Spoade is the last name of a senior at Harvard College with Quentin in 1910.  He jokingly calls Shreve Quentin's ""husband"" (78).   Quentin says Spoade has ""five names, including that of a present English ducal house"" (91-92), but he never thinks of him except as ""Spoade""  - his first name is never given. He is from South Carolina, and lives up to the image of a southern aristocrat in a number of ways besides his name, including the fact that he goes to chapel every day in dishabille.  Quentin can tell it's nearly noon when he sees that Spoade has put his shirt on (95).  He is mentioned in <em>The Mansion</em> as having ""been at Harvard back in 1909"" with Gavin Stevens rather than Quentin Compson - a strange Faulknerian coincidence that is not remarked on in the text (229).</p>","No"
"21682","1655","Simmons","Simmons","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Mr. Simmons (whom Jason calls ""old man Simmons,"" 216) possesses the key to the old opera house that Jason borrows.</p>","Yes"
"21681","1654","Reverend Shegog","Shegog, Reverend","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Shegog is the visiting clergyman from St. Louis who gives the Easter sermon at the Negro church in Jefferson.  Physically he is unimpressive: ""The visitor was undersized, in a shabby alpaca coat. He had a wizened black face like a small, aged monkey"" (293).  But he possesses a powerful voice: the congregation soon forgets ""his insignificant appearance in the virtuosity"" of his voice (293).  And when his ""intonation"" and ""pronunciation"" become ""negroid"" (295) as he preaches about the resurrection of Christ, ""the congregation seemed to watch with its own eyes while the voice consumed him, until he was nothing and they were nothing and there was not even a voice but instead their hearts were speaking to one another in chanting measures beyond the need for words . . ."" (294).</p>","Yes"
"21680","1653","Ab Russell","Russell, Ab","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Ab Russell is a Yoknapatawpha farmer, one of the few, Jason notes, who has plowed his cotton field by April 6, 1928.  Jason walks across his field chasing his niece and the man in the red tie; after they let the air out of Jason's tire, Russell lends him a pump.</p>","Yes"
"21679","1652","Mrs. Patterson","Patterson, Mrs.","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the Pattersons live next door to the Compsons.  Maury Bascomb has an affair with Mrs. Patterson when the Compson children are young.  At least once Caddy takes her a letter from ""Uncle Maury,"" and sometime later Benjy tries to deliver another.  On that occasion we hear Mrs. Patterson call Benjy ""you idiot"" as she tries to grab the letter before her husband can reach him (13).</p>","Yes"
"21678","1651","Mr. Patterson","Patterson, Mr.","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the Pattersons live next door to the Compsons.  Mr. Patterson beats up Maury Bascomb when he learns that his wife is having an affair with him.</p>","Yes"
"21677","1650","Patterson Boy","Patterson Boy","Mrs. Patterson, Mr. Patterson","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> the Pattersons' house is adjacent to the Compsons'.  Quentin remembers that when Jason was younger, he and ""the Patterson boy . . . made kites on the back porch and sold them for a nickel a piece"" (94).  Jason parted ways with him, apparently when the boy complained about not getting his share of the profits.</p>","Yes"
"21676","1649","New York Yankees","New York Yankees","","<p>In Faulkner's fictions ""Yankees"" typically refers to the Union soldiers during the Civil War or people from the North in general; in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, however, it refers to the New York Yankees baseball team.  The 1927 Yankees, which featured Babe Ruth as part of a lineup called 'Murderers' Row,' is often cited as the greatest team in baseball history.   Despite this, in his April 1928 conversation with Mac, Jason Compson insists ""They're shot"" (252), adding that he'd never bet on them.  Jason presumably has a prejudice against any kind of 'Yankee,' but specifically expresses his contempt for Ruth.  In 1928, Ruth hit 54 homers and the Yankees again won the pennant.</p>","No"
"21675","1648","Natalie","Natalie","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Natalie is a girl about Quentin and Caddy's age who lives near their house.  Caddy calls her ""a dirty girl"" (134) after catching her and Quentin naively exploring their sexualities together in the barn, but their behavior would probably seem natural enough to anyone but Quentin.  Natalie does, however, take the lead in this exploration, and given the contemptuous way Caddy treats her (calling her ""Cowface,"" for example, 136), the novel might be suggesting she is lower class.</p>","Yes"
"21674","1647","Miss Laura","Laura, Miss","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Miss Laura is Quentin's elementary school teacher.  She disconcerts Quentin when she asks him ""who discovered the Mississippi River"" (88), but she may also be the teacher Quentin refers to in Benjy's section, when he tells his father about trying to protect her from a boy who ""said he would put a frog in her desk"" (68).</p>","Yes"
"21673","1646","Mink","Mink","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Mink works at the livery stable in Jefferson. Based on characters with similar jobs in the other fictions, he is most likely black, but that is not specified.  He drives the hack, the rented carriage, that the Compsons rent for Mr. Compson's funeral, and then, in exchange for a couple of cigars, drives it again so that Jason can show Caddy's child to her.</p>","Yes"
"21672","1645","Mike","Mike","","<p>Mike is presumably the owner of the Boston gym where Gerald Bland has been learning to box.  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Shreve tells Spoade that Bland has ""been going to Mike's every day, over in town"" (166).</p>","No"
"21671","1644","Mac","Mac","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Mac is a baseball fan who is at the drugstore in Jefferson when Jason goes there to buy cigars. He has his money on the New York Yankees.</p>","Yes"
"21670","1643","Louis","Louis","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Mrs. Compson tells Quentin that ""Louis has been giving [Caddy] lessons every morning"" in driving a car (93).  It is very unlikely that ""Louis"" here is the ""Louis Hatcher"" with whom Quentin goes hunting twenty years earlier, because that ""Louis"" is an old black man who carries but won't even use a hunting horn.  Who Mrs. Compson's ""Louis"" is, however, or how he learned to drive an automobile in 1910 is never made any clearer.</p>","Yes"
"21669","1642","Kenny","Kenny","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Kenny is one of the ""three boys with fishing poles"" Quentin first encounters on the bridge where he hides the flat irons (122).  This may be the one that the narrative consistently refers to as ""the first boy"" (122).  He wears a ""broken hat"" (123) and seems to hold himself a bit apart from the other two boys.  Quentin tries talking with him after they leave him, but ""he paid me no attention"" (123).  He seems to have rejoined his friends by the time Quentin sees them again, swimming in the river.  He is also probably one of the three boys who are present when Quentin is arrested by Anse and brought before the Squire.</p>","No"
"21668","1641","Professor Junkin","Junkin, Professor","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Mrs. Compson names ""Professor Junkin"" as the person at the Jefferson school who called to tell her that her granddaughter Quentin has been truant.  He is either Quentin's teacher or the school principal or, since it is a fairly small school, perhaps both.</p>","Yes"
"21667","1640","Julio","Julio","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Julio is the older brother of the unnamed Italian girl whom Quentin tries to escort safely home from the bakery.  Julio attacks Quentin, thinking that Quentin has tried to kidnap his sister, or as Julio himself puts it: ""I killa heem . . . [he] steala my seester"" (139).  At the Squire's office Julio wants to press kidnapping charges, but instead accepts money from Quentin as compensation for the time he lost at work while chasing after him.</p>","No"
"21666","1639","Hopkins","Hopkins","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Hopkins is one of the men in Jefferson who trade on the cotton commodities market in New York by means of the telegraph. He is in the telegraph office when Jason drops in, and with Jason he discusses trading strategy.</p>","Yes"
"21665","1638","Miss Holmes","Holmes, Miss","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Miss Holmes is one of two young women on a pleasure outing with Mrs. Bland, Gerald, Spoade and Shreve when Quentin is arrested for kidnapping the unnamed Italian girl.  Quentin notes that she and Miss Daingerfield, the other young woman,  have ""little white noses"" (145) and look at him ""through veils, with a kind of delicate horror"" (141).</p>","No"
"21664","1637","Martha Hatcher","Hatcher, Martha","","<p>Martha is the wife of Louis Hatcher in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>.  He tells Quentin that his wife was afraid the Johnstown flood in Pennsylvania could reach Mississippi.</p>","Yes"
"21663","1636","Louis Hatcher","Hatcher, Louis","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Louis Hatcher is an elderly black man who goes possum hunting with Quentin and Versh on a windless October night.  Thinking of him, Quentin notes that he ""never even used his [hunting] horn carrying it"" (114).  He does use the lantern he carries, but the last time he cleaned it, he tells Quentin, was during the 1889 flood in Johnstown, Pennsylvania; he and his wife Martha were afraid the flood waters would reach Yoknapatawpha.  It is possible but very unlikely that he is the ""Louis"" who teaches Caddy how to drive a car (93).</p>","Yes"
"21662","1635","Earl","Earl","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Earl owns the hardware store on the Square in Jefferson where Jason Compson works.  He tells Jason that Mrs. Compson is ""a lady I've got a lot of sympathy for"" (227), and apparently for her sake, he puts up with Jason's inadequacies as his employee.  When Earl re-appears in <em>The Mansion</em> he gains a last name but loses possession of the store: he manages it for Ike McCaslin, though since Ike ""spends most of his time"" fishing and hunting he essentially runs it until Jason ""eliminates Triplett in his turn"" (355).</p>","Yes"
"21661","1634","Deacon","Deacon","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Deacon is a fixture among the students at Harvard in 1910, especially the ones who come from the south.  Black and, according to Quentin, a ""natural psychologist"" (97), he meets these southerners when they first arrive in Cambridge, ""in a sort of Uncle Tom's cabin outfit, patches and all"" (97) and proceeds to manipulate their prejudices to his own benefit.  He tells Quentin that ""you and me's the same folks, come long and short,"" and that Southerners are ""fine folks. But you can't live with them"" (99).  He seems very much at home in the urban world of Boston.  Quentin remembers seeing him marching in two parades, and Deacon tells him, now that he has ""turned Democrat,"" the future looks even brighter: ""Wait till next year. . . . Then see where I'm marching"" (99).</p>","No"
"21660","1633","Miss Daingerfield","Daingerfield, Miss","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, Miss Daingerfield is one of two young women on a pleasure outing with Mrs. Bland, Gerald, Spoade and Shreve when Quentin is arrested for kidnapping the unnamed Italian girl.  Quentin notes that she and Miss Holmes, the other young woman,  have ""little white noses"" (145) and look at him ""through veils, with a kind of delicate horror"" (141).</p>","No"
"21659","1632","Sis Beulah Clay","Clay, Sis Beulah","","<p>Frony mentions ""Sis Beulah Clay"" to Caddy and her brothers in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> when she tries to explain what a ""funeral"" is (33).  When Sis Beulah Clay died, ""they moaned two days"" (33).  ""Sis"" implies this woman belonged to the same church as Dilsey's family.</p>","Yes"
"21658","1631","Charlie","Charlie","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Charlie is one of the boys with whom Caddy explores her sexual desires in adolescence, the only named one before Dalton Ames.   Charlie and Caddy are being intimate on the swing in the Compson backyard when Benjy interrupts them.  Charlie's reaction to Benjy's anguish is very callous: noting that her brother ""cant talk,"" he continues to ""put his hands on Caddy"" (47) and gets angry when Caddy leaves with Benjy.</p>","Yes"
"21657","1630","Mr. Burgess","Burgess, Mr.","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Mr. Burgess is the neighbor of the Compsons who sees Benjy grabbing at his daughter and rushes to ""knock him out with a fence picket"" (263).</p>","Yes"
"21656","1629","Anse 2","Anse 2","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Anse is the Marshal of the town near Cambridge where Quentin goes in the second half of his section.  He is described by Quentin as ""oldish,"" and he wears a vest with a badge on it and carries a ""knotted, polished stick"" (139).  Quentin is told to find him because he could help Quentin find the lost Italian girl's home. However, Anse found Quentin first; he arrested Quentin for trying to kidnap the lost Italian girl.</p>","No"
"21655","1628","Dalton Ames","Ames, Dalton","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Dalton Ames - a new arrival in Jefferson in the summer of 1909 - is the first man Caddy Compson has sex with, and may be the father of Caddy's daughter.  Caddy tells Quentin that Ames has ""been in the army had killed men"" (148) and ""crossed all the oceans all around the world"" (150).  Quentin discovers for himself how good Ames is with a pistol when he tries ordering him to leave town.  For more than one reason Quentin feels that Ames is not a proper suitor for Caddy, including the issue of class; his name, Quentin thinks, ""just missed gentility"" (92).  But that name - ""Dalton Ames. Dalton Ames. Dalton Ames."" - echoes throughout Quentin's thoughts on the last day of his life (79).</p>","Yes"
"21654","1627","Unnamed Youth","Unnamed Youth","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, while Bayard recovers from his first accident, this ""youth who hung around one of the garages in town"" drives his car to Memphis for repairs (267).</p>","Yes"
"21653","1626","Unnamed Woman in Mount Vernon","Unnamed Woman in Mount Vernon","","<p>This ""young woman"" is only mentioned once in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, as the person with whom Lee MacCallum is ""keeping company"" (i.e. courting, 350).</p>","Yes"
"21652","1625","Unnamed Young Man at Belle's 2","Unnamed Young Man at Belle's 2","","<p>This is the person referred to simply as ""another young man"" by the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em>; he comes by the Mitchell house to play tennis.  Harry Mitchell describes the set who congregate around his wife as ""a bunch of young girls and jelly-beans"" (193). (In the 1920s ""jellybean"" was a slang term for a young man who wore stylish clothes.)</p>","Yes"
"21651","1624","Unnamed Young Man at Belle's 1","Unnamed Young Man at Belle's 1","","<p>This ""youth in a battered ford"" drives by the Mitchell house to pick up ""the girl Frankie"" (193) in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>. He is probably part of the young set that congregates around Belle Mitchell, and that her husband Harry describes as ""a bunch of young girls and jelly-beans"" (193).  They seem to be just a few years younger than Horace or Bayard. (In the 1920s ""jellybean"" was a slang term for a young man who wore stylish clothes.)</p>","Yes"
"21650","1623","Unnamed Morale Worker","Unnamed Morale Worker","","<p>This is the woman whom Caspey calls ""one of dese army upliftin' ladies"" when he describes meeting her on an abandoned battle field in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (61).  During the War, women volunteered to give aid and comfort to the American doughboys through a variety of organizations, including the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and the YMCA.  All we are told about this woman is that she was looking for souvenirs, ""German bayonets and belt-buckles"" (61).</p>","No"
"21649","1622","Unnamed Woman in Chicago Nightclub 2","Unnamed Woman in Chicago Nightclub 2","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this young woman wears an expression of ""harried desperation"" as she sits with Harry Mitchell at the Chicago nightclub.  It seems that after getting Harry drunk, she steals his diamond tiepin; when the waiter apparently tries to stop her, her voice rises ""with a burst of filthy rage into a shrill hysterical scream"" (388).</p>","No"
"21648","1621","Unnamed Woman in Chicago Nightclub 1","Unnamed Woman in Chicago Nightclub 1","","<p>This young woman in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> is described as ""a slim, long thing, mostly legs apparently, with a bold red mouth and cold eyes"" (384).  She is Bayard's companion at the Chicago night club where he agrees to fly the experimental plane; her mouth may be bold, but she says she is afraid of him: ""He'll do anything"" (386).</p>","No"
"21647","1618","Unnamed Women College Students 1","Unnamed Women College Students 1","","<p>These are the young women in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who are in college in the neighboring town (obviously Oxford) whom Young Bayard (along with Mitch and Suratt and three Negro musicians) serenades.

"21643","1616","Unnamed White Soldiers","Unnamed White Soldiers","","<p>This entry represents the various unnamed white soldiers whom Caspey mentions in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> in his highly fictionalized account of his experiences in France during World War I.  Many of them are ""M.P""s, but he also refers to ""white officers"" and the ""white boys"" with whom he shares a trench about four miles behind the front lines (60).</p>","No"
"21642","1615","Unnamed New Yorker","Unnamed New Yorker","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, as an example of the trouble her great-great-nephews used to get into as college students visiting New York, Jenny mentions ""a policeman or a waiter or something"" to whom Old Bayard paid fifteen hundred dollars in compensation for ""something they did"" (381).</p>","No"
"21641","1614","Unnamed Venetian Glassmakers","Unnamed Venetian Glassmakers","","<p>Horace Benbow's description in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> of the glass-making craftsmen he saw in the caves of Venice is suitably picturesque: ""At first they're just shapeless things . . . shadows on the bloody walls . . . And then a face comes out, blowing . . ."" (165).</p>","No"
"21640","1613","Unnamed Union Soldiers 1","Unnamed Union Soldiers 1","","<p>In the story Aunt Jenny tells in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> about her brother Bayard's death on a cavalry raid with J.E.B. Stuart in Virginia, they ride back and forth several times through hundreds if not thousands of Union soldiers.  These soldiers include ""astonished picket-parties returning placidly to camp"" and ""fatigue parties setting forth with picks and axes and shovels"" (13); they are described most vividly as ""blue-clad pigmy shapes"" that ""plunge scattering before and beneath"" the force of twenty Confederates (14).</p>","No"
"21639","1612","Unnamed Union Cook","Unnamed Union Cook","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this cook is hiding inside General Pope's ""wrecked commissary tent"" when Carolina Bayard returns for the anchovies (18); the derringer shot he fires into Sartoris' back from his hiding place into Sartoris' back is fatal.</p>","No"
"21638","1611","Unnamed Texas Journalist","Unnamed Texas Journalist","","<p>As part of the biographical sketch in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> of the ""son of a carpenter"" whom Belle Mitchell ""makes a poet"" (181), we learn that he got his job ""on a Texas newspaper"" when the ""besotted young man"" who held the position resigned it to ""enlist in the Marine Corps early in '17"" - i.e. 1917, when the U.S. entered the First World War (182).</p>","No"
"21637","1610","Unnamed Telegraph Operator 2","Unnamed Telegraph Operator 2","","<p>Jefferson's telegraph operator in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> not only dispenses telegrams but provides updates on the cotton market.

"21636","1609","Unnamed Telegraph Operator 1","Unnamed Telegraph Operator 1","","<p>This is the diffident ""young man"" (according to Miss Jenny, at least) works as the Jefferson telegraph operator in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (392).  Because he knows, as Jenny does not, that Bayard has died, he doesn't know what to do after she hands him a telegram to send to Bayard.</p>","Yes"

"21634","1607","Unnamed Spirits of the Old South","Unnamed Spirits of the Old South","","<p>These 'characters' are the ghostly presences that, according to the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, still haunt the darkened and seldom-used parlor at the Sartoris plantation house: ""figures in crinoline and hooped muslin and silk,"" and ""in gray too, with crimson sashes and sabres"" (56).  They seem to be conjured up by Narcissa Benbow's piano playing.</p>","Yes"
"21633","1606","Unnamed Carpenter 1","Unnamed Carpenter 1","","<p>This man appears in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> only when the novel identifies the ""youth"" who is Belle Mitchell's protege as the ""son of a carpenter"" (181).</p>","Yes"
"21631","1605","Unnamed Young Writer","Unnamed Young Writer","Unnamed Carpenter 1","<p>Identified as the ""son of a carpenter,"" this ""youth"" in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> occupies only half a paragraph of text, but his story contains a number of intriguing details (181).   Despite his blue-collar origin, Belle Mitchell decides to ""make a poet"" of him, and sends him to New Orleans presumably as part of that process (181).  Faulkner also wanted to be a poet, and went to New Orleans at the start of his writing career.  The new stories diverge, however, when this ""youth"" becomes a ""conscientious objector"" at the start of the war, and moves to Texas where he ""now serves in a reportorial capacity"" (182).</p>","Yes"
"21630","1604","Unnamed Slave of J.E.B. Stuart","Unnamed Slave of J.E.B. Stuart","","<p>Described by the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> as ""the General's body servant,"" this unnamed slave provides a kind of sound track to Aunt Jenny's story of Stuart and Carolina Bayard as ""two angels valiantly fallen"": he strums a ""guitar in lingering random chords"" at the Confederate unit's camp (12).</p>","No"
"21629","1603","Unnamed Ship Captain 1","Unnamed Ship Captain 1","","<p>The captain of the ship that carries Horace back to the U.S. in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> seems fairly phlegmatic: when Horace's glass-blowing starts a fire in his cabin on board, at least according to Horace's account, he ""decides that I'd better not try it again"" until the reach land (138).</p>","No"
"21628","1602","Unnamed Select Young Girls","Unnamed  Select Young Girls","","<p>According to the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, ""each spring"" a ""certain few young girls"" are allowed to pick flowers from the lawn at the Benbow house (164).  Since they ""ask permission"" we can infer that they are polite (164).  Their class status can be inferred from the first two adjectives that the narrator uses to describe them.</p>","Yes"
"21627","1601","Unnamed Second Husband of Joan Heppleton","Unnamed Second Husband of Joan Heppleton","","<p>Identified in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> only as ""young,"" ""American,"" and an ""employee of the Standard oil company,"" he and Joan Heppleton are married for one year, presumably living in Calcutta where she meets him (321).

"21626","1600","Unnamed Scottish Engineer","Unnamed Scottish Engineer","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this man and Colonel Sartoris met while they were both servng in the Mexican War.  After the Civil War, Sartoris brings him to Yoknapatawpha to help with the building of the railroad.

"21625","1599","Unnamed Robber","Unnamed Robber","","<p>One of the men Colonel Sartoris kills in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> is called ""that robber"" by Will Fall; the context suggests he was trying to rob the money Sartoris carried as he was building the railroad through Yoknapatawpha.  (This character and ""that other feller"" Sartoris kills in this novel seem combined into the character of the unnamed ""hill man"" in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, 23.)</p>","Yes"
"21624","1598","Unnamed Residents of the Poorhouse 1","Unnamed Residents of the Poorhouse 1","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Will Falls distributes the ""pint of whisky"" that is always part of the Thanksgiving and Christmas gift baskets given him by the Sartorises ""among his ancient and homeless cronies"" (301) in the county poorhouse.</p>","Yes"
"21623","1597","Unnamed Residents of Horace's New Town","Unnamed Residents of Horace's New Town","","<p><em>Flags in the Dust</em> characterizes the residents of Horace's new 'home' town - where he is clearly in exile - negatively.  They have turned a Mississippi hamlet into a prosperous but squalid town.  The engine of its economy is a factory making an unspecified product from the local cypress trees, which are all being chopped down.  The narrator labels this populace with a series of pejorative terms, including ""brigands"" and ""bugs"" (373).</p>","No"
"21622","1596","Unnamed Children at Play","Unnamed Children at Play","","<p>This represents four different groups of children in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>: (1) The children playing in the street whom Bayard, riding the wild stallion,  swerves to avoid running into; only one is individualized: ""a small figure in a white shirt and diminutive pale blue pants"" (130).  (2) The ""neighbors' children"" who play ""quietly"" among the flowers and trees on the lawn at the Benbow house (164).  (3) The children playing ""quietly and a little stiffly"" in the cemetery that Jenny and Isom visit at the end of the novel (399).  All these groups appear in Jefferson.  In addition, when Bayard reaches the town outside Yoknapatawpha on Christmas, he sees ""children in bright sweaters and jackets"" in the streets, playing ""on shiny coasters and skates and wagons"" (368).</p>","Yes"
"21621","1595","Unnamed People Who Had Known Joan as a Child","Unnamed People Who Had Known Joan as a Child","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Joan Heppleton goes back to her family's home town ""from time to time"" after her globe-trotting experiences, where she attracts the stares of the ""neighbors, older people who had known her all her life,"" the younger people she had grown up with, and ""newcomers to the town"" (322).  The narrative never says where ""home"" is (in <em>Sanctuary</em> we hear that Belle is from Kentucky), but it seems to be like Jefferson in the sense that Joan's obviously modern, emancipated behavior and appearance is something new and disconcerting.</p>","No"
"21620","1594","Unnamed People in Unnamed Town","Unnamed People in Unnamed Town","","<p>These are the various inhabitants of the town in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> from which Young Bayard catches the train that takes him into exile.  When he looks at them at the end of Christmas day, he sees various ""cheerful groups,"" including children playing with new presents, youths exploding fireworks, and travelers waiting with friends in the racially segregated ""waiting rooms"" at the station (369).</p>","No"
"21619","1593","Unnamed People in Oxford 1","Unnamed People in Oxford 1","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, when Bayard drives north to the university town where his passengers will serenade the women students, they go through the ""streets identical with those at home"" (142) - which may be Faulkner's covert way of acknowledging that Jefferson is based closely on Oxford, where he is writing the novel.  When Bayard reaches ""an identical square,"" ""people on the square"" turn to look at the car, with three young white men in front and three black musicians in back, ""curiously"" (142).  That reaction, however, is all that we learn about the people who live in Oxford.</p>","No"
"21618","1592","Unnamed Patients of Doctor Peabody","Unnamed Patients of Doctor Peabody","","<p>As part of the description of Doctor Peabody in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, the narrative mentions his willingness to travel any distance ""to visit anyone, white or black, who sent for him"" (95).  Later in the description a few of his patients are particularized when a ""countryman"" - that is, someone from outside the town of Jefferson - visits Peabody in his office to pay the doctor's bill ""incurred by his father or grandfather"" (95).</p>","Yes"
"21617","1591","Unnamed Old Jefferson Lady","Unnamed Old Jefferson Lady","","<p>Mentioned only in passing in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, she is the charitable ""old lady of the town"" in whose automobile the wife and children of the ""family of country people"" (also unnamed) take their husband and father to the train station, where he leaves for the War (72).</p>","Yes"
"21616","1590","Unnamed Baby of Countryman","Unnamed Baby of Countryman","Unnamed Countryman 2, Unnamed Countrywoman 1","<p>The child (neither name nor gender is mentioned) who is born into the ""family of country people"" who are living in Jefferson and being looked after by the Red Cross and Narcissa Benbow in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (72).</p>","Yes"
"21615","1589","Unnamed New York Police Chief","Unnamed New York Police Chief","","<p>According to Miss Jenny's account in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, it is ""the chief of police in New York"" who writes to Bayard and John's college instructors to complain about the young men's misbehavior in the city (381).</p>","No"
"21614","1588","Unnamed Negroes in Wagons","Unnamed Negroes in Wagons","","<p>At several different points in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Young Bayard is described frightening these men, women and children - country Negroes whose slow-moving, mule-drawn wagons he threatens and sometimes overturns by rushing up to them in the powerful car he speeds around the county in.  The people in the wagons are never named or individualized, except by their alarmed faces and rolling eyes.</p>","Yes"
"21613","1587","Unnamed Negro Yardmen 1","Unnamed Negro Yardmen 1","","<p>These are the two unnamed black men in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> whom Bayard, trying to avoid a white child, swerves toward on his wild stallion ride through Jefferson.  Since one is ""playing a hose on the sidewalk"" and the other is holding ""a pitchfork,"" it seems safe to identify them as yardmen working for one of the white families who live on this ""quiet"" street (130).  They are not injured, though Bayard is when the horse slips on the wet concrete; the ""negro with the pitchfork"" drives the stallion away from Bayard's fallen body (131).</p>","Yes"
"21612","1586","Unnamed Negro Trainhand","Unnamed Negro Trainhand","","<p>This is one of ""two negroes"" in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> - the other is Sol - who help Horace unload his baggage from the train on which he returns to Jefferson (157).</p>","Yes"
"21611","1585","Unnamed Negro Soldiers","Unnamed Negro Soldiers","","<p>These are the other black soldiers whom Caspey Strother mentions in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> in the stories he brings home from World War I.  He never mentions any of their names, usually referring to them as ""boys,"" but he does refer specifically to two: ""de Captain's dog-robber"" and ""a school boy"" (59).  (It's unclear what Caspey means by ""dog-robber,"" but he may be mangling the term 'dogsbody' - a British term for a person who does minor tasks; as an officer, the ""Captain"" in the phrase would be likely to have someone in such a menial role.  Caspey's stories are obviously wild exaggerations, if not outright inventions, but over 350,000 African Americans - enlisted men, draftees and officers - served during the war, and many of them, though probably not Caspey, saw combat in one of the two all-black divisions created by the U.S. Army.)</p>","No"
"21610","1584","Unnamed Negro Section Hand","Unnamed Negro Section Hand","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, this railroad worker - referred to by Simon simply as a ""section hand"" (7) - is apparently the only witness to Young Bayard's 1919 return to Jefferson from World War I.  It seems that he told Simon about it, and Simon in turn tells Old Bayard.</p>","Yes"
"21609","1583","Unnamed Negro Paving Crew 1","Unnamed Negro Paving Crew 1","","<p>Perhaps as another symptom of the ""newness"" of the town Horace and Belle move to in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> after her divorce, on his way back from the railroad station he notes that the street is ""uptorn . . . in the throes of being paved"" (376).  The ""lines of negroes"" doing the work ""swing their tools in a languid rhythm,"" singing ""snatches of plaintive minor chanting punctuated by short grunting ejaculations"" (376).  Since they explicitly work in ""lines,"" this may be a chain gang, and the men may be convict laborers, but that is not said explicitly.</p>","No"
"21608","1582","Unnamed Negro Parson","Unnamed Negro Parson","","<p>This is the imposing-looking Pastor of the Second Baptist Church in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who leads the delegation that calls on Old Bayard Sartoris, requesting him to pay back to the church the $67.40 that Simon embezzled from the building fund.  The narrator describes him as ""a huge, neckless negro in a Prince Albert coat . . . with an orotund air and a wild, compelling eye"" (282).</p>","Yes"
"21607","1581","Unnamed Negro Musician 2","Unnamed Negro Musician 2","","<p>One of the ""three negroes"" in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who accompany Young Bayard on his drunken trip to the neighboring college town to serenade the co-eds.  He plays either the bass viol or the guitar.</p>","Yes"
"21606","1580","Unnamed Negro Musician 1","Unnamed Negro Musician 1","","<p>One of the ""three negroes"" in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who accompany Young Bayard on his drunken trip to the neighboring college town to serenade the co-eds.  He plays either the bass viol or the guitar.</p>","Yes"
"21605","1579","Unnamed Negro at Mitchells","Unnamed Negro at Mitchells","","<p><em>Flags in the Dust</em> describes this man as ""the combination gardener-stableman-chauffeur"" at the Mitchells and once as ""the house-yard-stable boy,"" but does not otherwise describe him (189).  He takes over some of Meloney Harris' tasks after she quits as Belle's maid.</p>","Yes"
"21604","1578","Unnamed Negro Churchmember 3","Unnamed Negro Churchmember 3","","<p>One of the six members of the Second Baptist Church who call at the Sartoris plantation in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> seeking restitution of the $67.40 that Simon has embezzled from the building fund.</p>","Yes"

"21602","1576","Unnamed Negro Churchmember 1","Unnamed Negro Churchmember 1","","<p>One of the six members of the Second Baptist Church who call at the Sartoris plantation in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> seeking restitution of the $67.40 that Simon has embezzled from the building fund.</p>","Yes"
"21601","1575","Unnamed Negro Child 3","Unnamed Negro Child 3","","<p>The youngest of the three children of the black sharecroppers in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who let Young Bayard sleep in their barn and share their Christmas dinner; ""too small to walk . . . it crawl[s] about the floor in a sort of intense purposelessness"" (364).</p>","Yes"
"21600","1574","Unnamed Negro Child 2","Unnamed Negro Child 2","","<p>The middle child in the family of black sharecroppers in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who let Young Bayard sleep in their barn and share their Christmas dinner; of the gender of this child the narrative says only, and strangely, ""The second one might have been either or anything"" (364).</p>","Yes"
"21599","1573","Unnamed Negro Child 1","Unnamed Negro Child 1","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this is the ""small negro child clutching a stick of striped candy"" that Bayard has to jump the stallion over as it bolts away from the livery stable (129-30).</p>","Yes"
"21598","1572","Unnamed Negro at MacCallums","Unnamed Negro at MacCallums","","<p>One of the three black men in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (the others are Richard, and an unnamed ""half-grown negro boy"") who live with the MacCallums, presumably as servants or tenant farmers, or he may be the ""negro who assists"" Henry make moonshine whiskey (335).</p>","Yes"
"21597","1571","Unnamed Negro Brother-in-Law","Unnamed Negro Brother-in-Law","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> the black man in whose barn Bayard spends Christmas eve tells him that his ""brudder-in-law"" borrowed his mules, and so Bayard will have to wait for a ride to the next town (365).  When the mules ""miraculously"" appear later on Christmas day, the narrator refers to the ""yet uncorporeal brother-in-law"" (366) - seeming to imply that the Negro invented him.</p>","Yes"
"21596","1570","Unnamed Negress","Unnamed Negress","","<p>""Negress"" is not a term the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> uses for any other female Negro, so it's not clear why he uses it the one time he mentions the black maid at the Beard boarding house.  She is helping Mrs. Beard serve breakfast at the boarding house.  She is also described as  ""slatternly"" (324).</p>","Yes"
"21593","1569","Unnamed Music Teacher","Unnamed Music Teacher","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Little Belle Mitchell's piano teacher, who assists her during her recital, runs closely to type: ""a thin, passionate spinster with cold thwarted eyes behind nose glasses"" (200).</p>","Yes"
"21592","1568","Unnamed Men at Livery Stable","Unnamed Men at Livery Stable","","<p>At the livery stable where Rafe takes Bayard in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> are a number of ""onlookers"" (129) sitting ""on top of the gate"" or ""leaning with crossed arms upon it"" (126).  Presumably they are admiring the stallion in the lot, though when its runs away with Bayard by crashing right through the gate they ""hurl themselves to safety"" (129).</p>","Yes"
"21591","1567","Unnamed Memphis Specialist","Unnamed Memphis Specialist","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Dr. Brandt shares his Memphis office with at least one other medical ""specialist,"" who is described as ""large,"" ""with a majestic, surreptitious air like a royal undertaker"" (246).</p>","No"
"21590","1566","Unnamed Memphis Recruiting Officer","Unnamed Memphis Recruiting Officer","","<p>This is the serviceman in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> whom Montgomery Ward Snopes cons into declaring him medically unfit for military service by holding ""a plug of chewing tobacco beneath his left armpit"" all the way from Jefferson to Memphis (167).</p>","No"
"21589","1565","Unnamed Memphis Friends of Young Bayard","Unnamed Memphis Friends of Young Bayard","","<p>In Miss Jenny's account in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> of the wedding and newlywed life that Bayard and Caroline live in Memphis, she mentions ""the [aviation] pupils of Bayard's"" and his ""soldier friends"" whom she sees.  Like their wives, whom Jenny calls ""young women who ought to have been at home,"" these are all obviously members of the same ""lost"" generation as Bayard (51).</p>","No"
"21588","1564","Unnamed Marine Private","Unnamed Marine Private","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> the insignia on this marine's uniform identifies him as belonging to the Second Marine Division, which saw heavy combat during World War I; he expresses his contempt for Horace's Y.M.C.A. uniform, which marks him as a non-combatant, by ""making a vulgar sound of derogation"" and spitting, ""not exactly at Horace's feet, and not exactly anywhere else"" (158-59).</p>","Yes"
"21587","1563","Unnamed London Girl","Unnamed London Girl","","<p>In the story Monaghan tells in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> about the War, this ""girl"" accompanies Bayard Sartoris to a ""dive"" in London while he is in England training as an aviator.  She becomes the occasion for one of Bayard's barroom fights when an Australian captain ""just tries to speak to"" her (385).  (See also the entry in this index for Unnamed Leicester Women.)</p>","No"
"21586","1562","Unnamed Little Girls","Unnamed Little Girls","","<p>These are ""the little girls next door"" with whom Little Belle plays in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>; they listen ""with respect coldly concealed"" when she tells them about the ""prettier town"" in which she used to live with ""her real daddy"" (378).</p>","Yes"
"21585","1561","Unnamed Leicester Women","Unnamed Leicester Women","","<p>These ""two ladies"" appear in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> in one of the stories young Bayard brings back from the War.  Apparently these women were the occasion for a fight in a bar between Bayard and an ""Australian major"" (124).  ""Ladies"" is certainly being used ironically, but whether the women are simply lower class, or working prostitutes, cannot be established from the text or the context.  (See also the entry in this index for Unnamed London Girl.)</p>","No"
"21583","1560","Unnamed Horse Trader","Unnamed Horse Trader","","<p>This ""horse trader by profession"" in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> has the usual unscrupulousness of that profession (127). The fact that ""he was usually engaged in litigation with the railroad company over the violent demise of some of his stock by its agency"" makes him very similar to I.O. Snopes in ""Mule in the Yard."" (In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> I.O. runs Flem's restaurant.)</p>","Yes"
"21582","1559","Unnamed Mother of Belle and Joan","Unnamed Mother of Belle and Joan","","<p>Mentioned only briefly in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, in the summary account of Joan Heppleton's life, the woman who is both her and Belle Mitchell's mother is identified by her ""ready tearful uncomplaint"" (322).</p>","No"
"21581","1558","Unnamed Countrywomen from Frenchman's Bend","Unnamed Countrywomen from Frenchman's Bend","","<p>The anonymous hillman in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who moves into Jefferson and builds the house Belle Mitchell lives in came to town with his unnamed and unenumerated ""women-folks"" (24).  In their new lives these women obviously attempt to live like 'ladies': they spend the mornings sitting on the veranda and the afternoons riding about wearing ""colored silks"" (24).  But after two years, they return to Frenchman's Bend and, the narrator speculates, their original 'poor white' identities.</p>","Yes"
"21580","1557","Unnamed Hill Man 1","Unnamed Hill Man 1","","<p>The house that the Mitchells live in was built, the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> notes, by ""a hillman who moved in [to Jefferson] from a small settlement called Frenchman's Bend"" (24).  Unlike the houses of the town's older families, the house he builds is conspicuously close to the street, which leads Miss Jenny to say he ""built the handsomest house in Frenchman's Bend on the most beautiful lot in Jefferson"" (24).  Like Flem Snopes, this unnamed hillman begins as a ""poor white,"" though somehow acquires enough wealth to build the house; unlike Flem, he abandons his attempt to move up in class after two years and moves back ""to the country"" (24).</p>","Yes"
"21579","1556","Unnamed Half-Grown Negro Boy","Unnamed Half-Grown Negro Boy","","<p>One of the three black males who are present in the MacCallum household when Young Bayard arrives there near the end of <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  His role in the family or on the family's land is not clear.</p>","Yes"
"21578","1555","Unnamed Guests at Belle's Recital","Unnamed Guests at Belle's Recital","","<p>""The group of Belle's more intimate familiars"" who attend Little Belle's recital in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> seem a bit older than the young set that gathers at the Mitchells' tennis court (198), but the narrator does not characterize them with any more sympathy.  The group is dominated by the voices of the ""ladies,"" ""sibilantly crescendic,"" ""an hysterical tideflux"" (198).  The ""occasional soberly clad male"" remains at the periphery of this ""chattering"" (198) and ""gabbling"" (202).</p>","Yes"
"21577","1554","Unnamed Group of Negroes 1","Unnamed Group of Negroes 1","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this ""group of negroes"" scatters when Bayard and the runaway stallion race down the lane from the livery stable (129).</p>","Yes"
"21576","1553","Unnamed Grandmother of Will Falls","Unnamed Grandmother of Will Falls","","<p>This unnamed woman in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> is, according to Will Falls, his source for the ointment with which he is treating Old Bayard's wen: ""My granny got that 'ere from a Choctaw woman nigh a hundred and thutty year ago"" (227).</p>","Yes"
"21575","1552","Unnamed Governor of South Carolina","Unnamed Governor of South Carolina","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, the ""governor"" of South Carolina at the start of the Civil War - when the state became the first to secede from the Union, occupied Fort Moultrie and ""refused to surrender it"" (11), and then began hostilities by attacking Fort Sumter - was Frances Pickens; descended from a famous Carolina family, he strongly supported the creation and the cause of the Confederacy.</p>","No"
"21574","1551","Unnamed Man Driving Ford","Unnamed Man Driving Ford","","<p>More a symbol of modernity than a character in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, this man is driving badly and wearing ""a woman's stocking wrapped about his head and tied beneath his hat"" when he swerves into the path of Young Bayard's car, causing the accident in which Old Bayard dies (326).</p>","Yes"
"21573","1550","Unnamed First Husband of Joan Heppleton","Unnamed First Husband of Joan Heppleton","","<p>Mentioned a couple times in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, briefly, in the history of her ""lovers"" that Joan Heppleton provides for Horace Benbow, this man (probably not named ""Heppleton,"" but not otherwise named) was in his fifties when she married him at eighteen.  Together they went to Hawaii just before or during the First World I; after she left him for another man, they divorced and he ""made a settlement on her"" (322).</p>","No"
"21572","1549","Unnamed ""Feller"" 1","Unnamed ""Feller"" 1","","<p>He is mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> by Old Man Falls simply as ""that other feller"" Colonel John Sartoris killed sometime after the Civil War, ""when he had to start killin' folks"" (23).  (He may be the same character as the ""hill man Sartoris kills in <em>The Unvanquished</em> [221], but that is not clear.)</p>","Yes"
"21571","1548","Unnamed Father of Belle and Joan","Unnamed Father of Belle and Joan","","<p>Mentioned only briefly in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, while the narrative is summing up Joan Heppleton's life, the man who is both her and Belle Mitchell's father is identified with the quality of ""bitter reserve"" (322).  The reference to him in <em>Sanctuary</em> adds the detail that he lives ""in Kentucky""; Belle stays there with him, offstage, more most of the novel  (260).</p>","No"
"21570","1547","Unnamed Express Agent","Unnamed Express Agent","","<p>This is the non-descript employee at the ""new, ugly yellow station"" in the town Horace and Belle are living in at the end of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (373).</p>","No"
"21569","1546","Unnamed Expelled Undergraduate","Unnamed Expelled Undergraduate","","<p>Although <em>Flags in the Dust</em> does not describe this ""youth"" in any detail, it does specify the ""practical joke"" for which he was expelled ""from the state university"": ""he had removed the red lantern from the barrier about a street excavation and hung it above the door of the girls' dormitory"" (186).</p>","Yes"
"21568","1545","Unnamed Enslaved Musicians","Unnamed Enslaved Musicians","","<p>As part of its account of the history of the parlor in the Sartoris mansion, <em>Flags in the Dust</em> mentions ""three negroes with stringed instruments on the stairway"" inside the house who provided the music at the many antebellum dinners and occasional balls that Colonel John held in the room (55).</p>","Yes"
"21567","1544","Unnamed English Servant","Unnamed English Servant","","<p>The ""servant"" in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who ""methodically"" packs up Horace Benbow's possessions as he is getting ready to leave Oxford to return to America (178).</p>","No"
"21566","1543","Unnamed English Lover of Joan Heppleton","Unnamed English Lover of Joan Heppleton","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this is the man for whom Joan Heppleton leaves her husband and goes to Australia.  While living there she assumed his name, but since she married again later that name might not have been Heppleton.  The narrator sums his character up by saying ""no Englishman out of his native island has any honor about women"" (321); at some point the pair went to India, where he deserted Joan in Bombay.</p>","No"
"21565","1542","Unnamed Carolina Indians","Unnamed Carolina Indians","","<p>When in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Old Bayard finds his ancestor's rapier in the chest of family relics, he thinks of the first Sartoris in the new world, raising tobacco and fighting ""his stealthy and simple neighbors"" (88).  That ancestor lived in Carolina (whether North or more probably South is never specified), and the adjectives ""stealthy and simple"" make it almost certain that he is thinking about the Indians who were ab-originally on that scene.</p>","No"
"21564","1541","Unnamed Countryman 1","Unnamed Countryman 1","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this ""young man"" moves from the country into Jefferson during World War I; he is identified as ""steady"" and ""exemplary,"" poor but with ""a desire to get on"" (72).

In his absence the Red Cross and Narcissa Benbow take care of his wife and children.</p>","Yes"
"21563","1540","Unnamed Country Children","Unnamed County Children","Unnamed Countrywoman 1, Unnamed Countryman 1","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, these are the two ""infant children"" - sex not specified - in the ""family of country people"" that moves into Jefferson during the First World War (72).  Since their mother is pregnant again, ""infant"" presumably means something like ""less than three years old.""</p>","Yes"
"21562","1539","Unnamed Yoknapatawpha Cotton Growers","Unnamed Yoknapatawpha Cotton Growers","","<p>Cotton is the main crop of Yoknapatawpha, and as <em>Flags in the Dust</em> points out, it is raised by two very different kinds of growers - planters or croppers - on two very different kinds of land: the ""other planters further up the valley"" from the Sartorises own the county's rich bottom land, while the ""smaller croppers"" have to manage ""with their tilted fields among the hills"" (289).  The ""croppers"" are tenant farmers, who work land that is owned by someone else with whom they share their crop, and not all of them are in the hills: the rich land in the heart of the valley that the Sartorises own, for example, is ""farmed on shares"" (289).</p>","Yes"
"21561","1538","Unnamed College Professors 1","Unnamed College Professors 1","","<p>These are Bayard's teachers at the University of Virginia, and Johnny's at Princeton, who in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> are informed about the kinds of trouble that the twins get into in New York City.</p>","No"
"21560","1537","Unnamed Clients of Horace Benbow","Unnamed Clients of Horace Benbow","","<p>From the little that is said about them in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, it seems that the law practice that Horace Benbow inherits from his father Will serves mainly if not exclusively the aristocracy of Yoknapatawpha.  He meets ""conferees"" ""across pleasant dinner tables or upon golf links or . . . upon tennis courts""; he conserves the will's of ""testators"" who spend their lives ""in black silk and lace caps"" (179).</p>","Yes"
"21559","1536","Unnamed Choctaw Woman","Unnamed Choctaw Woman","","<p>The only native American character mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, this ""Choctaw woman"" gave Will Falls' grandmother the recipe for an ointment ""nigh a hundred and thutty years ago"" (227).  That would be around 1790, at which time the Choctaw was one of the major tribes living in the southeastern U.S, including Mississippi.  They inhabit Yoknapatawpha in Faulkner's earliest fictions.  However, historically the tribe that lived in the area of Yoknapatawpha was the Chickasaw, and in his later fictions Faulkner uses that name instead.  Both tribes were 'removed' to Oklahoma via the Trail of Tears in the 1830s, but a small number of Choctaw were allowed to remain in Mississippi.</p>","Yes"
"21558","1535","Unnamed Carnival Man","Unnamed Carnival Man","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this is the ""carnival man"" who explains how to fly a hot air balloon to Johnny Sartoris - or at least tries to (67).</p>","Yes"
"21557","1534","Unnamed Carnival Balloonist","Unnamed Carnival Balloonist","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this carnival employee is mentioned in Narcissa's account of the time Johnny Sartoris flew over Yoknapatawpha in a balloon.  John does that when ptomaine poisoning makes the man to ill to fly the balloon himself.</p>","Yes"
"21556","1533","Unnamed Businessmen in Horace's New Town","Unnamed Businessmen in Horace's New Town","","<p>These are the various businessmen in the town where Horace lives at the end of <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  On his walk to the train station he sees and greets ""merchants, another lawyer, his barber"" and ""a young man who was trying to sell him a car"" (374).</p>","No"
"21555","1532","Unnamed Jefferson Businessmen","Unnamed Jefferson Businessmen","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> the men who own businesses or have offices or work in stores on the Square appear several times, specifically separated out from the larger population of Jefferson.  They most frequently are associated with either Old Bayard or Jenny Du Pre.  ""A merchant or so in the adjacent doorways"" salute Bayard as he leaves the bank at the end of his day (5); when Jenny walks Bayard along the street to the doctor's ""merchants and others speak to her as to a martial queen"" (91); as Bayard goes into the bank at noon we see ""the dinnerward exodus of lawyers and merchants and clerks"" from those adjacent buildings (103); and so on.</p>","Yes"
"21554","1531","Unnamed Boys and Girls","Unnamed Boys and Girls","","<p>These are the anonymous ""boys and girls"" in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who ""lingered on spring and summer nights"" among the birds and bushes in the lot on which the unnamed ""hillman"" later built his home (25).</p>","Yes"
"21552","1530","Unnamed Blind Negro Musician","Unnamed Blind Negro Musician","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this man sits in front of Rogers' restaurant, ""a man of at least forty"" who is wearing a motley collection of uniforms and playing a guitar and harmonica (which the narrative calls a ""mouthorgan,"" 118).   The narrative describes what he plays as ""a plaintive reiteration of rich monotonous chords, rhythymic as a mathematical formula but without music"" (118).  The tin cup at his feet contains ""a dime and three pennies"" (118).</p>","Yes"
"21551","1529","Unnamed Bank Director","Unnamed Bank Director","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> he is an undescribed man who has a Coca-Cola with Res and Byron inside the bank.</p>","Yes"
"21550","1528","Unnamed Railroad Baggage Clerk 1","Unnamed Railroad Baggage Clerk 1","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this is the employee inside the train's baggage car.  His race is not specified, and his reply to Horace's concern about the fragility of his glass blowing equipment makes it hard to determine it.  Linguistically he sounds 'black': ""All right, colonel. . . . we ain't hurt her none, I reckon.  If we have, all you got to do is sue us"" (157).  But his unsubmissive attitude toward the white Horace suggests he is 'white' himself.</p>","Yes"
"21549","1527","Unnamed Aviator 1","Unnamed Aviator 1","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> this is the fellow aviator at the Dayton airfield who, after trying to talk Bayard out of flying the experimental plane, loans him a helmet and goggles, and offers him a woman's garter for luck.</p>","No"
"21548","1526","Unnamed Australian Major","Unnamed Australian Major","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Young Bayard mentions this major during his talk with Rafe MacCallum ""about the war""; the memory features a fight in ""the Leicester lounge"" in which ""the Anzac lost two teeth"" and Bayard himself ""got a black eye"" (124).  The fight may have been over ""two ladies,"" and may have been between Bayard and the Major, but none of that is made clear.  Faulkner may have meant this character to be the same as the Australian captain whose teeth Bayard knocks out in a bar in London (cf. 385) - in which case it might be another instance, like the tales Caspey brings home from France, of the unreliability of war stories.</p>","No"
"21547","1525","Unnamed Australian Captain","Unnamed Australian Captain","","<p>He is mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> by Monaghan, who says that during the Great War Young Bayard ""knocked two teeth"" out of this ""Australian captain"" in a fight over a girl in a ""London joint"" (385).   This officer's role closely resembles that of the unnamed Australian officer Bayard tells Rafe MacCallum about much earlier in the novel, but that officer was a major, and the nightclub was in Leicester.</p>","No"
"21546","1524","Unnamed Assistant Provost Marshal","Unnamed Assistant Provost Marshal","","<p>This very peripheral character is mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> in one of Monaghan's anecdotes about his experiences with Bayard Sartoris in World War I as the ""A.P.M."" whose whistle Comyn took and used to start a melee in an Amiens night club called the Cloche-Clos (387).  The Provost Marshals ran the army's military police.</p>","No"
"21545","1523","Unnamed Army Officers","Unnamed Army Officers","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, these are the ""white officers"" in charge of the African American ""labor battalion"" that Caspey Strother serves in during World War I (57).</p>","No"
"21544","1522","Unnamed American Students at Oxford","Unnamed American Students at Oxford","","<p>In its brief account of Horace's term as a Rhodes Scholar in England, <em>Flags in the Dust</em> mentions the ""fellow-countrymen"" with whom he occasionally travels on the ""Continent"" (177).</p>","No"
"21543","1521","Unnamed American Infantryman 2","Unnamed American Infantryman 2","","<p>The fellow soldier in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who calls Buddy MacCallum ""Virge"" at the New Jersey port from which they are shipping out for the War.  As he had done once before, in Arkansas, Buddy responds by fighting him ""steadily and thoroughly and without anger"" (355).</p>","No"
"21542","1520","Unnamed American Infantryman 1","Unnamed American Infantryman 1","","<p>The ""fellow recruit"" in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who calls Buddy MacCallum ""Virge"" during their training at a camp in Arkansas; in response Buddy fights him ""without anger"" for ""seven minutes"" (355).</p>","No"
"21541","1519","Unnamed Allied Aviators","Unnamed Allied Aviators","","<p>These are the pilots whom Young Bayard evokes in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> when he talks to Rafe MacCallum ""about the war""; the narrator describes them as ""young men like fallen angels, and of a meteoric violence like that of fallen angels"" (123).</p>","No"
"21537","1518","Sophia Wyatt","Wyatt, Sophia","","<p>Sally Wyatt's older sister is named Sophia in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>; she runs the household in which the three elderly Wyatt sisters live ""in a capable shrewish fashion"" (175).</p>","Yes"
"21536","1517","Miss Wyatt","Wyatt, Miss","","<p>The youngest of the three unmarried Wyatt sisters who live next door to the Benbows in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  She is not named, nor does she appear directly in the narrative.</p>","Yes"
"21535","1516","Captain Wyatt","Wyatt, Captain","","<p>One of the Confederate officers who rides with J.E.B. Stuart in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>; it is on his horse that the captured Union Major is carried.  (He does not seem to be related in any way to the Wyatt sisters who live next door to the Benbows in Jefferson.)</p>","No"
"21534","1515","Aunt Sally Wyatt","Wyatt, Aunt Sally","","<p>Though the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and both Benbows call her ""Aunt Sally,"" there is no sign of any nieces or nephews (168).  She is the neighbor and old family friend who stays with Narcissa while Horace is in France.  The narrator calls her ""a good old soul, but she lived much in the past, shutting her intelligence with a bland finality to anything which had occurred since 1901"" (168).</p>","Yes"
"21533","1514","Mrs. Winterbottom","Winterbottom, Mrs.","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> the woman who owns the boarding house in Jefferson where the two carpetbaggers are staying is named Mrs. Winterbottom.  According to Will Falls' story about the event, she stands ""gapin' after him with her mouth open"" when Colonel Sartoris goes up to their room and shoots them both (243).  (The third time Faulkner tells this story, in ""Skirmish at Satoris"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, the hotel is owned by Mrs. Holston.)</p>","Yes"
"21532","1513","Watts 1","Watts 1","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Watts is referred to as the owner of Jefferson's hardware store.  (As the Jefferson story continues to grow across the course of Faulkner's career, identifying the owner of this store becomes more and more confusing to data enterers like us; Watts is only mentioned in this first text.)</p>","Yes"
"21531","1512","Richthofen","Von Richthofen, Baron Manfred","","<p>Manfred von Richthofen, better known as ""The Red Baron,"" shot down more planes than any other aviator in World War I.  Young Bayard tells his grandfather and great-great-aunt that the German pilot who shot down Johnny was a ""pupil of Richthofen's"" (43).</p>","No"
"21530","1511","Sue","Sue","","<p>Either Hub's daughter or, less likely, his sister.  She does not appear in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, but Hub tells his wife that Sue will ""have to milk"" the cow because he is going to town with Bayard and Suratt (138).</p>","Yes"
"21529","1510","General J.E.B. Stuart","Stuart, General J.E.B.","","<p>James Ewell Brown ""Jeb"" Stuart was one of the most famous and flamboyant Confederate officers, in command of Lee's cavalry for most of the Civil War. In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> he and ""Carolina"" Bayard Sartoris, Stuart's friend and aide-de-camp, embody the spirit of chivalry and romantic daring that the narrative identifies with pre-Modern life. Aunt Jenny, who tells the highly-colored story about him and Bayard as mythic heroes, says she danced with Stuart once, before the war, in Baltimore.  Stuart appears a second time in the fictions in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, but Cass' reference to him in that novel is based on the most discreditable of his military excursions: when Stuart decided to ""ride his whole command around the biggest single armed force this continent ever saw"" (274) during Lee's invasion of the North in 1863, his absence from the battlefield at Gettysburg contributed to the Confederate defeat.</p>","No"
"21528","1509","Dr. Straud","Dr. Straud","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Dr. Straud is New York surgeon and medical researcher with whom Dr. Peabody's son, Lucius Jr., works.  The novel says his ""name is a household word"" (400), and Lucius says the doctor has ""been experimenting with electricity"" (401).</p>","No"
"21527","1508","Sol","Sol","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Sol is the porter who helps Horace with his luggage when he returns to Jefferson from France.</p>","Yes"
"21526","1507","Mrs. Smith","Smith, Mrs.","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Mrs. Smith  is characterized by her ""impregnable affability"" as the receptionist and switchboard operator at Dr. Brandt's office in Memphis(246).</p>","No"
"21525","1506","Sibleigh","Sibleigh","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Sibleigh serves in France with the Sartoris twins in the Royal Air Force during World War I.   He agrees to serve as flying bait to lure Ploeckner into Bayard's sights.  (He also appears in the non-Yoknapatawpha fiction ""With Honor and Dispatch."")</p>","No"
"21523","1505","Deacon Rogers","Rogers, Deacon","","<p>Deacon Rogers owns the store and restaurant on the Square in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>.  His physical description in the first novel is striking: ""His head was like an inverted egg; his hair curled meticulously away from the part in the center into two careful reddish-brown wings, like a toupee, and his eyes were a melting passionate brown"" (120).  His demeanor is ingratiating.  In the second novel, only his cafe is mentioned, not him.</p>","Yes"
"21522","1504","Richard","Richard","","<p>This is the named man among the ""two negro men"" and the boy in the MacCallum kitchen in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (336).  Mandy calls him ""Richud"" (337).  Buddy calls him ""Dick"" (338).  So it seems likely that his full name is Richard, though neither that nor his role in the household or on the family's land is spelled out.</p>","Yes"
"21521","1502","Res","Res","","<p>""A rotund man with bristling hair and lapping jowls like a Berkshire hog"" (102), Res is the cashier at Old Bayard's bank in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.</p>","Yes"
"21520","1503","Reno","Reno","","<p>The only named one among the three black musicians who accompany Young Bayard, Hub and Mitch on their trip to the neighboring college town to serenade young women in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Reno plays the clarinet.  He loses his hat when Bayard steps on the gas of his roadster.</p>","Yes"
"21519","1501","Sis Rachel","Rachel, Sis","","<p>Physically described as ""mountainous"" (26) and identified as one of Jefferson's best cooks in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>,  Rachel works for Belle and Harry Mitchell, and makes no effort to disguise her preference for Harry over his wife.</p>","Yes"
"21518","1500","General John Pope","Pope, General John","","<p>During the Civil War, General Pope was the general in command of the Union Army at the Second Battle of Bull Run in September, 1862.  The story Jenny tells in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> about her brother Bayard accompanying General J.E.B. Stuart's raiding party to Pope's headquarters in Virginia in April, 1862, forms a mythic part of the Sartoris inheritance.  In April 1862, however, Pope was in fact in Mississippi.  It was his success there that led Lincoln soon afterwards to bring Pope east and put him in command of the North's Army of Virginia.  He lost that position, however, after losing to Lee at Bull Run.  ""Pope"" is mentioned again in a list of Civil War generals in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> (188).</p>","No"
"21517","1499","Ploeckner","Ploeckner","","<p>According to what Bayard tells his family in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, the German pilot who shot down Johnny Sartoris in combat was named Ploeckner; ""one of the best they had,"" Bayard says (43), adding that he is one of the proteges of Manfred von Richthofen, the pilot known as the ""Red Baron.""  Ploeckner in turn shot down by Bayard.</p>","No"
"21516","1498","Mrs. Lucius Peabody","Peabody, Mrs. Lucius","","<p>Loosh Peabody married a woman he ""courted for fourteen years before he was able to marry her"" (400).  She lived somewhere ""forty miles"" away from Jefferson, outside Yoknapatawpha, and the demands of his patients meant that Peabody could not even see her as often as once a year.  We can infer she is patient and loyal, but all the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> says is that her ""only child"" is Lucius Peabody, Jr. (400).</p>","Yes"
"21515","1497","Dr. Lucius Peabody, Jr.","Peabody, Dr. Lucius Jr.","Doctor Lucius Peabody, Mrs. Lucius Peabody","<p>""Young Loosh,"" as the narrator calls the only child of Dr. Lucius Peabody, practices medicine as a surgeon in New York City, but at least once a year returns to spend a day with his father (400).  The description of him in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> is unusually detailed and enthusiastic. It begins: ""His face was big-boned and roughly molded.  He had a thatch of straight, stiff black hair and his eyes were steady and brown and his mouth was large; and in all his ugly face there was reliability and gentleness and humor . . ."" (400).  His father appears in eight fictions, but this is Young Loosh's only appearance in the canon.</p>","Yes"
"21514","1496","Pappy","Pappy","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> ""Pappy"" is the ""older negro"" (213) of the two who rescue Young Bayard after his car goes off the bridge and carry him home; he is suspicious both of meddling with a white man and of the automobile.  The ""younger negro"" is his son, John Henry (213).</p>","Yes"
"21513","1495","Brother Moore","Brother Moore","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Moore is the member of the delegation from the Second Baptist Church who formally, and reluctantly, reads out to Old Bayard the amount of money Simon owes the church building fund.  He is described as ""a small ebon negro in sombre, over-large black"" (284).</p>","Yes"
"21512","1494","Mitch","Mitch","","<p>One of the two ""young"" white men (the other is Hub) in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> who spend an evening with Young Bayard, along with Reno and two other young black men, drinking, driving and serenading ladies out of and in Jefferson.  Mitch sings ""Goodnight, Ladies"" in a ""true, oversweet tenor"" voice (143).  He is a ""freight agent"" (140), and may be the same character as Mitch Ewing in ""Hair.""</p>","Yes"
"21511","1493","Mrs. Marders","Marders, Mrs.","","<p>A gossipy friend of Belle Mitchell's in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.   It is she who tells Narcissa that her brother and Belle are having an affair.  The narrator tells us that ""her eyes were like the eyes of an old turkey, predatory and unwinking; a little obscene"" (184).</p>","Yes"
"21510","1492","Mandy 1","Mandy 1","","<p>Mandy is the only woman who lives at the MacCallum place in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  She cooks for the white family, although the narrator describes Henry MacCallum as ""a better cook now than Mandy"" (335).  Her size and shape are indicated by the narrator's description of the way her ""homely calico expanse"" fills the doorway between the house and the kitchen (336).</p>","Yes"
"21509","1491","Dr Jones","Jones, Dr","","<p>""Dr"" (as Faulkner wrote it, without the period) is a nickname.  ""Dr Jones"" is the bank's janitor, about as old as Bayard (whom he calls ""General""), and described only as ""black and stooped with querulousness and age"" (105).</p>","Yes"
"21508","1490","John Henry","John Henry","Pappy","<p>Pappy's son, the ""younger"" of the two Negroes who help Young Bayard after his car goes off the bridge in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>; he treats Bayard's broken body with great gentleness.</p>","Yes"
"21507","1489","Unnamed Wife of Hub","Unnamed Wife of Hub","","<p>She stands in the doorway of her small farm house and watches Hub, Suratt and Young Bayard as they leave to go to town in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  There is apparently reproach in her look, but in her ""flat country voice,"" she speaks only one word, ""Hub"" (138).</p>","Yes"
"21506","1488","Hub","Hub","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Hub is the young farmer who provides the illegal moonshine that fuels the road trip Young Bayard takes to Oxford.  He is married, and has a sister or a daughter named Sue, but his character seems summed up when he tells Suratt that he ""dont give a damn"" if anyone tells where the whiskey came from (138).  He is clearly a different character from any of the ""Hub Hampton""s who are county sheriffs.</p>","Yes"
"21505","1487","Joan Heppleton","Heppleton, Joan","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Joan is Belle Mitchell's younger sister who comes to Jefferson while Belle is away getting a divorce, to see what Horace Benbow is like; during the week she spends in town she and Horace have an affair.  By the time she gets to Jefferson she has had a wide experience, both of the world (having lived in Hawaii, Australia and India, among other unnamed ""random points half the world apart,"" 322) and of men (having been married a least twice and lived with at least one other man).  There is ""an indefinable something in her air, her carriage"" that causes people in both Jefferson and her home town to stare (316).  Horace associates it with big cats, like the tiger he once saw in a circus.  Faulkner may expect contemporary readers to associate it with the ""new woman"" of the Twenties.  (Her character was edited out of the novel when it was originally published as <em>Sartoris</em> in 1929.)</p>","Yes"
"21504","1486","Unc Henry","Unc Henry","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> he is one of the blacks who sharecrops on the Sartoris estate; he does not appear in the novel, but the possum hunt that Bayard and Narcissa go on with Caspey and Isom begins behind his cabin.</p>","Yes"
"21503","1485","Meloney Harris","Meloney Harris","","<p>First described by the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> as a ""young light negress"" (27), Meloney is later referred to by Jenny Du Pre as a ""mulatto girl"" (394).  She is Belle Mitchell's servant when the novel begins, but soon goes into business for herself as a beautician with the money that Simon embezzles from the Second Baptist Church. At the end of the novel Simon is found murdered in her cabin.</p>","Yes"
"21502","1484","Mr. Gratton","Gratton, Mr.","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Gratton is a short-tempered veteran of World War I, introduced by Eustace Graham as a man who was ""up on the British front last spring"" (125).

He and the Colonel are horse racing when Sartoris surprises and captures the company of Yankee cavalry.</p>","Yes"
"21499","1481","Will Falls","Will Falls","","<p><em>Flags in the Dust</em> begins with ""old man Falls"" (3).  During the Civil War, Will Falls served with Colonel John Sartoris' irregular outfit.  The stories he tells Old Bayard about that past serve to fetch ""the spirit of the dead man"" into the novel's post World War I present (3), and the old Choctaw salve with which he successfully treats Bayard's wen reinforces the role he plays as a connection to the old South.  He lives frugally in the county poor farm, regularly walks the three miles into town, and his ""faded overalls"" give off a ""clean dusty smell"" (3).</p>","Yes"
"21498","1480","Eunice 1","Eunice 1","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Eunice is the Benbows' cook. She expresses a sort of maternal concern about Horace's welfare.  Narcissa tells her that ""Nobody can make chocolate pies like yours"" (309).</p>","Yes"
"21497","1479","James Vardaman","Vardaman, James","","<p>""Vardaman"" is mentioned twice in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, once by Aunt Jenny and once by Deacon Rogers (62, 122).  Both of them express admiration for his character and politics.  Known as ""The Great White Chief,"" James K. Vardaman served one term as Governor of Mississippi (1904-1908) and one term in the United States Senate (1913-1919).  A militant segregationist, he vowed to lynch every African American in the state if that ever became necessary.  He opposed U.S. involvement in the First World War, and (as Aunt Jenny notes) argued against using ""colored"" troops in any way in the Army.  Three 'poor white' characters in the fictions are named after him: Vardaman Gowrie in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, Vardaman Snopes in <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>, and Vardaman Bundren in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, the best known of the three.</p>","No"

He is supposed to live in St. Louis.</p>","No"
"21493","1475","Dr. Brandt","Dr. Brandt","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Doctor Brandt is the Memphis medical specialist to whom Dr. Alford refers Old Bayard.

"21491","1473","Allan","Allan","","<p>According to Aunt Jenny's story in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Allan is the Confederate officer who reminds General J.E.B. Stuart of his duty to the army in order to keep him from following Carolina Bayard on his reckless quest for anchovies.</p>","No"
"21490","1472","Abe","Abe","","<p>At the Sartoris Thanksgiving dinner in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Dr. Peabody mentions Abe as one of the gillies who help the gentlemen who come to fish his pond.  (""Gilly"" is a Scottish term for a servant who assists a fisherman.)  When asked ""how many [other black retainers] have you got,"" Peabody says ""six or seven"" adults, and an unspecified number of ""scrubs"" (i.e. children), but they are not named (303).</p>","Yes"
"21489","1471","Professor Wilkins","Wilkins, Professor","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Professor Wilkins is teaching and boarding Bayard Sartoris while Bayard pursues a law degree. He seems to have grown fond of Bayard and calls him ""my son"" when he has to deliver the sad news about Bayard's father's murder (212).  Professor and student have had conversations about the principles of the Bible and the Ten Commandments, particularly ""Thou shalt not kill."" He is afraid that Bayard is contemplating breaking it as he ""believed he was touching [Bayard's] flesh which might not be alive tomorrow"" (216).  Bayard refers to him as ""Judge Wilkins"" (212).</p>","No"
"21488","1470","Mrs. Wilkins","Wilkins, Mrs.","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Mrs. Wilkins and her husband give Bayard a home while he is pursuing a law degree in Oxford, Mississippi. She is a ""small"" woman whose little gestures (""she just put her hands on my shoulders"") reveal her big compassion for Bayard (215).</p>","No"
"21487","1469","Jed White","White, Jed","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Jed White is a Civil War veteran, a member of Colonel Sartoris' troop who declares his willingness to serve the new Sartoris - Bayard - in a quest to restore his family's honor after the Colonel's murder.</p>","Yes"
"21486","1468","Unnamed Writers","Unnamed Writers","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Bayard evokes ""the men who have written"" of the kind of woman he identifies Drusilla with at this point in the story: the ""woman of thirty"" (228). Although no writers are named, Balzac was one of Faulkner's favorite writers, and he may be be thinking of the character Julie in Honoré de Balzac's 1842 novel <em>La femme de trente ans</em> (<em>A Woman of Thirty</em>).</p>","No"
"21485","1467","Unnamed Women in Jefferson 2","Unnamed Women in Jefferson 2","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em>, when Bayard first rides into town on his way to confront Redmond, these ""women"" are the only people he sees on the street, he assumes because it was ""long past breakfast and not yet noon"" (245). These women recognize Bayard and ""stopped sudden and dead"" when they realize his potentially fatal errand (245).</p>","Yes"
"21484","1466","Unnamed Watchman","Unnamed Watchman","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Bayard assumes this ""watchman"" or ""picquet"" must have been watching to report his arrival at Sartoris to the other veterans of ""Father's old troop"" (232); he does not actually appear in the novel.</p>","Yes"
"21483","1465","Unnamed Union Trainmen","Unnamed Union Trainmen","","<p>In an event added to ""Raid"" in the novel <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Drusilla Hawk recounts a dramatic contest, ""like a meeting between two iron knights of the old time,"" between two trains, one manned by Confederates and the other in pursuit, manned by these Union forces (98).  Drusilla labels the train itself ""the Yankee one,"" does not describe the men who are driving it (96).</p>","No"
"21481","1464","Unnamed Third Partner in Railroad","Unnamed Third Partner in Railroad","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> just enough is said about the third partner in the railroad owned by John Sartoris and Ben Redmond to make him mysterious: ""he and his name both had vanished,"" Bayard says, ""in the fury of the conflict"" between the other two partners (224).</p>","Yes"
"21479","1463","Son of Professor and Mrs. Wilkins","Wilkins, Son of Professor and Mrs. Wilkins","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> the son of Professor and Mrs. Wilkins' was killed in ""almost the last battle"" of the Civil War, which would have been sometime in 1865 (214). When he died, he was about the same age as Bayard is in ""An Odor of Verbena.""</p>","No"
"21478","1462","Unnamed Slaves of McCaslins 1","Unnamed Slaves of McCaslins 1","","<p>In a passage Faulkner added to ""Retreat"" when the story was published as a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Bayard describes the unconventional way Buck and Buddy treat the large number of enslaved people they inherited from their father. The two white slave-owners move out of the ""big colonial house which their father had built"" (46), and use it instead to house the slaves; as long as they do so surreptitiously, these slaves are allowed to leave every night. And the white men ""had some kind of a system of book-keeping"" by which the slaves were given credit for their labor, so that they could in time ""earn"" their freedom by their ""work on the plantation"" (48). The narrative suggests the slaves respect these arrangements, although none of them appears in the story as a character.  (See also Unnamed Slaves of McCaslins 2.)</p>","Yes"
"21477","1461","Unnamed Railroad Workmen","Unnamed Railroad Workmen","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Bayard twice mentions the ""workmen"" (225) who build Colonel Sartoris' railroad line to Jefferson. He pays them on ""Saturdays"" (220).</p>","Yes"

"21474","1459","Unnamed Union Quartermaster","Unnamed Union Quartermaster","","<p>In ""The Unvanquished"" and again in the chapter titled ""Riposte in Tertio"" in <em>The Unvanquished</em> the Yankee lieutenant whose men have damaged the mule pen fence while re-possessing the livestock Rosa stole gives her a voucher worth $10 drawn ""on the quartermaster at Memphis"" (91, 145).  A military quartermaster is in charge of providing supplies to the forces.</p>","No"
"21473","1458","Unnamed Patroller","Unnamed Patroller","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Bayard describes ""the Patroller (sitting in one of the straight hard chairs and smoking one of Father's cigars too but with his hat off)"" having caught some of the Satoris slaves away from the plantation (16).  In the antebellum South patrollers watched at night to capture any slaves who were out of their quarters without authorization from their owners, and pursued fugitive slaves.</p>","Yes"
"21472","1457","Unnamed Band Members 3","Unnamed Band Members 3","","<p>This is the ""band"" that plays in <em>The Unvanquished</em> when Colonel Sartoris drives the first train on the newly finished track into Jefferson (226).</p>","Yes"
"21471","1456","Unnamed Men at Holston House","Unnamed Men at Holston House","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> these men are originally depicted  as the ""row of feet"" that Bayard sees propped on the porch railing when he arrives at Holston House to confront Redmond (245).  Afterward, when Bayard leaves the hotel, this same group ""raises their hats"" out of respect for him (251).</p>","Yes"
"21470","1455","Unnamed Spectators at Train Race","Unnamed Spectators at Train Race","","<p>These are the various ""watchers - the black and the white, the old men, the children, the women who would not know for months yet if they were widows or childless or not"" (96) - who assemble near Hawkhurst to witness the contest between a Confederate and a Union locomotive described by Drusilla Hawk.  Drusilla implies that many of these spectators were part of a ""grapevine"" of oppressed and deprived people who knew of the raid before it happened (97). Drusilla's story is based on the actual Andrews Raid, which took place on April 12, 1862, but her version takes several liberties with the facts of the historical incident.</p>","No"
"21469","1454","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 11","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 11","","<p>In ""Retreat"" as both a story and as a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, these townspeople ""stop along the walk, like they always did,"" to listen to Uncle Buck shouting his praise for Colonel Sartoris (21, 51).  In the novel version, Faulkner adds a phrase that may signal a change in the way we are meant to regard Buck: ""not smiling so he could see it"" (51).  And in the novel, the people in Jefferson appear again in ""An Odor of Verbena"" to watch as Bayard makes his way to Redmond's office, following him with their ""remote still eyes"" (247).  When Redmond appears, ""they began to run"" to get closer (249).</p>","Yes"
"21467","1453","Unnamed People on the Road to Memphis","Unnamed People on the Road to Memphis","","<p>In ""Retreat"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em> these are the people who live in the various ""houses on the road"" to Memphis; ""at least once a day"" Granny, Bayard and Ringo stop to eat with them (23, 55).</p>","No"
"21466","1452","Unnamed Widow of Hill Man","Unnamed Widow of Hill Man","Unnamed Widow of Hill Man, Unnamed Hill Man 2","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> this woman - even though she is dirt poor (literally, as she lives in a ""dirt-floored cabin in the hills"") - maintains her pride by throwing back the money John Sartoris offers her after he shot her husband (221).</p>","Yes"
"21465","1451","Unnamed Hill Man 2","Unnamed Hill Man 2","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> this man lives with his family in a ""dirt-floored cabin in the hills"" outside Jefferson (221).  He served under John Sartoris in his first regiment.  After the war Sartoris shoots and kills him, because he thinks (perhaps wrongly) that the man plans to rob him.</p>","Yes"
"21464","1450","Unnamed Children of Hill Man","Unnamed Children of Hill Man","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> these are the children of the ""hill man"" whom Colonel Sartoris shoots after the War; they live with their mother in ""a dirt-floored cabin in the hills"" (221).</p>","Yes"
"21463","1449","Unnamed English Blockade Runner","Unnamed English Blockade Runner","","<p>Aunt Jenny tells Bayard about this ""Englishman"" among the blockade runners she knew in Charleston during the Civil War: ""He must have been a gentleman once or associated with gentlemen"" (244).  For most of the Civil War the Union Navy blockaded the ports of the Confederate states, including Charleston, South Carolina.  ""Blockade runners"" were sailors who snuck their ships past the Union ships to bring supplies to the South.  This unnamed English seaman was presumably an officer.  His smuggling, although motivated by money, made him a hero to Aunt Jenny and her peers. Although Jenny never mentions the name she knew him by, she tells Bayard that ""he changed his name"" and he liked rum (244).</p>","No"
"21462","1448","Unnamed Dirt Farmers","Unnamed Dirt Farmers","","<p>In a passage added to the ""Retreat"" chapter of <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Bayard describes these poor whites as ""the people whom the niggers called 'white trash'"" - though he himself refers to them several times as ""white trash"" too (48-49).  Their low status is defined in part by the fact that they ""owned no slaves"" (49).  They farm ""little patches of poor hill land"" near the McCaslin place and in some cases ""live worse than the slaves on the big plantation"" (49).  According to Bayard, they ""look on Uncle Buck and Buddy like Deity Himself"" (49).  Some of them join Colonel John's first regiment and are responsible for his demotion.</p>","Yes"
"21461","1447","Unnamed Countrymen 1","Unnamed Countrymen 1","","<p>These ""countrymen"" - inhabitants of the countryside around Jefferson rather than town residents - don't appear directly in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, but they have left mark on the ""wooden steps scuffed by the heavy bewildered boots"" when they come into town to consult Ben Redmond in his law office (248); the fact that they are ""bewildered"" suggests their class status, and seems also intended to say something about Redmond's practice.</p>","Yes"
"21460","1446","Unnamed Confederate Trainmen","Unnamed Confederate Trainmen","","<p>In a passage added to ""Raid"" as a chapter of <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Drusilla tells Ringo about the race between two railroad trains, one driven by Confederates and the other by Union forces, who rushed past Hawkhurst before the track was destroyed by Yankee troops. Her story may have been inspired by an actual event - the Andrews Raid, which took place between Atlanta and Chattanooga on April 12, 1862 -  but her version reverses the order of the ""chase"": in the actual raid, Union forces in Confederate-held Atlanta stole a locomotive and were then pursued by by Confederates in another locomotive. Drusilla's story does not specify who the Confederate participants were, but it is implied that the raid was a way for the ""gray generals"" to show people in the South ""a glimpse of that for which you have suffered and been denied"" (97).</p>","No"
"21459","1445","Unnamed Charlestonians","Unnamed Charlestonians","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> this is the group that Aunt Jenny refers to ""us"" and ""we"": her fellow Charlestonians during the War who, like herself, admired the efforts of the English blockade runner to break through the Union naval blockade, and so helped alleviate their sufferings during under the constrained wartime conditions, the time when ""we had all forgot what money was, what you could do with it"" (244).</p>","No"
"21457","1444","Unnamed Union Auditor","Unnamed Union Auditor","","<p>In ""The Unvanquished"" and then in the chapter titled ""Riposte in Tertio"" in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, this auditor is mentioned by the Union lieutenant whose men take down a mule pen fence while re-taking stolen Union livestock. The lieutenant gives Rosa a voucher worth $10 to pay for the damaged fence, then asks her not to forge a higher amount because, as he says, ""if in about four months the auditor should find a warrant in the records for a thousand dollars to Mrs Rosa Millard, I would have to make it good"" (91, 147).</p>","No"
"21456","1443","General John Hunt Morgan","Morgan, General John Hunt","","<p>John Hunt Morgan commanded a cavalry regiment in the western theater of the Civil War, and, like Nathan Bedford Forrest, was known for his raids behind Yankee lines. His 1863 raid into southern Indiana and Ohio was the furthest Confederate penetration of the North. In <em>The Unvanquished</em>, among ""the names"" that Bayard and Ringo hear John Sartoris mention as he talks about the war is ""Morgan"" (15). The reference in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> to ""Morgan leading a cavalry charge against a stranded man-of-war"" presumably refers to his burning of the Ohio River steamboat Alice Dean in Brandenburg, Kentucky (274). ""Morgan"" is also mentioned in ""Shall Not Perish"" as one of the names that the narrator's great-grandfather, a Confederate veteran, would holler while dozing ""in his chair under the mulberry in the yard or on the sunny end of the front gallery or in his corner by the hearth"" (112).</p>","No"
"21454","1442","Unc Few Mitchell","Mitchell, Unc Few","","<p>In ""Retreat"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Louvinia mentions ""Unc Few Mitchell"" to help Bayard and Ringo appreciate the performance Colonel Sartoris puts on for the Union troops who had ridden up to the plantation in search of him.  According to her, he was ""born loony"" (34, 73).  From the way she talks about him, it seems very likely that he is another enslaved person on the Sartoris plantation, but that is not explicitly said.</p>","Yes"
"21453","1441","Missy Lena","Missy Lena","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> - in a passage added to the original story ""Raid"" - Ringo sleeps in ""Missy Lena's cabin"" at Hawkhurst; she is undoubtedly a slave on the plantation, but does not appear in the novel herself (99). If her name was given her by the whites who owned her, as was probably the case, Missy Lena is likely a corruption of ""Messalina,"" the wife of the Roman emperor Claudius; in Faulkner's fiction as in southern history, slave names were often a mock-heroic version of classical ones.</p>","No"
"21451","1440","Hilliard","Hilliard","","<p>The ""Hilliard at the livery stable"" in <em>The Unvanquished</em> Oxford is presumably the owner who lets Ringo talk him out of a good horse for his long ride (217).</p>","No"
"21450","1439","Mr. Habersham","Habersham, Mr.","","<p>In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Mr. Habersham works in a ""little dim hole"" in a bank (220).  He obeys his wife's command and signs John Sartoris' peace bond.  (The Habersham family figures in Faulkner's fiction among the founders of Yoknapatawpha, but the married couple in this novel are not specifically associated with that larger narrative.)</p>","Yes"
"21449","1438","John Sevier","Sevier, John","","<p>The John Sevier mentioned by Aunt Jenny in <em>The Unvanquished</em> was a frontiersmen whose adventures made him a hero ""to small boys or fool young women"" (244).</p>","No"
"21448","1437","David Crockett","Crockett, David","","<p>The ""David Crockett"" whom Aunt Jenny mentions in <em>The Unvanquished</em> is much better known as Davy (244). He was a frontiersman, U.S. Congressman and soldier. His death among the Americans at the Alamo in 1836 ensured him a spot in the annals of American lore.</p>","No"
"21447","1436","General William Barksdale","Barksdale, General William","","<p>The historical figure William Barksdale, mentioned in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, was born in Tennessee but was serving as Congressman  from Mississippi at the start of the Civil War.  He resigned that office to fight for the Confederacy. He participated in many battles in Virginia and was mortally wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863.</p>","No"
"21446","1435","Unnamed Borneo Headhunters","Unnamed Borneo Headhunters","","<p>This anomalous 'character' does not appear in either the magazine or book versions of ""Vendee.""  But in the typescript for the story Faulkner included a passing reference to the techniques used by ""headhunters"" in Borneo that Bayard read about and that he and Ringo apparently employ in skinning Grumby after they succeed in killing him (115).  In his edition of the story for <em>Uncollected Stories</em>, Joseph Blotner restores this passage to the text, and so the ""headhunters"" become an entry in our database.</p>","No"
"21445","1434","Tennant","Tennant","","<p>All we know about this Confederate brigade commander mentioned in <em>The Unvanquished</em> is that when John Sartoris returns to Mississippi after being demoted by his troops, ""Uncle Buddy"" McCaslin apparently stays behind as a sergeant ""in Tennant's brigade in Virginia"" (51).</p>","No"
"21442","1433","Unnamed Union Officer 1","Unnamed Union Officer 1","","<p>The commander of the Union troop that comes to Sartoris hoping to capture Colonel John Sartoris appears first in Will Falls' account of the event in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, and then again in Louvinia's slightly different account of the same event in both ""Retreat"" and <em>The Unvanquished</em>.</p>","Yes"
"21439","1432","Unnamed Parchman Chain Gang","Unnamed Parchman Chain Gang","","<p>The specific chain gang that Mink works on while at Parchman's in <em>The Mansion</em> consists of eleven men altogether, who go to and from the ""mess hall to eat"" and the cotton field where they are forced to work ""shackled to the same chain"" (105).  The three who are named - Mink himself, Stillwell and Barron - are all white, and they live inside the penitentiary in ""a detached wire-and-canvas-and-plank hut,"" so it seems safe to assume that in the segregrated South, all eleven are white, but that is an assumption. The gang tries to kill Mink after he objects to their plan to escape.</p>","No"
"21437","1430","Unnamed Negro Inmates 4","Unnamed Negro Inmates 4","","<p>The five other black men in the county jail where Lucas is held in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> are described by the narrative as the ""crap-shooters and whiskey-peddlers and razor-throwers"" who are kept in a single large room on the second floor (30).  Some of these Negro prisoners are assigned to what the narrative calls the ""street gang"" that works outside the jail maintaining town property (54).  Under ordinary circumstances, the narrator says twice, the barred window of the second-floor cell would be ""thick with dark hands"" as the prisoners interact with friends and family on the outside (38, 50), but like Yoknapatawpha's black population in general, once Lucas is arrested even these hands disappear.</p>","Yes"
"21436","1429","Unnamed Negro Inmates 2","Unnamed Negro Inmates 2","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> the black prisoners in the Jefferson jail that holds Mink Snopes are described as ""the negro victims of a thousand petty white man's misdemeanors""  (285).  At night they ""eat and sleep together"" in the jail's ""common room""; during the day they work outside on a chain gang, once a familiar feature of the southern penal system.  They are described from Mink's point of view, as ""a disorderly clump of heads in battered hats and caps and bodies in battered overalls and broken shoes"" (285).</p>","Yes"
"21435","1428","Unnamed Railroad Brakeman 2","Unnamed Railroad Brakeman 2","","<p>This is the train brakeman in ""Monk"" who sees an accomplice help Bill Terrel carry a body through the bushes and ""fling it under the train"" (59). Although he's clearly observant, the brakeman could not tell if the victim was dead or alive at the time.</p>","No"
"21434","1427","Unnamed Enslaved Males","Unnamed Enslaved Males","","<p>In ""Wash"" these enslaved black men laugh at Wash for remaining in Yoknapatawpha during the Civil War. They would make fun of him with the question ""Why ain't you at de war, white man?"" (537).  ""Most"" of Sutpen's slaves leave to follow the Union army toward freedom after ""Sherman passes through the plantation"" (537).</p>","Yes"
"21432","1426","Unnamed Union Soldier 3","Unnamed Union Soldier 3","","<p>This is the unnamed Union soldier who annoys his superior officer by laughing at Ringo's evasion of the Union lieutenant's questioning in both ""The Unvanquished"" and again in the chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em> titled ""Riposte in Tertio.""</p>","No"
"21431","1280","Unnamed Union General 1","Unnamed Union General 1","","<p>Two of <em>The Unvanquished</em> stories refer to but don't name a Union general in command of the forces in the area of Yoknapatawpha.  In ""Ambuscade"" this general is mentioned by Sergeant Harrison, who heard ""the general"" in command of the larger unit to which his cavalry troop belongs say that ""if he had enough horses, he wouldn’t always care whether there was anybody to ride them or not"" (13, 30).   In ""Raid,"" where the troops are identified as the ""-th Army Corps, Department of Tennessee"" (54, 112), it is this general's signature the requisition form that results in Rosa Millard going back to Mississippi with a lot more silver, mules and Negroes than she expected.  Historically, as Faulkner might have expected his readers to know, the Army of Tennessee was commanded first by Ulysses S. Grant and then (after the fall of Vicksburg) by William T. Sherman.  Grant is mentioned several times in these texts.  Sherman's name appears in ""Raid"" (45), and he was the leader associated with the kind of ""total war"" that would account for all the burned plantations along Rosa's route, although he did not wage that kind of campaign until after leaving Mississippi.  Faulkner could have been thinking of either one of these generals as this unnamed general - or of no particular general at all.</p>","Yes"
"21429","1425","General James Wilkinson","Wilkinson, General James","","<p>This historical personage James Wilkinson, mentioned in both ""Red Leaves"" and ""Appendix Compson,"" was a very controversial figure - while he fought for the young American nation as a General between 1796 and 1812, he was also secretly a paid agent of the Spanish crown.  In ""Red Leaves,"" ""General Wilkinson"" appears as an ""intimate"" friend of De Vitry in New Orleans (318); historically, he lived in that city at several different times between 1787 and 1807.  In ""Appendix Compson,"" he is an acquaintance of Charles Stuart Compson.</p>","No"
"21428","1424","Unnamed Slaves of Indians 3","Unnamed Slaves of Indians 3","","<p>When Issetibbeha takes over the tribe in ""Red Leaves"" he puts the ""young Negroes"" in the cabins to ""mate"" (320) and produce children whom he can sell.</p>","Yes"
"21427","1423","Unnamed Unitarian Trader","Unnamed Unitarian Trader","","<p>This ""trader"" may be the American who buys the protagonist of ""Red Leaves"" after he reaches America, though that isn't specifically said (330).  The narrative identifies him as ""a deacon in the Unitarian church"" (330).  Historically there were no deacons in the Unitarian church.  The religion was specifically associated with New England in the antebellum period, so by identifying the slave trader as a Unitarian, the narrative reinforces the association of American slavery with the North it already established by identifying the captain of the slave ship that brought the protagonist to the U.S. a ""New England captain"" (330).</p>","No"
"21426","1422","Unnamed Indian Stripling","Unnamed Indian Stripling","","<p>In ""Red Leaves"" this stripling attends to Moketubbe on his litter; his pert manner of speaking annoys the older men Three Basket and Louis Berry.</p>","Yes"
"21425","1421","Unnamed Slave Trader","Unnamed Slave Trader","","<p>In ""Red Leaves,"" Issetibbeha sells forty slaves to ""a Memphis trader"" to get money to go to Europe (320).  It's not clear if this trader travels to Yoknapatawpha or if Issetibbeha travels to Memphis.</p>","Yes"

In his later fictions Faulkner identifies the Indians who live in Yoknapatawpha first as ""Choctaw,"" then as ""Chickasaw.""  Historically, they were part of the Chickasaw nation, but Faulkner's Indians are not particularly historical.  For example, in this story they are associated several times with cannibalism (314, 319).  Their customs include burying a chief's dog, horse and personal slave along with the chief, though the story also several times references the time before they owned any slaves, and they blame the newly arrived white settlers for introducing slavery to them.  By the time ""Red Leaves"" takes place, they have had many interactions with the white world.  Their regular outfits include European accessories like the ""enameled snuffbox"" that Three Basket wears as an earring (313), and they attend the chief's funeral in ""their stiff European finery"" (331).

The slaves who worked on his huge plantation before the Civil War appear, though tangentially, in ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard"" and again in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  None of them are given an individual identity, but the short story does say that they ""raised cotton"" before the War and ""buried"" the Frenchman's gold to hide it from Yankees during the War, and they would also have provided the labor for the Frenchman to ""straighten the river bed"" to reclaim the land for producing cotton (136).  Apparently some of them are buried in the Frenchman's graveyard, though none of their descendants remain in Frenchman's Bend.  When this information is repeated in the novel, it adds two details: the part of the river bed they straightened was ""almost ten miles"" long (4), and at least some of them <em>are</em> buried ""beneath the weathered and illegible headstones"" in a cemetery that sits on ""a knoll four hundred yards away"" from the plantation's big house (375).</p>","Yes"

They are described as “in their own hats and hunting coats and overalls which any town negro would have thrown away or burned and only the rubber boots strong and sound, and the worn and blueless guns and some even without guns” (224).</p>","Yes"
"21379","1375","Unnamed Negro Cook 3","Unnamed Negro Cook 3","","<p>The second of the Negroes whom Hightower hires to cook for him is a man.  Although there are white households with only one servant in the fictions, where the servant is a male, this is the only instance in the fictions when a male servant is specifically identified as a domestic cook.  It is the result of an exceptional circumstance.  After Hightower's wife commits suicide,  ""masked men"" scare off the light-skinned Negro woman who cooks for him (71).  Hightower hires a male hoping to prevent the town from spreading false rumors, but this cook quits after ""some men, not masked either,"" take him out and whip him (72).

"21370","1367","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 14","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 14","","<p>The various townspeople whom Pap and his son encounter during their brief visit to Jefferson in ""Fool about a Horse"" will probably remember the pair vividly.  A group of pedestrians on the street has to ""scatter"" when the runaway mules come ""swurging"" into town (128), and another group in the alley behind the hardware store is treated to the sight of those same two mules apparently trying to hang themselves by their reins, like people ""in one of these here suicide packs"" (129).

It's not clear how many of the men in this mob are residents of Jefferson, rather than country people who've driven into town.  At one point, however, the narrator describes the newer residents of Jefferson as a group.  They are ""prosperous young married couples"" with ""two children each"" and ""an automobile"" and ""memberships in the country club and the bridge clubs and the junior rotary"" (118).  They live in ""houses designed in Florida and California"" that come with ""patented electric gadgets for cooking and freezing and cleaning"" (118).

"21362","1360","Unnamed Hardwick Jailer","Unnamed Hardwick Jailer","","<p>Although he is not specifically mentioned in <em>The Reivers</em>, the ""jailor"" in the county sheriff's office in Hardwick can be inferred from the number of times the cells are locked and unlocked while Boon is there (270).

(According to the ""Corrected Texts"" that Noel Polk edited for Vintage International, Faulkner spelled ""jailer"" with an 'e' in ""That Evening Sun,"" <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, ""An Error in Chemistry"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> but with an 'o' in ""Monk"" and <em>The Reivers</em>.

When Ike learns that the young woman is descended from James Beauchamp, he might have realized that this cousin of hers is also a relative of <em>his</em> - part of the extended McCaslin-Beauchamp-Edmonds family - but that is not made explicit in the chapter.  (The same ""Negro man"" appears in the magazine version of ""Delta Autumn"" - described and discussed identically, except for the capitalization of the ""N"" in ""Negro"" - but we have a separate entry for him, because he is not part of the McCaslin-Beauchamp-Edmonds family.)</p>","No"

There were in historical fact almost 180,000 'Colored troops' during the Civil War, serving in both non-combat and combat roles, but until recently these men were largely invisible in American representations of that war.

This 'other man' may be Dalton Ames, who is not mentioned in the ""Appendix"" but is Caddy's first sexual partner in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (1929).

Though they never speak, they are presumably state employees.  They both carry guns, and have new, crisp haircuts.  It is not clear how they managed to be waiting outside the cemetery to ""come on"" Darl after Addie is buried, though when Cash mentions Gillespie in his account of Darl's apprehension it seems likely that it was the man whose barn Darl burned who arranged to have them there (237).</p>","Yes"

Vernon thinks of her in reference to the hard lot women have in life: she ""lived to be seventy and more"" having worked everyday of her life and never having been sick (30).

""Them,"" ""they"" - these are the only terms that that Anse uses to describe the people who come to his house and use ""the law"" to ""talk me out of"" Darl (37, 36).  The most likely explanation of this event is the Selective Service Act of 1917, which required men between the ages of 21 and 31 to register for the draft (in 1918, it was expanded to include men between 18 and 21).  That would mean Darl has been drafted and ""they"" are agents of the federal government.  Anse seems to assume that ""their"" reason for taking Darl has something to do with his strangeness, and if that is true then ""they"" may instead be agents of state's the mental health system (like the two men who take Darl away at the end of the novel).  But the novel nowhere suggests Darl has been institutionalized before his mother's death, and it does say he served in France ""at the war"" (254).

We learn from several sources that Addie's ""people"" lived in Jefferson (171), though we are not given any idea where or what their family name was.  We are also told that by the time she meets Anse Bundren, all Addie's family are now buried ""in the cemetery"" in town (171).  Her father is the one member of this family who is individuated, though he exists in the novel only as a voice that she remembers saying ""that the reason for living is getting ready to stay dead"" a long time (175).  Unlike the loquacious Mr. Compson in Quentin's section of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, this is all that Addie's ""father said"" (175) - but as in that earlier novel, as a voice that echoes in the consciousness of his child, this father plays a huge role in the story.</p>","Yes"

"21322","690","Lafe","Lafe","","<p><em>As I Lay Dying</em> provides very little information about Lafe, the father of Dewey Dell’s unborn baby. We do know that the day they had sex he was picking cotton in the fields with Dewey Dell, but whether he is a farmhand or simply working there because of his attraction to her isn't clear. Given the Bundrens' lack of money, however, the latter seems more likely.  He gave Dewey Dell the $10 bill she carries to town to pay for an abortion.  His name at least is very meaningful to her - ""Lafe. Lafe. 'Lafe.' Lafe. Lafe."" (62) - but it's not clear how much she means to him.</p>","Yes"

He narrates ten chapters in which we follow the progression of a child's grieving process after the death of a parent. He also reveals poignant and specific examples of the poverty in which he resides. He is described by the other narrators as very small.  (Vardaman is named after James K.

While the Bundren family has always had mules, he worked hard to acquire a horse, which he rides with pride and skill.  Throughout the narrative he is quietly, though violently, angry.

He is compulsive about his tools, and his narration shows him to be single–minded as he tends to frame everything in the terms of his craft.  But he also likes music, and brings eight dollars on the trip to town in the hopes of buying a ""graphophone"" (i.e. a portable record player, 258).</p>","Yes"

At the end of the story, when Sarty bursts into the mansion to warn Major de Spain, this house servant is the first person that he encounters.

When Ab commands his wife to restrain Sarty to prevent him from warning De Spain, Lizzie sides against Ab, telling Lennie: ""Let him go! . . . If he don't go, before God, I am going up there [to De Spain's] myself"" (22).

Emily's father and her other ""kin in Alabama"" have a falling out ""over the estate of old lady Wyatt"" after she dies (125).

"21297","482","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 2","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 2","","<p>One of the narrative devices that Faulkner regularly deploys is using the larger population of Jefferson as a kind of chorus to provide commentary on the characters or events of a specific story.  In each case it seems fair to say that the ""townspeople"" he uses this way are implicitly the <em>white</em> people, but it seems more accurate to create a separate ""Character=Jefferson Townspeople"" for each text in which the device occurs.  ""A Rose for Emily"" brings the townspeople as a collection onstage in the story's very first sentence, where the narrator refers to ""our whole town"" (119).  Most frequently the story uses the first-person plural for them, ""we"" rather than 'they.' The descriptions of their actions and opinions suggests a homogeneous group. They are fond of gossip and quick to make moral judgments.  Given the way they enjoy the discomfiture of the haughty Griersons, they seem mainly middle class.</p>","Yes"

We hear nothing else about these women or this edict, whether they complied or it was enforced or when it might have been rescinded.  The ""apron"" would have typified, not to say stereo-typified, all black women as domestic servants.  Throughout the Yoknapatawpha fictions many if not most of the 'Negro women' characters occupy that place in the social system, but the mayor's sumptuary rule seeks to put an entire population in that place.</p>","Yes"

"21290","412","Unnamed Mayor 1","Unnamed Mayor 1","","<p>One of the three town mayors in ""A Rose for Emily,"" and the only one without a name, this man takes office in the early 20th century, and seems much less chivalrous than his 19th-century predecessor, Colonel Sartoris, who treats Emily as a lady who should not be bothered about financial matters .

"21289","405","Unnamed Little Boys","Unnamed Little Boys","","<p>Mentioned only once in ""A Rose for Emily,"" the groups of ""little boys"" who follow Homer and his gang of construction workers as they pave the town's sidewalks are equally fascinated by the white man's profanity and the black men's singing (124).</p>","Yes"
"21288","404","Unnamed Jeweler 2","Unnamed Jeweler 2","","<p>The town jeweler in ""A Rose for Emily"" sells Emily Grierson a man's ""toilet set in silver"" - usually a comb and a brush, with perhaps a mirror and a clothes brush - engraved with the initials ""H.B."" (127).</p>","Yes"

Their unnamed spokesman is polite but firm, though his courteousness is soundly defeated by her intransigence - and the unwritten chivalric rules that still govern relations between men and ladies.</p>","Yes"

This is the group of aldermen who visit the house in the middle of the night around 1881, because the smell emanating from her house has become a public nuisance.

When he and Emily Grierson begin appearing in public together in ""the yellow-wheeled buggy . . . from the livery stable,"" the town is soon scandalized that ""a Grierson"" woman might think ""seriously of a Northerner, a day laborer"" (124).  Homer tells the ""younger men in the Elks' Club . . . that he is not a marrying man,"" which has led a few modern commentators to suggest that he may be gay (126).  Perhaps the more likely reading, however, is simply that he doesn't want to be tied down to any one woman.</p>","Yes"
"21277","317","Mr. Grierson","Grierson, Mr.","","<p>In ""A Rose for Emily,"" Mr. Grierson has been dead for some time when he is first referred to in the story. Alive he was an old-fashioned, over-bearing patriarch who did not allow his daughter to mingle with any men, keeping all possible suitors at bay.  Nonetheless Emily keeps ""a crayon portrait"" of him displayed in the parlor ""on a tarnished gilt easel before the fireplace"" (120).</p>","Yes"
"21276","158","Emily Grierson","Grierson, Emily","Mr. Grierson","<p>Miss Emily, as the narrator of ""A Rose for Emily"" explains, is “a tradition, a duty, and a care, a sort of hereditary obligation upon the town” (119). In other words, she is a recluse and a source of fascination for the townspeople of Jefferson, who keep a constant eye on her doings. She never married, and her domineering father kept potential suitors away from her, but after his death she had a potentially scandalous relationship with a single suitor, a Yankee stranger named Homer Barron. Although her exact birthdate is unknown, it is likely she was born around 1850 - in any case before the Civil War.  Her death is the point at which the story begins.  The meaning of her life as a totemic Southern lady is the (implicit) question the story revolves around.  ""A Rose for Emily"" is the only text she appears in.</p>","Yes"
"21275","1331","Mrs. Rouncewell","Rouncewell, Mrs.","","<p>In <em>The Town</em>, as the florist in Jefferson, ""Mrs Rouncewell"" gives her name to a memorable event in Jefferson history, the ""Mrs Rouncewell panic"" (81).  This ensues when her shop runs out of flowers before a major dance.  ""She ran the flower shop; not . . . because she loved flowers nor even because she loved money but because she loved funerals; she had buried two husbands herself and took the second one's insurance and opened the flower shop and furnished the flowers for every funeral in Jefferson since"" (73).  In the next novel in the Snopes trilogy, <em>The Mansion</em>, Mrs. Rouncewell runs the boarding house where Flem Snopes lives for a while.  She calls it ""the Commercial Hotel"" (143).  In that novel she may also be the mother of the Rouncewell boy who discovers the robbers in Willy Christian's drug store, but that is not made clear.  ""Rouncewell"" is also the name of another boarding house, in ""Tomorrow,"" and a Jefferson store, in ""Go Down, Moses"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.  It seems likely that this character, or at least others in her immediate family, are connected to these locations.</p>","Yes"
"21273","1330","(Little) Belle Mitchell","Mitchell, (Little) Belle","Belle Mitchell Benbow, Harry Mitchell","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Little Belle is the young daughter of Belle and Harry Mitchell who, by the end, is Horace Benbow's step-daughter - though Belle herself makes it clear to her new acquaintances in the new town she lives in ""that Horace is not her real daddy"" (378).  When she appears again in <em>Sanctuary</em> she is a young woman.  While she never appears directly in that novel, except as a voice on the far end of a telephone, she plays a major role in the story: it is her sexuality mated with her barely disguised disdain for Horace that drives him from Kinston to make his way home again to Jefferson - where he keeps a photo of her (and not his wife) beside the bed he sleeps in. She may not be as promiscuous as Horace imagines, but as a modern young woman she is clearly a threat to both his idea of femininity and his peace of mind.</p>","Yes"
"21272","1329","McCarron, Father of Hoke","McCarron, Father of Hoake","","<p>Hoake McCarron's father makes a dashing figure in <em>The Hamlet</em>: a ""handsome, ready-tongued, assured and pleasant man who had come into the country without specific antecedents and no definite past"" (148). He makes a living gambling ""in the back rooms of country stores or the tack rooms of stables"" (149) until he elopes with Alison Hoake, returning ten days later to become a good husband and father. He is killed, however, in a gambling house and was allegedly shot by a woman. After his death, ""there remained only the legend of the money and jewels he was supposed to have won"" and ""bricked up in one of the chimneys of the house"" (150).  In <em>The Mansion</em>, where Hoake is spelled Hoke, he is only briefly mentioned but not named by Hoke himself (194).</p>","Yes"
"21271","1328","Alison Hoake McCarron","McCarron, Alison Hoake","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> the mother of Hoake McCarron, Alison McCarron, comes from wealth as her deceased mother was the daughter of a ""well-to-do"" landowner (149). At nineteen, she eloped with Mr. McCarron a gambler with no definite past, climbing out of a second-story window to avoid her father.  Her story is omitted in <em>The Mansion</em>, where she is merely described as a ""well-to-do"" widow (139).</p>","Yes"
"21270","1327","Tom-Tom Bird","Bird, Tom-Tom","","<p>As ""Tom-Tom"" in ""Centaur in Brass"" and as ""Tom Tom"" in <em>The Town</em>, he works as the day fireman for Jefferson's power plant.  (In this context a 'fireman' is someone who keeps a fire in a boiler burning, not one who puts fires out.)  In both texts he is a ""big bull of a man weighing two hundred pounds, ""sixty years old,"" and married to a young wife he maintains ""with the strict jealous seclusion of a Turk in a cabin about two miles down the railroad track from the plant"" (16, 152).</p>","Yes"
"21269","1332","Lorraine","Lorraine","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Lorraine is the woman Jason is seeing in Memphis, Tennessee.  In the letter she sends him, she calls Jason ""my sweet daddy"" (193).  Their relationship seems based on the money he gives her and the sex she gives him.  Jason thinks of her as ""a good honest whore"" (233).  His ideas about other people, especially women, are hardly reliable, but in this case it does seem likely that Lorraine is one of the many Memphis prostitutes in Faulkner's fiction.  Presumably she is also the woman in the ""Appendix Compson"" whom the residents of Jefferson refer to euphemistically as Jason's ""friend from Memphis"" (340).  (There is also a Miss Lorraine in <em>Sanctuary</em> who seems to be the madam of a Memphis bordello, but based on her description it seems likely that she is a different character.)</p>","Yes"
"21260","1325","Thomas Pettigrew's Mother","Pettigrew, Mother of Thomas","","<p>The mother of the mail rider in ""A Name for the City"" and again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> was ""from old Ferginny"" (23). When she named her son ""Thomas Jefferson Pettigrew,"" hoping that that famous name might bring her son some ""luck,"" she also indirectly provided the county seat of Yoknapatawpha with its name (23).</p>","No"
"21259","1324","Thomas Jefferson","Jefferson, Thomas","","<p>Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. President and indirect source of the name of Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha, is only mentioned in two of the fictions: ""A Name for City"" and again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.  Both these texts explain how, by way of a mail carrier named Pettigrew, Jefferson acquired its name; neither says anything about Jefferson as a man or President.</p>","No"
"21257","1323","Sebastian Gualdres","Gualdres, Sebastian","","<p>In ""Knight's Gambit"" Sebastian Gualdres is ""the Argentine cavalry captain"" whom Mrs. Harriss and her children meet in South America after Mr. Harriss’s death (170).  He is one of the more exotic figures to appear in Yoknapatawpha.  The narrative notes the stereotypical assumptions that the people of Yoknapatawpha have about him as ""a Latin"" (174), but in its depiction of his courtesy, his pride and his machismo, the narrative itself seems not unwilling to reinforce the stereotypes.  Gavin Stevens calls him a ""dark romantic foreign knight"" (192, though he is not the ""knight"" of the story's title).  Gualdres calls himself a ""simple gaucho, paysano"" (238).   (A ""paysano"" is a countryman of the Argentine; the term is often used synonymously with “gaucho.)  Max Harriss calls him ""a fortune-hunting Spick"" (144).  Much to Max’s annoyance, Gualdres is better at everything - horses, fencing, women - that the young Yoknapatawphan thinks he has mastered.   Gualdres’s sexuality is an interesting question.  He has an affair with Miss Cayley, a young woman from a neighboring farm.  But there is something Whitmanesque and potentially homoerotic about his circle of male acquaintances in Yoknapatawpha: ""out-of-doors men, usually bachelors"" (174).  Stevens, with his knight’s gambit, manages both to save Gualdres's life, and to maneuver the Argentinian captain into marrying Miss Harriss, and then, indirectly, into enlisting as a private in ""a 1942 United States Army cavalry regiment"" (254).  When <em>The Mansion</em> briefly retells the story of ""Knight's Gambit,"" he is referred to simply as a ""steeple-chasing cavalry officer"" from Argentina (282).</p>","Yes"
"21256","1322","John McLendon|Jackson McLendon","McLendon, John|Jackson","Lendon, Mother of Mack","<p>This man appears in four texts under three different names; in all four he is associated with World War I, but in very different ways.  In ""Dry September"" he is John McLendon, a decorated veteran who takes command of the lynch mob; he has a ""heavy-set body,"" an aggressive temperament, and a wife whom he violently abuses (171).   He plays a much smaller role as McLendon in <em>Light in August</em>: a customer at the barbershop who was there when Christmas ""run in and dragged [Lucas Burch] out"" (87).  In <em>The Town</em> he is Jackson McLendon when he organizes and commands a company of volunteers from Jefferson during World War I.  In his final appearance, in <em>The Mansion</em>, he is Mack Lendon, ""one of a big family of brothers in a big house"" (205). A ""cotton man, a buyer for one of the Memphis export houses"" (207), when the U.S. enters World War I he organizes a group of local volunteers into the Sartoris Rifles, of which he is the original Captain. But according to Charles Mallison, he was ""such a bad company commander that he was relieved of his command long before it ever saw the lines"" (206).  (If we take into account the version of ""Dry September"" that appeared in <em>Scribner's</em> magazine, he actually has a fourth name: John Plunkett.)</p>","Yes"
"21255","1321","Turpin 2","Turpin 2","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> the name ""Turpin"" comes up in two different chronological contexts.

The salesman whom they send to Yoknapatawpha gives us a good idea of their strictly capitalist ethic when he expresses disbelief that these executives would ""send this machine out without any down payment"" (228, 78).</p>","No"
"21246","1318","Unnamed Negro Young Men","Unnamed Negro Young Men","","<p>In ""A Point of Law"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Lucas Beauchamp compares George Wilkins favorably as a son-in-law to ""the other buck niggers"" in his neighborhood (213; in the novel this phrase is revised to ""nigger bucks,"" 34).  By these offensive terms Lucas refers to other eligible young black males who live nearby.

"21245","1317","Unnamed United States Attorney","Unnamed United States Attorney","","<p>In ""A Point of Law"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> the ""United States Attorney"" who is present during Judge Gowan's hearing on the case against Lucas and George is an outsider who ""moved to Jefferson only after the administration changed eight years ago"" (222, 70).  This probably makes him an appointee of President Franklin Roosevelt, though that is not said explicitly.  He is described as both ""angry-looking"" (221, 70) and ""angry"" (222, 71).  Secure in his local knowledge and authority, Judge Gowan ignores his one exasperated but uncompleted remark.</p>","Yes"
"21244","1316","Unnamed Tenant Farmers 2","Unnamed Tenant Farmers 2","","<p>The crowd outside the courthouse in ""A Point of Law"" includes ""other tenants"" from the McCaslin-Edmonds place (221).  When Faulkner included this scene in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, he revised the description to read ""other people"" rather than ""tenants"" (69).  In both texts these poor Negroes are contrasted with the powerful white men on the scene.</p>","Yes"
"21242","1315","Unnamed Moonshine Buyers 2","Unnamed Moonshine Buyers 2","","<p>The ""regular customers"" for Lucas Beauchamp's moonshine - whom he thinks of in ""A Point of Law"" as his ""established clientele"" (213-14) and in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> as his ""established trade"" (35) - are not described in either text. It can safely be assumed from the other fictions that all are male. And given the way moonshine is bought and consumed throughout Faulkner's fiction, it is probably safe to assume they are of both races and from various levels of Yoknapatawpha society.</p>","Yes"
"21241","1314","Unnamed Lawyers","Unnamed Lawyers","","<p>Outside the courthouse in ""A Point of Law"" are ""rich white lawyers talking to one another around cigars, the proud and powerful of the earth"" (221).  When this scene recurs in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the people in the group are referred to as ""lawyers and judges and marshals"" (69).   In both texts, the critical perspective on these people seems shared by both Lucas and the narrative.</p>","Yes"
"21240","1313","Unnamed Federal Commissioner","Unnamed Federal Commissioner","","<p>Although we never learn the name of the ""commissioner"" mentioned in ""A Point of Law"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, or much else about him, we know the man who signs the indictments against Lucas and George for moonshining is a federal official - his office is in ""the federal courthouse"" (216), and moonshining was a federal crime.</p>","Yes"
"21236","1311","Unnamed Chancery Clerk 2","Unnamed Chancery Clerk 1","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Gavin Stevens checks the deed for Meadowfill's property in ""the Chancery Clerk's office"" - which is the only way this official appears in the novel (367).  Typically, a chancery clerk would have been elected to his position. His job would have had him collecting data and presiding over the chancery court records, which would have dealt with disputes adjudicated in the court, centering on land and contracts.</p>","Yes"
"21235","1310","Unnamed Chancery Clerk 1","Unnamed Chancery Clerk 1","","<p>Typically, the ""Chancery Clerk"" mentioned by the narrator of ""The Old People"" would have been elected to his position (204) .  His job would include collecting demographic data and presiding over the chancery court records, which mainly dealt with disputes about property and contracts adjudicated in the court.   (Curiously, all mention of this person is gone from the version of the story Faulkner includes in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>: there the phrase is ""chancery book in Jefferson,"" 163).</p>","Yes"

He is called both Joe Baker (by the narrator of the story, 205) and Jobaker (by the narrator of the novel, 164, and by himself in both texts, 204, 163). His history is unknown. He ""lived in a foul little shack at the fork of the creek"" (204, 163). Living as a hermit, he hunted and fished for his livelihood. He would sometimes visit Fathers in the blacksmith shop, where the two old men spoke ""a mixture of negroid English and flat hill dialect"" with an occasional word or two in the old Chickasaw vocabulary (205, 163). The story suggests Sam plays a role, perhaps a traditional Chickasaw role, in Jobaker's death and the burning of his hut. According to the narrator, ""nobody ever found Joe Baker's grave"" (205, 164).</p>","Yes"
"21232","1308","Unnamed Whites in Crowd","Unnamed Whites in Crowd","","<p>In ""Go Down, Moses"" and again in the chapter with that title in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the crowd that watches as the coffin carrying Samuel Beauchamp is taken off the train contains a ""number of Negroes and whites both"" (265, 363).

In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> - where Mollie is named Molly again, Miss Worsham is named Miss Habersham, and Molly's father is not mentioned - the reference to Molly's mother adds the detail that both Molly and Miss Habersham ""suckled at Molly's mother's breast"" (85).</p>","Yes"

He may be referring exclusively to the Sartoris slaves who are named in the story - Louvinia, Joby and Yance - but it's more likely that he also expects Bayard to include Philadelphia and Loosh in that phrase, and perhaps all the plantation's enslaved population as well.  The revised version of ""Ambuscade"" that appears in the novel refers, obliquely, to these slaves when Bayard mentions the ""negroes"" who called John Sartoris' room the office (15) - which is where they would face the patroller ""and swear that they could not possibly have been either who or where he (the Patroller) said they were"" (16).</p>","Yes"

Bayard's meaning seems to be that while this man is a newly emancipated slave, he has no interest in joining the group of blacks who do want to vote.  The man takes one look at the white men who have assembled in the Square on election day, says ""Gret Gawd,"" and retreats into the hotel.</p>","Yes"

In ""Lion"" Quentin describes the man in terms that, like the entire episode, will make a 21st century sensibility wince: ""They said he was a bad nigger, but I don't know"" (189).  When the scene was revised for the novel, the third-person narrator calls him a ""negro"" instead (223).  In both texts this man is armed with ""a dollar-and-a-half mail order pistol"" that misfires (189, 223).  Boon ""hits"" him ""in the face"" with his last shot in the story - which explains why we say he 'dies,' though that's not made explicit; in the novel he misses the man entirely.

When he mentions the new dress, Lucius as narrator notes that ""there wasn't anything under"" the dress she was wearing when she was shot (15).  Faulkner had described this event in two earlier texts, ""Lion"" and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.  In both these texts she is called a ""woman"" (189, 223), and Boon accidentally hits her in the leg; there is no description of what happens to her next, expect that the novel adds: ""Major de Spain paid for that"" (223).</p>","Yes"

Even though Mrs. Grier twice asks de Spain ""what is your Negro's name?,"" and after the second question the Major actually ""calls the name,"" the narrator never tells us what it is (109).  The narrator does, however, note that the man moves ""without making any more noise than a cat"" when he takes away the pistol from the top of the coffin (109).  A more discordant note is struck when the narrator refers to ""the whites of the monkey nigger's eyes"" when he first opens the mansion's door (106); this extremely derogatory phrase presumably is intended realistically to represent the narrator's poor white background, but it is jarring at the outset of an episode that shows a poor white woman and a member of Yoknapatawpha's elite communing across <em>class</em> lines.</p>","Yes"

The text names one, Isham, and singles out another as ""the youngest Negro"" (274, 335) -  they have their own character entries.

"21002","1151","Unnamed Narrator 10","Unnamed Narrator 10","","<p>The narrator in ""A Courtship"" who tells the story of Ikkemotubbe, David Hogganbeck and Herman Basket's sister tells us very little about himself.  It's highly likely that he is male, though that is not definitively said.  He is an Indian: his use of ""us"" to refer to the Chickasaws and his reference to ""my father's house"" (369) locate him inside Issetibbeha's tribe, as does his diction, for example when he calls the helmsman on the steamboat the ""boy slave who turned the wheel"" (366) or uses ""moons and moons"" as a temporal reference (377).  But whether he is relating events that he saw firsthand or repeating a story about ""the old days"" that he was told is not clear (380).  Nor is it clear when Faulkner imagines him telling the story, or to whom.</p>","Yes"
"21001","1150","Unnamed Narrator 8","Unnamed Narrator 8","","<p>Although the boy who narrates the story of ""Uncle Willy"" says very little about himself, he is a recognizable version of other juvenile narrators in Faulkner's fiction, and a way for Faulkner to provide a perspective on both the story's unconventional protagonist and the conventional small-town world of Jefferson.  He likes playing baseball with his friends and eating the ice cream that Job makes at Willy's drugstore, is uncomfortable in school, and is willing ""to do anything [Willy] asked me to do"" (239).  His way of helping runs the gamut from buying ""Jamaica ginger"" to quiet Willy's craving for alcohol (234) to making sure that Willy can get his plane into the air on his suicidal flight from the adults, including the narrator's father, who want to save the old man from himself.  He is fourteen years old when the story begins (227), and apparently still fourteen when it ends over two years later (245).  He is ""some years"" older when he tells the story, since now, for example, he can identify the source of the smell that comes back with Willy from his visits to the brothels of Memphis (236), but it is not clear how much time has passed.  His view of Willy is unchanged.  He still thinks of the old man as ""the finest man I ever knew"" (225, 239) and believes Willy can teach him how to conquer mortality by ""having fun too when I had to get old"" (239).</p>","Yes"
"21000","1149","Unnamed Narrator 7","Unnamed Narrator 7","","<p>At the end of ""Smoke"" the story's narrator identifies himself as a member of the grand jury that hears Gavin Stevens's explanation of Anse Holland and Judge Dunkenfield's murders (""we, the jury,"" 27).  Hence, although we don't know his name, because Mississippi juries at this time were exclusively white and male, we do know his race and sex.  He is recounting the events from ""six months"" after the murder of Old Anse (4), and therefore probably not long after the murder of Judge Dukinfield.  Throughout, he explicitly defines his point of view as that of the town – ""we in Jefferson"" – as he defines the town: ""those of us whose fathers and grandfathers had been bred here"" (3).  His narrative judgments on the Holland family, the ""underbred outlander"" and his sons (4), are rendered as if they were the unanimous verdicts of the town, and on the whole he is very complacent about the values cherished by the ""men of our town and time and thinking"" (4).  At the same time, however, his report on the proceeding at the trial reveals something of the unpleasantness of Gavin Stevens’s unremitting showmanship as an attorney.</p>","Yes"

He is devoted to Mister Ernest, the landlord who adopted him at age ten after both his parents abandoned him. He is earnest and hard-working, and passionate about hunting, but also illiterate - though as Will Legate notes, he ""knows every cuss word in the dictionary, every poker hand in the deck and every whisky label in the distillery"" (296).  At the end of the story Mister Ernest tells him it's time for him to start going to school, and there's no reason to think he would disobey; however, the idiomatic nature of his narrative - ""et"" for ate (296), ""I would 'a' had to"" for ""I would have had to"" (297), and so on - suggests he is telling it orally rather than writing it.</p>","No"

After leaving his position as a bookkeeper for a bank, he took to the road selling a ""line of work shirts and overalls"" (137).

"20997","1146","Unnamed Narrator 5","Unnamed Narrator 5","","<p>The narrator of ""Death Drag"" describes the unusual appearance in his little town of three barnstormers and the town's reaction to them and their stunts.  He identifies himself as one of the town's older citizens, a ""groundling,"" or non-flyer (197). Interestingly enough, the narrator qualifies his identification of Ginsfarb and Jake as Jews:  ""That is, [the spectators] knew at once that two of the strangers were of a different race from themselves, without being able to say what the difference was"" (188). The narrator, who might or might not share the stereotypical views of his day, offers a communal point of view, describing what ""we"" saw and heard and did in response to the barnstormers (185).</p>","Yes"
"20996","1145","Unnamed Narrator 6","Unnamed Narrator 6","","<p>The narrator of ""Centaur in Brass"" remains unnamed.  (When Faulkner develops the episode in <em>The Town</em>, Chick Mallison retells the story as he heard it from his cousin Gowan.)  This narrator, like that of ""A Rose for Emily,"" refers to himself in the first-person plural, ""we believed,"" ""our ears,"" etc. (149, 150), and serves as a kind of communal voice for ""our town"" (149); but he also occupies a privileged narrative position as one of four people who know what the water tower means to Flem Snopes, ""that it is his monument, or that it is a monument at all"" (149).  That knowledge he was apparently gained from the man called Harker, who shares the role of narrator, telling much of the story himself in quotation marks.</p>","Yes"
"20995","1144","Unnamed Narrator 4","Unnamed Narrator 4","","<p>The unnamed narrator of ""All the Dead Pilots"" seems to be a captain like Spoomer, who greets him as an equal while the gunnery sergeant stands in recognition of his rank (518).  However, he doesn't seem to enforce his rank; the gunnery sergeant who is the source of much of his information has no qualms about discussing the antics of officers Spoomer and Sartoris with him, for example.  He is an inventor, a wartime military mail censor, and a casualty of war ""trying to get used to a mechanical leg"" (512).  A curious, sympathetic, and imaginative man, he is capable of recognizing the irony and the triviality of the Spoomer-Sartoris rivalry as well as the sad wastes of Sartoris' and the surviving pilots' lives in war.  We identify him as British because of how foreign Sartoris and America seem to be to him.</p>","No"
"20994","1143","Unnamed Narrator 2","Unnamed Narrator 2","","<p>The unnamed narrator of ""Ad Astra"" served during World War I as an American flying in a British squadron (408).  In his only explicit references to himself, he talks about the ""pleasant"" but tense feeling that precedes the moment ""in combat"" when ""you know something is about to happen"" (421).  Until the last pages of the story he remains a silent witness to the events, but he reports what the others say and do clearly and without bias.</p>","No"
"20993","603","Unnamed Narrator 1","Unnamed Narrator 1","","<p>""A Rose for Emily"" is a first-person narrative, but the identity of its narrator is very hard to establish.  It seems very safe to say that his race is ""White"" - note, for example, how consistently he refers to Tobe as ""the Negro"" (120, 121 etc.).  We also assume the narrator is male; at times the differing actions and motives of ""the men"" and ""the women"" are narrated with equal detachment (119, etc.), but phrases like ""only a woman could have believed"" mayor Sartoris' fiction about the taxes make it seem more likely that narrator is a man.  The narrator's age is equally elusive, given the equally detached way ""he"" talks about ""Colonel Sartoris' generation"" and ""the next generation"" (120, etc.).  He seems to feel a slight resentment at the Grierson's upper-class status, which may imply that ""he"" is middle class, but that is by no means clear.  He is explicitly present when the locked door is broken in at the end (""for a long while we just stood there,"" 130), but inexplicably, or at least in a way that is never explained, ""he"" also seems implicitly to be present at every other scene he describes, from the midnight visit to de-odorize Emily's house to the funeral for her.  Given the way the narrator refers to himself with the first-person plural - ""we,"" ""our"" - the voice of the story could be identified as a collective one, the way ""the town"" regards and discusses Emily over many different decades.  In other texts, Faulkner often has a third-person narrator quote or paraphrase what ""the town"" or ""the people"" say or think about the story's events.  But if that is his idea here, then it is important to note that the <em>race</em> of this narrator is unambiguously <em>white</em>, that ""Negroes"" are consistently depicted as outside the communal ""we"" that the narrative constructs, that his references to something like ""our whole town"" (119) implicitly refer only to 'the white people of Jefferson.'</p>","Yes"

Sometime before the novel begins he has somehow made his way to Frenchman's Bend, where he lives in the Old Frenchman place with Ruby Lamar and their sickly infant, and earns his living making whiskey which he sells to locals and to the speakeasies of Memphis.  When he is mentioned again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> he is referred to only as the ""moonshiner"" who lives at the scene of the murder and kidnapping (108) and as the falsely accused ""man"" whose life Temple ""swears away"" (101).</p>","Yes"

He is repeatedly referred to as ""the white man"" during the exchange with Rider.

Mrs. Compson and other Jefferson townspeople have asked him to officiate at Granny's funeral, presumably because of her status as both an Episcopalian and a member of the local aristocracy.

"20965","592","Unnamed Memphis Lawyer","Unnamed Memphis Lawyer","","<p>The first time this lawyer is mentioned in <em>Sanctuary</em> is in an antisemitic rant by Clarence Snopes about ""a Memphis jew lawyer"" (266).  He appears in person on the day Temple testifies in court; he sits ""picking his teeth"" at the prosecution's table.  There Horace refers to him as ""a Jew lawyer from Memphis"" (282).  The narrative's description is less overtly hostile, but phrases like ""his skull was capped closely by tight-curled black hair"" and ""he had a long, pale nose"" (281) do emphasize his ethnicity.  His connection with Memphis suggests he represents Popeye's interests.  Since we know that Clarence has sold him information about Temple's whereabouts, it seems likely that he is responsible for bringing her to Yoknapatawpha, and may even be responsible for the lies she tells on the stand.

In that novel  Bayard calls them ""pretty good men,"" but adds that they ""quit fighting and went home too often"" (229); Jenny calls them ""a bunch of red-neck brigands"" (238).  These men play more significant roles both during and after the War in the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories ""Retreat,"" ""Raid,"" ""Skirmish at Sartoris,"" and are still loyal to and prepared to fight for the dead Colonel's cause in that novel's final chapter, ""An Odor of Verbena.""  As Bayard says in ""Retreat,"" unlike the first unit that Sartoris organized in Yoknapatawpha, it's ""not a regiment,"" containing only ""about fifty"" men (22).

At least some of them are stealing the ""stock,"" i.e. the livestock, of the farmers in the area, and ""five men"" from the second group  attack Granny and her party (25, 58). Bayard notes that some of them, at least, are wearing ""blue coats"" (25, 58), so it's possible that they are Union troops foraging or scourging the countryside, or even deserters from the Union army, but their behavior makes it more likely that they are one of the many bands of marauders who took advantage of the chaos caused by the Civil War to pillage for their own advantage.</p>","No"

Outside Chapter 8, the only hint of his existence is in Mr. Compson's ambiguous reference to ""the shadowy figure of a legal guardian"" in Bon's life (58).  In their reconstruction of the story in Chapter 8, however, Shreve and Quentin bring this character vividly to life as a materialistic schemer, more venal than evil, who keeps track of Thomas Sutpen's mounting wealth on a ""secret paper"" in a ""secret drawer"" in a ""secret safe"" in his office (241), where he sits ""adding and subtracting the money"" he can make (247) by manipulating ""his private mad female millionaire"" and her victimized son (241).</p>","No"

When Horace visits the brothel to talk with Temple, Reba tells him that she's done business with many lawyers, including ""the biggest lawyer in Memphis"" - and when she adds that this man weighed 280 pounds and ""had his own special bed made and sent down here,"" ""biggest"" acquires an additional meaning (211).

"20924","1097","Unnamed Jefferson Ladies 3","Unnamed Jefferson Ladies 3","","<p>In ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" and again in the chapter with that title in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Bayard says that ""all the ladies in Jefferson"" (58) - in the second text this is revised to ""all the women in Jefferson"" (188) - travel out to the Sartoris plantation on several occasions: to confront Drusilla for her unlady-like behavior and to attend the wedding that will ceremonialize her return to their fold.  The first time they appear, there are ""fourteen of them,"" though that total includes Martha Habersham (63, 194).  They all seem both curious and outraged by what they see.  The narrative juxtaposes the mission of these ladies to the work John Sartoris and their husbands are doing ""back in Jefferson"" to preserve their white male power (63, 194).  (Note how small this group is: either as ""ladies"" or as ""women,"" ""all"" such people in Jefferson are white, and upper class.)</p>","Yes"

And he notes the absence of the children who should have been on their porches on Sunday morning, ""fresh and scrubbed for Sunday school with clutched palm-sweaty nickels"" - but ""perhaps by mutual consent"" Sunday school has been cancelled (38).

That quotation is from <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, where he is unnamed but  described vividly as ""a grease-covered man with the eyes of a visionary monk"" (190).  In the last two novels of the Snopes trilogy he is named Buffaloe.  <em>The Town</em> identifies him as the ""city electrician"" and a ""genius"" who ""in 1904 . . . drove out of his backyard into the street in the first automobile we had ever seen, made by hand completely"" (12).  In <em>The Reivers</em> he is named Bullock.  That novel gives the most narrative attention to his achievement.  When a stranger drives into Jefferson in the first car ever seen in the town, Bullock takes it apart ""to find out why it ran"" (28) and a year later builds one himself.  When it is banned from the streets, he converts ""an area of open land behind his house"" into ""a fair motordrome,"" or test track, where he can continue to drive it (30).

"20915","571","Unnamed Inhabitants of Modern Jefferson","Unnamed Inhabitants of Modern Jefferson","","<p>The short story ""A Name for the City"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> both characterize the inhabitants of Jefferson in the middle of the 20th century fairly negatively.  The novel develops that critique in more detail. The boasting about progress done by Jefferson's members of ""Rotary and Lions Clubs and Chambers of Commerce and City Beautifuls"" (201, 4) is described as ""a furious beating of hollow drums toward nowhere, but merely to sound louder than the next little human clotting to its north or south or east or west, dubbing itself city as Napoleon dubbed himself emperor"" (4).  While these leaders ""confound forever seething with motion and motion with progress"" (4), the novel provides its own account of that process.  When they first lay out the plan of the courthouse and the town on the uncleared ground under a ""grove of oaks,"" the settlers themselves have a vision of the ""lawyers and doctors and dentists"" and others who will someday live around the as-yet-unbuilt Square (31).  Less respectable are the men whom the narrator refers to as ""white-skinned rascals and demagogues and white supremacy champions"" who are among the men elected to office by black voters as well as white (38), and the ""county fathers"" who scheme to tear down and replace the courthouse (38).  In the last part of the novel, the narrative refers to several more examples of these modern inhabitants: the ""high school students"" who remember the Governor who spent time in the jail (196); the ""new people in the town"" at mid-century - ""strangers, outlanders"" who live in small modern houses in ""new subdivisions"" (196).  On the other hand, the current population also includes what the narrator calls ""the irreconcilable Jeffersonians and Yoknapatawphians"" (198), older inhabitants who remain estranged from the modern elements of the town and loyal to such ""obsolescent"" things as ""wood-burning ranges and cows and vegetable gardens"" (197).</p>","Yes"

(278, 277).  Its gender is not specified.  Swaddled in a ""blanket-and-tarpaulin-wrapped bundle,"" its physical appearance is never described, but legally it is ""black"" like its mother.  Since Don Boyd is its father, its last name could be his, but the story makes it clear that the white father will play no role whatsoever in any future the infant might have.  (When Faulkner revised the story for inclusion as a chapter in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the child is a boy; he still has no name, but his McCaslin genealogy gives him a radically new significance in the larger narrative of Yoknapatawpha.  Thus the novel's infant has his own entry in the database; see the entry for Roth Edmonds' Child.)</p>","No"
"20912","1091","Unnamed ""Hunters""","Unnamed ""Hunters""","","<p>There are various groups of hunters in the Yoknapatawpha fictions. These ""hunters"" are the essentially transcendent community created by the narrator at the start of the chapter called ""The Bear"" in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.  In this passage, ""hunters"" refers not to any specific characters but to an exalted meta-cultural and spiritual category of ""men"": they are ""not white nor black nor red but men, hunters"" (181).  They are explicitly distinguished from ""women,"" ""boys,"" and ""children"" by the ""brown liquor"" they drink (almost a kind of communion wine, a ""condensation of the wild immortal spirit"" of the wilderness) and by their liturgy: the stories they tell about hunting.  According to this passage, even the camp cooks are ""hunters first and cooks afterward"" (185).

Ike can remember how they ""shot wild turkey with pistols to test their stalking skills and marksmanship, feeding all but the breast to the dogs"" (267, 319).

"20898","564","Unnamed Golfers","Unnamed Golfers","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> on both Saturday and Sunday (the first and fourth sections of the novel) various groups of golfers are described playing on the course beside the Compson place. Consistent with the severe conceptual limitations of Benjy's mind, his descriptions of them are very confusing: ""they went to the table, and he hit and the other hit"" (3). When the third person narrator describes the same actions in the fourth section, it becomes easy to see who is there and what they are doing: Benjy and Luster ""watched the foursome . . . move to the tee and drive"" (315).  When the golfers appear again, the style in which they are described is unmistakably Faulkner's: ""humanbeings swinging golfsticks"" (340).</p>","Yes"

The little girl in the family comes home from school just as Caddy used to.  She is used to Benjy ""running along the fence"" (53), and unafraid.  When Benjy finds the gate unlocked one day after Caddy's wedding, he catches at this girl and ""tries to say"" (53) something to her - he himself cannot say what even to himself - but her father, assuming he intends to assault her, knocks him out with a fence picket.  She is not named in the ""Appendix"" Faulkner wrote to the novel in 1945, but referred to as the ""passing female child"" whom Benjy accosts; the acount there of Benjy's ""fumbling abortive attempt"" to engage with her makes it seem more likely that Mr. Burgess was right (339).</p>","Yes"
"20896","563","Unnamed Girl","Unnamed Girl","","<p>In <em>Sanctuary</em> Temple mentions this young woman while talking to Horace: ""a girl"" who ""went abroad one summer"" and after she came back told Temple about chastity belts (217).

"20891","560","Unnamed First Aboriginal","Unnamed First Aboriginal","","<p>In three differents versions of the story of Lion, Old Ben and the hunt, Faulkner evokes a prehistoric context for the ritual.  In ""Lion"" it is Quentin Compson who, waiting on his assigned stand in the bayou, realizes that the scene before him is no different in appearance from what it was when, long ago, the first human explorer of the wilderness in Yoknpatawpha ""crept into it and looked around, arrow poised and ready"" (192).  In the later texts ""The Bear"" and in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Faulkner revises this a bit, partly to adapt it to the new protagonists - Ike McCaslin and Sam Fathers.  The ""first Indian"" of ""Lion"" (192) becomes the  ""the first ancestor of Sam Fathers' Chickasaw predecessors"" (285, 192).  And his weapon might have been a ""club or stone ax or bone arrow,"" which pushes this aboriginal moment still further back into the past (285, 192).

"20888","1078","Unnamed Tenant Farmers 4","Unnamed Tenant Farmers 4","","<p>in <em>The Town</em> the class of ""nameless tenants and croppers"" is referred to by Gavin Stevens in his account of Flem Snopes' desire to undermine Manfred de Spain.  Although the context is a long way from their actual lives,  these people who farm land they do not own are described as ""unfutured, barely-solvent one-bale tenant farmers [who] pervaded, covered thinly the whole county and on [whom] in fact the entire cotton economy of the county was founded and supported"" (293).  The phrase ""one-bale"" is explained by what Gavin says a few pages earlier: the ""sole cash value"" of each ""share-cropper"" is ""the October or November sale of the single bale of cotton which was his tithe of his year's work"" (291).</p>","Yes"
"20887","1077","Unnamed Tenant Farmers 3","Unnamed Tenant Farmers 3","","<p>After the Civil War slave labor on Yoknapatawpha's large plantations was often replaced by tenant labor.  Two generations of sharecroppers are mentioned in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>: the ""men and women, Negro and white both, who were born to and who passed all their lives in denim overalls and calico,"" and their ""sons and daughters,"" who wear ""the installment-plan garments"" advertised in national magazines (192).  According to the novel's exaggerated account, the first group, ""an entire generation of farmers,"" has vanished (193).  As the whole passage makes explicit, both white and black families worked for landlords as tenant farmers, but in the description of the old ways, the narrative focuses on ""the Negro tenant- or share- or furnish-hand"" who lived in rows of ""two-room shotgun shacks"" on the large plantations (193).</p>","Yes"
"20886","684","Unnamed Negro Tenant Farmers 3","Unnamed Negro Tenant Farmers 3","","<p>In ""Go Down, Moses"" and again in the chapter with that title in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> Gavin Stevens notes that ""the only white person"" on the McCaslin-Edmonds place is Roth Edmonds himself (260, 357).  Although he doesn't say so explicitly, the rest of the community there is made up of the black tenant farmers, sharecroppers, who farm small parcels of the land he owns.  Stevens is sure ""they wouldn't"" tell Mollie about her grandson's fate, even if they ever ""hear about it"" (260, 357).</p>","Yes"
"20885","1076","Unnamed Negro Tenant Farmers 1","Unnamed Negro Tenant Farmers 1","","<p>As the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> says, ""the Sartoris place was farmed on shares"" (289).   The black tenant farmers are not slaves, though Simon thinks of them as ""field niggers,"" a label left over from slavery (241).  In the narrative these share croppers are more like part of the landscape than characters, but they are mentioned several times - first when they ""raise their hands"" to ""salute"" Bayard as he drives home from the bank at the beginning of the novel (8).</p>","Yes"
"20884","635","Unnamed Negro Tenant Farmers 5","Unnamed Negro Tenant Farmers 5","","<p>The Negroes who work the land at the Harriss plantation are variously referred to in ""Knight's Gambit"" as ""croppers"" and ""tenants"" (163).  As the owners of the land, both Mrs. Harriss' father and her husband use the tenant system, which became widespread across the South in the aftermath of Emancipation.  The narrative notes that Mrs. Harriss' father managed the system in such a way that ""a plow-team and its driver from the field could be spared"" to drive the white family's carriage - an ""old battered Victoria"" - whenever his daughter wanted to go to Jefferson (155).  Mr. Harriss is described as an ""absentee-landlord"" (158), and soon turns the system over to a ""renter,"" who oversees relations with the tenants (160).  When he decides to import his ""own Negro farm-hands"" from Memphis, ""the Negroes who had lived and dropped their sweat on the old place"" for years ""were gone"" (160).</p>","Yes"

Their discussion suggests all five live nearby.  Their ""overalls"" and ""squatting"" posture suggest they are all farmers.  But the narrative gives no other details to identify them as a group, and distinguishes them from each other only as ""the first,"" ""a second,"" ""a third"" and ""a fourth"" (156-57).

No one in Jefferson ""knows anything about him,"" but he arrives in town with ""letters to the church,"" which is apparently the basis on which he is hired (232).  He completely transforms the store - making it attractive to the ""town trade"" that had previously shunned it (233).  When Willy returns to town free from his addiction to morphine, the clerk surreptitiously provides him with his new drug of choice - whiskey - while continuing to run the drugstore.  But all this turns out to be a kind of facade behind which the clerk robs the store of all its assets and disappears with the profits.</p>","Yes"

"20856","1060","Unnamed Country People 1","Unnamed Country People 1","","<p><em>Sanctuary</em> describes the various farmers and their wives who come into Jefferson on the weekend.  Horace, for example, watches while three of these women get down from a wagon and ""don various finery"" on the street in front of his house.  'Country people' in this novel can be black or white: ""the women on foot, black and white, unmistakable by the unease of their garments,"" and the men ""in slow overalls and khaki"" who move in crowds through the town square and stand in throngs ""listening"" to the music playing on radios and phonographs in record and drug stores (111, 112).

The last chapter opens with Chick watching them from the window of his uncle's office: ""people black and white"" (231), ""men and women and children too then and the old people and the babies and the young couples"" (230).   This is on a Saturday, when ""all the Negroes and most of the whites too from the county come in"" to town (23) - although not after word gets out about Lucas' arrest.  Ordinarily, on Monday some of these country people return to town for ""stock-auction day at the sales barns behind the Square"" (131); Chick describes this kind of crowd too (made up mostly of men, though some women come too) even though on the Monday in the story they stay away from town.</p>","Yes"

Pearson's work with various relief agencies has taught him to expect the worst from country people, and he assumes that they are all shiftless and untrustworthy.

(He is probably Simon Strother, but this novel doesn't give any details about him so that identification is too speculative; on the other hand, when this same event is described in <em>The Mansion</em>, the unnamed Negro coachman is described with details that make it clear that Faulkner is thinking of Simon.)</p>","Yes"

"20837","1047","Unnamed Negro Cook 12","Unnamed Negro Cook 12","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Houston hires this woman ""to cook"" for him after his wife is killed (11), so presumably she is not the same cook as the one mentioned in <em>The Hamlet</em>, who cooks for Mr. and Mrs. Houston during the first two months of their marriage.</p>","Yes"

"20834","1046","Unnamed Negro Cook 10","Unnamed Negro Cook 10","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> Gavin Stevens describes seeing ""[Sheriff] Hampton's cook"" sitting in his kitchen eating greens with Lucas Beauchamp (219).  Gavin does not describe the cook at all, but it seems safe to assume that she is a Negro woman; for one reason, all but one of the cooks in the Yoknapatawpha fiction are, and for another, she is eating at the same table as Lucas.  Earlier Gavin calls her ""a hired town cook,"" who gets to the Sheriff's house ""at a decent hour about eight"" (106).</p>","Yes"

(And in the typescript version of ""Shingles"" she is referred to, twice, as the ""nigger cook.""  It would be interesting to know exactly how that ugly epithet came to be deleted; there is evidence that the editors of the national magazines that published Faulkner's short stories felt a lot more anxious about printing that word than Faulkner was.

"20829","1043","Unnamed Construction Workers 1","Unnamed Construction Workers 1","","<p>In ""Knight's Gambit"" there are two different but essentially interchangeable groups of workers who turn the old plantation that Harriss inherits into a conspicuously modern and lavish show place.  The text even uses the same word to describe both groups: gangs.  First on the scene are the ""gangs of strange men with enough machinery to have built a high-way or a reservoir"" who build the stables, paddock, and polo field (161).  Not long after this arrive the ""gangs of workmen"" who create the steeplechase course: ""cutting out whole panels of the costly plank-and-rail fences and the outermost and still costly wire fences too, then in the resulting gaps setting lower makeshift barriers of brush-tops and laths"" (164).</p>","Yes"

"20825","1040","Unnamed Confederate Veterans 5","Unnamed Confederate Veterans 5","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Gavin Stevens refers with both irony and sentimentality to the remaining veterans of the Civil War as the ""heroes of our gallant lost irrevocable unreconstructible debacle""; ""half a century"" after the end of the Civil War these old men are revered by ""all"" the people of Yoknapatawpha (44).   As Charles Mallison explains, the descendants of these men are often ""called General or Colonel or Major because their fathers or grandfathers had been generals or colonels or majors or maybe just privates"" (10).

His appearance catches the eye of the jailer's daughter, who marries him ""six months later"" (49). When Faulkner retells this story from <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, he expands it quite a bit.  The ""gaunt and tattered, battle-grimed and fleeing and undefeated"" lieutenant is leading the Confederate cavalrymen fighting a rear-guard action against the Union troops attacking Jefferson when Cecilia Farmer first sees him (182); after the War they marry, and he takes her to live on the ""small hill farm"" he inherits from his father in Alabama (185).

He appears in the story about Grandfather Compson and one of his slaves that Dilsey told Versh, as Versh repeats it to Benjy (who of course cannot understand it at all).  According to the story, because Benjy's Grandfather changed the man's name (a common practice during slavery), the man became both a preacher and a ""bluegum"" (69).  Versh doesn't explain what he means by that, though according to dictionaries of American and African American slang, a bluegum is a black person whose lips and/or gums look purple or blue.  Being a bluegum apparently gives one a dangerous power: when this man looks at any ""family woman"" - i.e. enslaved women who are pregnant - her child is ""born bluegum""; later this man is eaten by those ""bluegum chillen"" (69).</p>","Yes"

"20730","499","Unnamed Negroes in Episcopalian Church","Unnamed Negroes in Episcopalian Church","","<p>In both the short story and the novel titled ""The Unvanquished,"" these Negroes are among the people in attendance at the secular service in the Episcopal Church when Rosa distributes money and mules to the needy people of Yoknapatawpha.  In his narrative, Bayard indicates that at the beginning of the Civil War they were enslaved, but now, presumably because their former masters are gone because of the War, Bayard calls them ""the dozen niggers that had got free by accident and didn't know what to do about it"" (84).  Along with Ringo, they sit in the church's ""slave gallery,"" which was built to hold 200 slaves, but now is otherwise deserted.</p>","Yes"
"20729","728","Woodrow Wilson","Wilson, Woodrow","","<p>The 28th President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson led the country into the First World War and was still in office when Rafe MacCallum mentions his name, disparagingly, in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (122).  He is mentioned again in <em>The Mansion</em>, where the U.S. Declaration of War against Germany on April 2, 1917, is referred to as ""the President's declaration"" (204). In the aftermath of World War I, Wilson was one of the key promoters of the League of Nations.</p>","No"
"20728","727","Winterbottom","Winterbottom","","<p>Never given a first name, Winterbottom is a farmer in Frenchman's Bend who has a small role in two texts and is mentioned in a third.  He is present at the auction in ""Spotted Horses.""  <em>Light in August</em> begins when Lena Grove walks past his farm.  And Flem Snopes mentions that he boarding ""at Winterbottom's"" near the end of <em>The Hamlet</em> (388).</p>","Yes"
"20727","726","Will Legate","Legate, Will","","<p>Will Legate appears in four fictions, primarily as an accomplished hunter.  He is a member of the Yoknapatawpha hunting party in ""Delta Autumn"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, a son of one of Ike's ""old companions, whom he had taught"" the discipline of hunting (268, 320). As a member of this newest generation of hunters, Legate is protective of Ike as ""a man your age,"" but shows only a little concern when another young hunter violates the code Ike taught him by killing a doe, and no concern at all for the ""pretty light-colored"" two-legged ""doe"" with whom that other hunter has an affair with (268-69, 321).  He plays a more admirable part in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, when the sheriff turns to him as ""one of the best woodsmen, the finest shot, and the best deer-hunter in the county"" (50) for help protecting Lucas Beauchamp from a possible lynching (51). In that story he is identified as a farmer""who lived on a small farm two miles from town"" (50).  His last appearance is in ""Race at Morning,"" where he is again on a hunting trip; called ""Willy Legate,"" he is the first character to call attention to the illiteracy of the narrator.</p>","Yes"

"20724","723","Walter Ewell","Ewell, Walter","","<p>Walter Ewell is a farmer in Yoknapatawpha, but in the six fictions where he appears or is mentioned he is always described as (to quote <em>The Mansion</em>) one of the ""best hunters in the county"" (34) - an assertion born out repeatedly on the annual hunting trips to Major de Spain's camp in the woods.  When the unnamed  boy in ""The Bear"" hunts his first deer on his own it is symbolically appropriate that ""he borrows Walter Ewell's rifle"" to do so (290).  Ewell is also part of the party of Yoknapatawpha hunters who, after World War II, travel to the Delta to hunt in ""Race at Morning,"" which makes him another of the characters in Faulkner's cast whose date of birth varies widely from text to text.</p>","Yes"

"20721","720","Unnamed Women and Negroes","Unnamed Women and Negroes","","<p>""The Unvanquished"" - both the story and the novel with that title - includes an unusual reference to ""white women"" and ""Negroes"" (149, 93).  The text brings these two groups together as the people in Yoknapatawpha who are equally threatened by the existence of Grumby's gang of ""Independents"" - though the ""white women"" are ""frightened"" while the Negroes are ""tortured"" (149, 93), and that it's hard to see what place Negro <em>women</em> occupy in this phrasing.</p>","Yes"

"20702","967","Unnamed Union Cavalry 3","Unnamed Union Cavalry 3","","<p>These are the Union troops, identified by Drusilla as ""a brigade of cavalry"" (45, 91), whom Bayard describes at the bridge over the river in ""Raid"" as both a short story and a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>.  Some of them are holding the crowd of self-emancipated slaves away from the bridge, others are preparing to blow it up, still others are described as ""riding up and down the cliff"" above the water or bivouacked ""down at the water"" (51, 108).</p>","No"

"20696","961","Unnamed Union Soldiers 8","Unnamed Union Soldiers 8","","<p>While no Union troops appear directly in ""Skirmish at Sartoris,"" either as a story or as a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, they are referred to at different points by Bayard, his father John, Drusilla and Ringo. Bayard notes that northeastern Mississippi ""had been full of Yankees"" for three years before they ""burned Jefferson"" and left the area at the end of 1864 (58, 188). John seems to think that if they returned they would help him and the other white men of Yoknapatawpha restore the order that had been disrupted by the War (65, 198). Drusilla tries to explain to the ladies that she joined John's unit ""to hurt Yankees"" (65, 197). And Ringo contrasts the northerners who come into Yoknapatawpha after the War with the troops who were there during it by saying in those earlier days you could recognize a ""Yankee"" ""because he never had nothing but a gun or a mule halter or a handful of hen feathers"" (66, 199).</p>","Yes"
"20695","710","Unnamed Union Soldiers 16","Unnamed Union Soldiers 16","","<p>These are the Union forces serving under General Smith in ""My Grandmother Millard"" who retreat ignobly in the face of a charge by a much smaller Confederate unit led by Lieutenant Backhouse.  It's not clear how large Smith's unit is, but it includes the ""outpost"" that Backhouse attacks, a ""main unit,"" and a troop of ""cavalry"" who screen the retreat (692).</p>","Yes"
"20694","709","Unnamed Union Soldiers 15","Unnamed Union Soldiers 15","","<p>These are the first Union troops to appear in Jefferson, according to ""My Grandmother Millard"": a ""Yankee scouting patrol"" that was apparently looking for General Compson ""over a year ago"" (675).  That would have been before April, 1861 - implausibly early in the Civil War for Union troops to be moving through Mississippi.</p>","Yes"
"20693","708","Unnamed Union Soldiers 14","Unnamed Union Soldiers 14","","<p>This second set of Yankees described in ""My Grandmother Millard"" seems to be an irregular, possibly even a renegade group: the ""six men in blue"" who charge on horseback onto the Sartoris property (676). They are armed with a battering ram because their mission is pillage rather than combat (674).  Bayard describes their ""faces"" as ""unshaven and wan"" and their demeanor as ""frantically gleeful""; their slovenliness suggests a lower class background and their glee an undisciplined lust for plunder (676).</p>","Yes"
"20692","707","Unnamed Union Soldiers 13","Unnamed Union Soldiers 13","","<p>This is the first of the Union units engaged by the narrative of ""My Grandmother Millard"": the ""whole regiment of Yankee cavalry"" that, according to Ab Snopes, is ""half a mile down the road"" from the Sartoris place (674).  (A Union regiment could be as large as 1000 men.)</p>","Yes"
"20691","960","Unnamed Union Soldiers 17","Unnamed Union Soldiers 17","","<p>As recounted in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, in 1864 these Union troops took control of Jefferson by force and ""burned to rubble"" the ""courthouse and everything else on or in the Square"" (48-49).  When <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> refers to this same event, it calls the Union troops who did the burning a ""United States military force"" (37).</p>","Yes"
"20690","957","Unnamed Union Soldiers 3","Unnamed Union Soldiers 3","","<p>Specific Union troops who appear in the various stories that Will Falls and Aunt Jenny tell in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> have their own separate entries in the data.  This entry represents the unspecified groups of Union soldiers and officers who are mentioned - often with extreme bias - in the novel.

"20689","956","Unnamed Union Cavalry 6","Unnamed Union Cavalry 6","","<p>In both the story and the novel ""The Unvanquished,"" this appears to be the last Union troop that Bayard sees in Yoknapatawpha during the War; it tracks Rosa Millard down to the Sartoris plantation to recover at least some of the dozens of stolen Yankee mules who remain in the county.</p>","Yes"
"20688","955","Unnamed Union Soldiers 2","Unnamed Union Soldiers 2","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and again in ""Retreat"" both as a short story and as a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, this company of Union soldiers is captured by Colonel Sartoris.  In the first novel he does so single-handedly, but in the next to he has some (involuntary) help from Bayard and Ringo.  In those two texts we assume this group is the ""column of Yankee infantry"" that earlier passes by Bayard and his father's troop hiding in the woods (30, 67).</p>","Yes"
"20687","706","Unnamed Union Cavalry 2","Unnamed Union Cavalry 2","","<p>In ""Ambuscade"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, this is the first group of Yankee soldiers to appear in Yoknapatawpha.  In ""Raid"" Louvinia remembers their arrival, and Rosa's note to their colonel identifies them as a regiment from Ohio.  To Ringo they look like ""the whole [Union] army"" (10), but it's more likely they comprise a single regiment of cavalry - or less.</p>","Yes"
"20686","954","Unnamed Union Soldiers 12","Unnamed Union Soldiers 12","","<p>The Union Army is only mentioned in <em>The Hamlet</em>, in the novel's reference to the groups of Union soldiers who patrolled the roads of Frenchman's Bend during the Civil War.</p>","Yes"
"20685","953","Unnamed Union Soldiers 18","Unnamed Union Soldiers 18","","<p>This is the ""United States military force"" referred to in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> that ""burned the Square and the business district"" in Jefferson during the Civil War (37).</p>","Yes"
"20684","952","Unnamed Union Soldiers 9","Unnamed Union Soldiers 9","","<p>The Union Army in <em>Absalom!</em> is an unseen but important force.  When ""Yankee troops"" pass near Yoknapatawpha at some point in the Civil War (66), for example, Coldfield's two Negro servants and ""all of Sutpen's"" slaves ""follow the Yankee troops away"" (67).</p>","Yes"
"20683","951","Unnamed Union Soldiers 11","Unnamed Union Soldiers 11","","<p>Two of the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories - ""The Unvanquished"" (titled ""Riposte in Tertio"" in the novel) and ""Vendee"" - refer generically to the Yankee troops <em>after</em> they have left Mississippi: ""there ain't a Yankee regiment left,"" says Ab Snopes in ""The Unvanquished"" (87, 139).  He is wrong, but by the next story they have in fact all moved away to continue fighting elsewhere in the South.  In ""Vendee,"" in their absence, Uncle Buck says Grumby's viciousness makes ""even the Yankees"" look good in comparison (105, 169).</p>","Yes"
"20682","498","Unnamed Union Cavalry 1","Unnamed Union Cavalry 1","","<p>In both <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and ""Retreat"" as a short story and again as a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, this company of Union cavalry rides up to the Sartoris plantation hoping to capture Colonel John Sartoris.  In all three texts he is able to fool them long enough to escape, but in the last two the Yankees then dig up the family's buried silver and set fire to the mansion.</p>","Yes"
"20681","497","Uncle Willy Christian","Christian, Uncle Willy","Hoke Christian","<p>""Uncle Willy"" is the title character in a 1935 short story.  His last name is Christian, his first name is probably William, and as the narrator says, ""he wasn't anybody's uncle"" (225). His story is briefly recapitulated in two later novels, <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>.  His story is very un-Faulknerian in its refusal to provide many details about Willy's past.  He was born in Jefferson soon after the end of the Civil War, the son of a man who opened a drugstore in town in the 1850s; Willy himself adds the fact that he ""graduated from a university"" (245).  He still owns the store, but keeps it mainly as a way to supply his own morphine addiction; the narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" either does not know how the sixty-year-old man became so estranged from adult life, or is satisfied with the reason he himself supplies for Willy's unconventional behavior: ""he had had fun all his life in spite of what they had tried to do to him"" (239).  The references to him in the later novels don't shed any additional light on his history, but from them it's clear that Willy remains a well-known part of Yoknapatawpha lore.  In addition to drugs, Willy finds his fun in alcohol and prostitutes and, ultimately, flying.  Willy seems to be summing up his life when, after asking the 'Christian' ladies of Jefferson who try to reform him to ""please go to hell,"" he says he wants to get there at his ""own gait"" (231). Readers have to decide for themselves how to view this man who is both child-like and willing to allow real children to help him inject morphine or steal alcohol, and whose death may be as much a suicide as an accident.</p>","Yes"
"20680","950","Uncle Job 1","Uncle Job 1","","<p>The ""Uncle Job"" in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> works at the hardware store where Jason Compson also works.  In one of his racist rants, Jason calls him ""an old doddering nigger"" (251), but while Jason also complains about Job's laziness, during the course of the day April 6, 1928, he is shown assembling new cultivators and delivering merchandise.  Earl, the man both Job and Jason work for, says ""I can depend on him"" (248).</p>","Yes"
"20679","496","Uncle Job 2","Uncle Job 2","","<p>Called ""Uncle Job"" in ""Smoke"" and ""Old Man Job"" in <em>The Town</em>, he is the elderly Negro janitor and factotum to Judge Dukinfield.</p>","Yes"
"20678","495","Uncle Dick Bolivar","Bolivar, Uncle Dick","","<p>""Uncle Dick"" is white, so the honorific ""Uncle"" in his case has a different connotation than it does for the Negro 'uncles' in Yoknapatawpha.  In ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard,"" and again in <em>The Hamlet</em>, where the story of hidden treasure at the Old Frenchman's place is re-told, he is ""a shriveled little old man . . . with a long white beard"" (144, 379). He wears ""a filthy frock coat,"" lives in ""a mud-daubed hut"" in a swamp, and is reputed to eat ""frogs and snakes [and] bugs as well"" (144, 381). He ""cares nothing about money"" (146, 384), but makes a living of some kind making and selling ""nostrums and charms"" (144, 381). Suratt hires him to dowse the garden at the Old Frenchman's place, which he does successfully using a spent cartridge containing a ""gold-filled human tooth"" dangling from ""forked peach branch"" (145, 381). He is obviously a kind of conjuror or medicine man, but his speech is full of references to ""the Lord.""</p>","Yes"
"20677","494","Uncle Ash","Ash, Uncle","","<p>Ash, or Uncle Ash, is an old Negro who works for Major de Spain.  In the five fictions in which he appears, he is most often seen in the woods, as the cook and chief servant on the Major's annual hunting trips, ""a-helping around camp,"" as Ratliff puts it in ""A Bear Hunt,"" where Ash first appears (67) - though in the last section of ""The Bear"" in the novel <em>Go Down, Moses</em> he sits in the corner of De Spain's office in Jefferson, pulling the cord on the ""bamboo-and-paper punkah"" that provides the Major with a breeze in the heat of Mississippi (301).  That suggests the menial place in which his character is usually confined, even in the big woods, but there are two exceptions to this.  Also in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> Ash provides a kind of minstrel comedy when he tries hunting himself with Boon's gun and four shells he's collected over the years, including one that ""Genl Cawmpson guv me"" eight years earlier (308).  The first story in which he appears is a comedy too, but in it Ash reveals himself to be observant and smart, and perfectly capable of arranging a sly act of revenge against a white man, Luke Provine, for his demeaning, racist treatment of Ash many years before.  (In the first publication of ""A Bear Hunt"" - in <em>The Saturday Evening Post</em> - his name is Old Man Bush; in his last appearance, in <em>The Big Woods</em>, he is Ash Wylie; and in ""Lion,"" the man who cooks for De Spain in the woods is named ""Ad."")</p>","Yes"

"20673","947","Minnie Sue Turpin","Turpin, Minnie Sue","Turpin 1","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Minnie Sue is a young woman in Frenchman's Bend whom Byron Snopes has courted in the past, and whom he ""paws"" in a sordid attempt at sex on his flight from town after robbing the bank (281).

"20672","946","Turpin 3","Turpin 3","","<p>This is the younger of the two Turpins mentioned in <em>The Mansion</em>.  Like the older one, he is associated with Frenchman's Bend, where he lives in the hill country.  Gavin Stevens recalls that he failed to ""answer his draft call"" during World War II (459).  He is presumably related to the older Turpin, and perhaps to the Turpin family that appears in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, but the novel does not say how.</p>","Yes"

"20670","490","Trumbull","Trumbull","","<p>Trumbull first appears in <em>The Hamlet</em> as the man who has been the blacksmith of Frenchman's Bend for ""almost twenty years"" (69).  An elderly man who is ""hale, morose and efficient,"" his character ""invites no curiosity"" until he is displaced by two of Flem Snopes' cousins, I.O. and Eck (73).

He does not explicitly say they are Chickasaws, the Indians who inhabit Yoknapatawpha in most of Faulkner's references to the indigenous population, but that they are part of the Chickasaw nation can be inferred from his reference to David Colbert as ""the chief Man of all the Chickasaws in our section"" (365).

The People always eagerly await the arrival of the steamboat up the river, and lament its departure, but their main role in the story is as spectators to the competition between Ikkemotubbe and David Hogganbeck; they do not seem to take sides, even though one of the competitors is a white man.  On the other hand, Ikkemotubbe may be using the phrase to refer to Indians in general, as a racial and ethnic group distinct from the white people who live in ""America"" (361), when he says: ""But white men and the People fight differently"" (371).</p>","Yes"

The barn suggests he is  farmer, but when his section begins he is sitting with a group of men at ""the store"" (112), which may mean he also owns a country store.  The reference to ""Samson's"" in the second novel - according to Lena Grove ""that somebody down at Samson's told her there is a fellow named Burch or something working at the planing mill in Jefferson"" (16) - more clearly implies a store.

For example, Gavin Stevens and his nephew, the narrator, divide them generationally: Gavin refers to ""the ones of my age and generation"" (133), and the narrator, to ""the ones of my age and time"" (134). In either case, however, the ""people"" evoked are white.  Although it is about Southern racism, the story takes for granted the South's exclusion of blacks from the electoral process and its own focus on the white people of Yoknapatawpha, especially as voters, the people who, in a democracy, have the power to create their government. The story does not bring any of these voters into focus as a person, not even when ""they"" are given lines to speak (135), but as a group, the people who for twenty-five years keep electing Clarence Snopes to represent them in state government are portrayed as either thoughtless (""sheep,"" 134), naive (""innocents,"" 131) or racist. Their inadequacies as guardians of the common weal crosses sectional and gender and class lines. The good people of Jefferson - ""schoolteachers, young professional people, women"" (131) - are as easily manipulated by Snopes as ""the mass of country voters"" (132). The narrator does create a ""few"" exceptions (131), the ""few of us, only a handful"" who recognize the threat Snopes poses to society and hope to defeat him (132); after Devries begins campaigning against Snopes, the narrator refers to the people who support him as ""the ex-soldiers, the liberals, the innocents, the women"" (136).

"20636","927","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 9","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 9","","<p>In ""By the People"" the ""People"" of Yoknapatawpha are organized around several different points of reference.  This entry refers to a group defined at the start of the story around the character of Ratliff: the ones who buy what he's selling as a salesman and the ones who enjoy listening to him as a raconteur.  We could call these the (white) people of Yoknapatawpha as consumers.  This group is subdivided by location and gender.  As a salesman he demonstrates sewing machines and compact organs for ""ladies"" who, when they live in the county's rural areas, sit ""in a circle of chairs outside""  or, in town, sit in a ""parlor"" decorated with ""antimacassars"" and ""wax flowers"" (86).  As a ""man among men"" he is equally at home talking with ""squatting, whittling"" men sitting in front of a country store or with professionals and other salesman ""gathered along the banquette of the hotel"" (86).  Ratliff's ability to appeal to these people, across the various divisions of class and gender, is presented as a virtue.  (When the narrative's focus shift to Senator Snopes and politics, popularity with the people, presumably the same people, seems like a vice.)</p>","Yes"
"20634","925","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 1","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 1","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> the inhabitants of Yoknapatawpha appear in town in various ways. The opening pages of Part Three provide a fairly detailed inventory of the various generational and class and racial groupings into which the population is organized, at least by Faulkner's imagination: ""dawdling negro boys,"" ""old men bound townward,"" ""drifting negroes,"" ""country people,"" ""urbanites,"" ""men in titled chairs before certain stores,"" still older men wearing their Confederate uniforms ""beneath the porticoes of the courthouse,"" ""young men"" pitching dollars, ""young girls in their little colored dresses,"" more Negroes who ""lounge"" and more ""countrymen in overalls"" who ""squat"" (161-62).</p>","Yes"
"20633","924","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 4","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 4","","<p>The group from the county that attends Granny's funeral in both ""Vendee"" and <em>The Unvanquished</em> consists of both blacks and whites.  The whites are ""hill people"" as opposed to townspeople; the ""hill men with crockersacks tied over their heads"" to shelter them from the rain are contrasted with the ""town men with umbrellas"" (98, 156).   In a passage added to the novel, most of the blacks are described as having returned to Yoknapatawpha after following the Union Army to seek freedom (155).   Despite their poverty, or perhaps because of it, Bayard's narrative in both texts treats these folk with more sympathy than the better-dressed people from town, and he admires their willingness to give back the mules Granny got for them in order to help him and Ringo in the quest to avenge her death. Bayard notes that from these people ""we could have raised a cavalry regiment"" for that purpose: ""with cotton bagging and flour sacking for uniforms and hoes and axes for arms"" (102, 164).</p>","Yes"

"20631","923","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 1","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 1","","<p>Although ""the townspeople"" as an entity plays a smaller role in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> than in many other Yoknapatawpha texts, occasionally the narrative does indicate their presence.  This is the most true in Jason's section, which is not surprising given his concern with his family's reputation and place in the eyes of those townspeople.  Among the groups he mentions or refers to are the men who apparently gathered in Jefferson the previous Christmas to shoot pigeons who were roosting in and fouling the clocks in the courthouse (247).</p>","Yes"

"20629","921","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 12","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 12","","<p><em>The Mansion</em> represents the inhabitants of Yoknapatawpha as a group in various passages.  According to the text, for example, ""not just the town but the county came too"" to Flem Snopes's funeral (461).  In these references readers get some idea of the average living conditions for Faulkner's rural characters.  For example, the narrative compares the modern and lavish conditions at the renovated Bacchus plantation - ""electric light and steam heat and running water"" - with the living conditions for ""a lot of the rest of us,"" who ""still depended on coal oil lamps for light and our wives to tote firewood and water from the nearest woodlot and spring or well"" (218).  But <em>The Mansion</em> covers a long span of time, half of the 20th century, and includes several indications of what would conventionally be called progress, such as the ""small electric-driven corn-mill"" that appears two hundred pages later in the novel (407).  The novel's representation of this rural population depends on a point of view that shifts between narrators and even characters.  Mink Snopes, for example, is very skeptical about the spirituality of the Christians in Frenchman's Bend who regularly go to church; to him, the women go ""to swap a mess of fried chicken,"" their husbands go because they don't trust either the preacher or their wives together, while ""the young folks"" are looking for ways ""to be the first couple behind the nearest handy thicket-bush"" (6).  The account in Chapter 13 of Clarence Snopes' political success casts a dark shadow over the idea that democracy is the best form of government, and explicitly exposes and condemns white Southern racism.  Gavin Stevens, however, is on friendly social terms with ""the country men who had elected him to his office"" (429), and as an itinerant salesman V.K.

"20628","920","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 5","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 5","","<p>Throughout <em>The Hamlet</em>, Faulkner frequently focalizes the narrative through the collective third-person ""the people"" in much the same way he uses ""we"" in ""A Rose for Emily."" The people of Yoknapatawpha's ""countryside"" are described as a self-organizing social body, which can be compared to a ""swarm of bees"" (128), a ""hive"" or ""a cloud of pink-and-white bees"" (349).</p>","Yes"
"20627","919","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 8","Unnamed People of Yoknapatawpha 8","","<p>Elements of the (white) population of Yoknapatawpha are referred to in several ways in ""Knight's Gambit.""  Their most pervasive role is as a kind of audience: ""the county watches"" the actions of the main characters unfold ""as the subscribers [to a magazine] read and wait and watch for the serial's next installment"" (149).  For example, the people whom Gavin Stevens calls ""the Yoknapatawpha County spinster aunts of both sexes"" share gossip and speculations about an unknown man who may have courted Mrs. Harris before her marriage to Mr. Harriss (151) and watch ""by hearsay and supposition"" as Mr. Harriss transforms his wife's home into a kind of show palace (161). Similarly, ""the ladies of Yoknapatawpha County"" evaluate the people who are hired to tutor the Harriss children as ""the best of company"" (145).  The ""neighbors"" of Mrs. Harriss' father are part of this larger group (241), and when the U.S. enters the Second World War, this group becomes the ""civilians"" who need time to ""get used to war"" and men in uniforms (255).

This generic group and the Compsons seem to have an estranged, at times even antagonistic relationship to each other.  The ""town and county"" expect that the descendants of Governor Compson will ""fail at everything"" they touch (329), and as he sits alone in his office on the Square, Jason III composes ""caustic and satiric eulogies"" on his ""fellowtownsmen"" (330).</p>","Yes"

In almost every instance it seems fair to say that the ""townspeople"" he uses this way are implicitly the <em>white</em> people, but it seems more accurate to create a separate ""Character=Jefferson Townspeople"" for each text in which the device occurs.  Various anonymous groups bear witness to the events of <em>The Mansion</em>.  The most explicit description of them occurs during a discussion of the communist political ideas brought into Jefferson by two Finnish immigrants and, after her experiences in Greenwich Village and the Spanish Civil War, Linda Snopes Kohl.  According to Charles Mallison the ""white male Jeffersons"" of every class - ""the operators of Saturday curb-side peanut- and popcorn-vending machines . . . the side street and back alley grocers . . . the department store owners and automobile and gasoline agencies"" - shared ""one concert of unanimity"" in opposition to communism and in defense of racial segregation (237-38).  In Chapter 13, however, in the account of Clarence Snopes' political career, the narrative suggests that some of the town's population - ""school-teachers, young professional people, women"" - believe in ""decency and right and personal liberty"" and oppose the racism of an organization like the Ku Klux Klan (332).</p>","Yes"
"20620","914","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 19","Unnamed Jefferson Townspeople 19","","<p>""When I say 'we' and 'we thought,'"" Charles says on the first page of <em>The Town</em>, ""what I mean is Jefferson and what Jefferson thought"" (3).  This entry represents the ""town,"" the people of Jefferson as a group, in that larger role - as spectators, commentators and interpreters - at various points in the narrative.  As a group, they often preserve the history of Yoknapatawpha; Gavin, for instance, mentions the men who were still alive in his childhood who before the Civil War ""had actually seen"" the steamboat that Ikkemotubbe, one of the Chickasaw chiefs, lived in as his 'big house' (331).  Occasionally these folks also take a more active role in the story, as when ""plenty"" of the people who had watched Mrs. Hait's house burn down seek out I.O. Snopes in the Square to ""keep him posted"" (252).  But their typical role is to serve as witnesses to what happens during the novel's present: before the board of aldermen meets to try to settle Gavin's official complaint against Mayor de Spain, for example, these ""folks coming up the streets and gathering in the Square, [are] laughing and making jokes back and forth"" (89).  The novel's three narrators repeatedly refer to this anonymous group.  ""More people than you would have thought"" send flowers to Eck Snopes' funeral (117); a large group attends Eula's funeral in person, ""The women inside and the men standing around the little front yard and along the street, all neat and clean and wearing coats and not quite looking at each other while they talked quietly about crops and weather"" (360).  ""The whole county"" seems to be in the Square to watch Matt Levitt drive away (208); similarly at the end of the novel ""a considerable crowd"" gathers at the train station to watch the four children of Byron Snopes depart Jefferson (389).  A variety of people view the confrontations between Mrs. Hait, I.O. Snopes, and his mules : ""the ladies in the peignors and boudoir caps of morning, the children playing in the yards, and the people Negro and white who happened to be passing at the moment"" (247).  Most of the references to this group implies that ""Jefferson"" is white, but as this last example shows, the local audience for the novel's events can include the Negro population.  While the narrators assume this group always thinks or feels the same way, on at least one occasion town opinion is split: Jeffersonians disagree over how to dispose of the Eula Snopes-Manfred de Spain affair: ""Two camps: the one that said the sin must be exposed now, it had already lasted eighteen years too long; the other which said it dare not be exposed now and so reveal our own baseness in helping to keep it hidden all this long time""; and even these two camps, says Chick Mallison, are ""split in turn into what you might call a hundred individual nonconforming bivouacs"" (322).</p>","Yes"

This collective group of (white) people of Jefferson, referred to as ""the town,"" plays a number of roles in <em>Light in August</em>, from watching the stories of Joe and Joanna and Hightower unfold to helping to tell them.   As a kind of character, this group can be seen on Sunday mornings walking decorously to church ""beneath parasols, carrying bibles and prayerbooks"" (297), but we also see them telling Byron the sordid story of Hightower's marriage, and flocking to the jail or the courthouse to witness Christmas' arrest or trial.  From their ""ancestors"" the current people of ""the town"" seem to have inherited strong critical opinions about strangers, outsiders, or any resident of Jefferson suspected of unconventional behavior. When Faulkner refers to the town, he sometimes intends for us to understand that the whole of white Jefferson shares a common opinion and judgment on a particular matter (e.g., shunning Joanna Burden because of her racial attitudes, family history, and present behavior). At other times, he divides the Jefferson townsfolk by class, gender, age, or profession (e.g., according to whether they know that Christmas and Brown sell bootleg whisky). At still other times, he shows segments of the town or the townspeople to be in disagreement (e.g., according to whether they wish to protect or prosecute the men who beat up Hightower). Faulkner does not present the opinion or judgment of black Jefferson under the name of townspeople; he almost invariably presents this material through individual characters, such as the boy that first directs Christmas to the Burden Place (227).</p>","Yes"

"20579","470","Unnamed Sister of Rosa Millard","Unnamed  Sister of Rosa Millard","","<p>Readers meet Granny's sister Louisa Hawk, who lives in Alabama, but both ""Retreat"" and <em>The Unvanquished</em> refer to another sister, who is neither named nor described but only mentioned: Granny explains the trip she's taking by saying that ""My sister lives in Memphis, we are going there"" (24, 56).  Since ""Millard"" is Granny's married name, we have no way of knowing the name of her sister; however, she may be the mother of Cousin Melisandre who appears in ""My Grandmother Millard and General Bedford Forrest and the Battle of Harrykin Creek.""</p>","No"
"20578","469","Unnamed Aunt of Rider","Unnamed Aunt of Rider","","<p>This deeply devout and caring woman is a constant presence both in Rider's life and the story ""Pantaloon in Black"" in both its publications, as a short story and as a chapter in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>: ""She was his aunt.  She had raised him.  He could not remember his parents at all"" (238, 130).  Several other characters, including her husband and members of Rider's mill gang, are referred to as her messengers, as she makes repeated efforts to rein in Rider's self-destructive bent by encouraging him to turn to family and to religion.</p>","Yes"
"20577","468","Rider","Rider","Unnamed Parents of Rider","<p>Rider, the protagonist of ""Pantaloon in Black"" as both a short story and a chapter in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, is one of Faulkner's most memorable black characters.  We never learn his real name; ""Rider"" is a nickname, given to him by ""the men he worked with and the bright dark nameless women he had taken""  before he became the devoted husband of Mannie (249, 144).  He is depicted from two different perspectives in both texts.  Each perspective - that of the third-person narrator and then that of the white deputy sheriff who tries to tell his wife about Rider after he is lynched - describe him as powerful, even superhuman in his strength, ""better than six feet and weighing better than two hundred pounds"" (129, 238).  At 24 he is the head of a sawmill work gang, and he rents a cabin on the Carothers-Edmonds place which for the last six months he has shared with his new wife.  But each narrative represents his overwhelming grief at Mannie's death very differently.  To the racist deputy, Rider's behavior proves that he  seems lacks  ""the normal human feelings and sentiments of human beings"" (147).  But in the main narrative, readers see a profoundly emotional man who, as he himself says in the last line we hear him speak, ""just can't quit thinking"" (255) - which is the same problem that haunts Faulkner's aristocratic white males like Quentin Compson.  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> Temple Drake Stevens describes his grief and despair and the way he ""cuts a white man's throat with a razor in a dice game"" (156), but her brief re-telling of his story does not mention the lynching.</p>","Yes"
"20576","724","Whitfield 2","Whitfield 2","","<p>""Whitfield's cabin"" is the first ""church"" in Yoknapatawpha (213, 23), and presumably the Whitfield who lives there is an ancestor of the ""Reverend Whitfield"" who is an important character in <em>As I Lay Dying</em> and also appears in several other fictions.   Although this original Whitfield is only mentioned in ""A Name for the City"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, it seems safe to say that he is not a full-time preacher, but a settler who holds lay services in his cabin.</p>","Yes"
"20575","467","Reverend Whitfield","Whitfield, Reverend","","<p>Reverend Whitfield is the local preacher in Frenchman's Bend, and in four of the fictions set there.  His character varies dramatically across those texts.  He appears first in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, in the part of a minister who has had an unconfessed affair with a married woman and is the father of an illegitimate child; many readers are reminded of Hawthorne's Dimmesdale, Hester and Pearl, not least because Addie Bundren, Whitfield's lover, names her son Jewel.  In the section of that novel he narrates he reveals himself to be a self-righteousness hypocrite, happy to confuse his own moral cowardice with the will of God.  He next appears, less dramatically, in <em>The Hamlet</em>, where the third person narrator describes him as a ""farmer and a father; a harsh, stupid, honest, superstitious and upright man, out of no seminary, holder of no degrees, functioning neither within nor without any synod but years ago ordained minister by Will Varner"" (223).  His role in ""Tomorrow"" is functional - to preside over a wedding and a funeral - which he does competently within a single 18-word phrase (105).  His last appearance, as the pastor of the church that Grier accidentally burns down in ""Shingles for the Lord,"" is his most impressive one.  He appears to the boy narrator as a man whose significance to the poor white community remains standing amid the ashes of a building: ""Whitfield like always in his boiled shirt and his black hat and pants, standing there with his hat on, too, like he had strove too long to save what hadn't ought to been created in the first place . . . to need to take his hat off in any presence"" (40-41).  Maybe, says the narrator, ""there was something that even that fire hadn't even touched"" (42).  In <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> Faulkner locates a ""Whitfield"" among the very earliest white settlers in Jefferson; he is almost certainly intended as an ancestor of this latter day Whitfield.</p>","Yes"
"20574","465","Redlaw|Redmond","Redlaw|Redmond","","<p>Named Redlaw in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and Redmond in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, this man was Colonel Sartoris' partner in building the railroad through Yoknapatawpha until the two men fell out; after Sartoris defeated him in an election, Redlaw shot and killed him. His name changes to ""Ben Redmond"" in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, where he also plays a larger role.  The second novel adds the detail that he did not fight in the Civil War, one of the things Sartoris taunts him about during the political campaign - though many people in Jefferson know that ""he aint no coward"" (226).  When he re-appears in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, again as Redmond, his life story has changed: in this last appearance he is identified as one of the ""carpetbaggers in Jefferson"" at the end of the Civil War (183) - i.e. a Yankee - before becoming Sartoris' partner.</p>","Yes"
"20573","464","Reba Rivers","Rivers, Reba","","<p>""Miss Reba"" Rivers - whom Temple in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> calls ""the madam of [a] cat house"" in Memphis (111) - appears by name in <em>Sanctuary</em>, <em>The Mansion</em> and <em>The Reivers</em>.  She is a colorful character: fat, asthmatic, church-going and hard-drinking, with some pretensions to gentility but no illusions about life.  When readers first meet her she is carrying a ""rosary"" in one hand and a ""tankard"" of beer in the other (144).  In <em>Sanctuary</em> the great love of her life, someone named Mr. Binford, has died, and in tribute to the 11 years they lived together ""like two doves"" she has named her two dogs Mr. Binford and Miss Reba (255).  In her final appearance, in <em>The Reivers</em>, she is twenty years younger, and much warmer.  Lucius describes her at first as ""a young woman . . . with a kind hard handsome face and hair that was too red"" (96).  Mr. Binford is still alive; she is hard on him, or at least on his failings, and also a hard drinker, and knows how to exert her authority as a prominent and wealthy woman among the powerful men of Memphis who are also her customers, but in this story she uses that power selflessly.  When Mink Snopes describes her in <em>The Mansion</em>, he facetiously describes her appearance as ""motherly,"" ""weighing two hundred pounds in a wrapper fasted with safety pins"" (80); on Saturday nights she wears ""her big yellow diamonds"" and an ""evening gown"" (83).</p>","No"
"20572","463","V.K. Suratt|Ratliff","Suratt|Ratliff, V.K.","Ratliff, Father of V.K.","<p>This is one of Faulkner's favorite characters.  He appears under two different last names, first as V.K. Suratt (in his first four appearances, in texts published through early 1932), then - apparently after someone named 'Suratt' complained to Faulkner - as V.K. Ratliff in six more texts, beginning in early 1934.  Under either name he is an itinerant sewing machine salesman who travels throughout Yoknapatawpha at first on a  wagon drawn by a sturdy mismatched team of horses, and then in a small, specially outfitted truck.  He is always gregarious, carrying the local news to and from groups of men and women across several counties.  Although he himself notes in <em>The Mansion</em> that his own childhood ""come out of that same similar Frenchman's Bend background and millyew that Flem Snopes had lifted his-self out of"" (154), over time he emerges as an implacable foe of 'Snopesism.'  In <em>The Hamlet</em>, however, he is bested by Flem in a scam that enables the Snopeses to start moving into Jefferson; that is the one time his actions seem motivated by greed, rather than curiosity and a kind of altruism that has the best interests of the people of Yoknapatawpha at heart.  Altogether he appears in ten texts, and in many of them (including the second two volumes of the Snopes trilogy) Faulkner uses him as a first-person narrator and also as a story teller whose vernacular voice is often as eloquent as Faulkner's high modernist style, as when near the end of <em>The Town</em> it registers the tragedy of Eula Varner's fate as Flem's wife.  It is Eula to whom he confides what those two initials in his name stand for.</p>","Yes"
"20571","885","Vladimir Kyrilytch Ratcliffe I","Ratcliffe, Vladimir Kyrilytch I","","<p>In <em>The Town</em>, this is the first member of the Ratcliffe|Ratliff family in the U.S.  Eula Snopes calls him V.K. Ratliff's ""six or eight or ten times grandfather""(338) - but that's exaggerated.  Originally from Russia, he arrives in the new world during the Revolution as an ensign in the British army.  After being captured, he escapes and is rescued by ""a woman of course, a girl, that hid him and fed him"" (338).  He marries and takes the last name of the woman who saved him: Nelly Ratcliffe.  After the Revolution he becomes ""a Virginia farmer"" (338).   His name and patronymic - ""Vladimir Kyrilytch"" - become traditional for successive generations of males in the family, though over time his last name morphs int o ""Ratliff.""  The V.K. Ratliff, who appears in 10 fictions as one of Faulkner's favorite characters (in the first two as V.K. Suratt) hides the family's foreign origins by using only those two initials - but his name, as he admitted to Eula, is Vladimir Kyrilytch too.  His story is retold in <em>The Mansion</em>.</p>","No"
"20570","884","V.K. Ratcliffe II","Ratcliffe, V.K. II","Vladimir Kyrilytch Ratcliffe I","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> this is the member of the Ratcliffe|Ratliff family who gets as far west as Tennessee.</p>","No"
"20569","462","V.K. Ratcliffe III","Ratcliffe III, V.K.","","<p>This man, the grandson of a Russian immigrant, is the first Yoknapatawphan member of the family that culminates in the V.K. Ratliff who appears in ten fictions.  He arrives early enough in the county's history to be one of the men who ""started Jefferson,"" as <em>The Town</em> puts it (338).  He appears fairly late in the Faulkner's career, first appearing in ""A Name for the City"" and again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> as the nascent settlement's  ""post trader"" - i.e. the person in charge of the Indian agency's trading post (206). In these two texts he works with men named Peabody and Compson to bring about the naming of Jefferson.  In all three of these works his name is two letters longer than the last member of the family; <em>The Town</em> explains that over time his descendants ""forgot how to spell it Ratcliffe and just spelled it like it sounds"" - i.e. Ratliff (338).  When he is mentioned in <em>The Mansion</em>, however, the narrative says his name is already ""Ratliff"" when he first arrives in Yoknapatawpha (184).  It seems Faulkner too forgot how to spell it Ratcliffe.</p>","Yes"
"20568","461","General Pickett","Pickett, General George","","<p>Born into an old Virginia family, General George Pickett was 38 years old when, as a division commander in Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, he led the disastrous charge on the last day of the battle of Gettysburg in which thousands of Confederate soldiers were killed or wounded.  In <em>Absalom!</em> the Canadian Shreve gets the battle wrong, and is quickly corrected by Quentin (289).  According to Gavin Stevens in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, ""every Southern boy"" can conjure up the moment before the charge began and it still was possible for the South to win the war (190).  The ""Pickett"" Gavin evokes is a romantic figure, ""with his long oiled ringlets"" and his sword (190).</p>","No"
"20567","456","Pat Stamper","Stamper, Pat","","<p>The legendary  Pat Stamper, master of ""the science and pastime of horse trading in Yoknapatawph county,"" makes a fool of Pap, who tries to trade with him in ""Fool about a Horse,"" and of Ab Snopes, when that story is revised and interpolated into <em>The Hamlet</em>.  With the help of his Negro hostler, he can even get not only the better of each trade but ""actual Yoknapatawpha County cash dollars"" - as it's put in the novel (37) - out of the farmers who try to take him on.  When he is mentioned again in <em>The Mansion</em>, the territory he is master of has dramatically expanded and now includes ""the horse and mule circles not just in Yoknapatawpha County or north Mississippi but . . . most of Alabama and Tennessee and Arkansas too"" (202).</p>","Yes"
"20566","883","Pap 2","Pap 2","","<p>In ""Fool about a Horse,"" Pap is a tenant farmer who has little interest in growing the corn and cotton he is supposed to be cultivating on the land he rents in Frenchman's Bend.  Instead, he fancies himself a talented and successful horse- and mule- trader,  but as his son explains,""he never owned nothing that anybody would swap even a sorry horse for and even to him"" (119).  His attempt to best Pat Stamper, the acknowledged champion horse-trader of the Yoknapatawpha region, ends disastrously, but Pap himself seems blissfully unaware of his ineptitude.  (When Faulkner wrote <em>The Hamlet</em>, he interpolated a version of this story into the narrative; there he turns ""Pap"" into Ab Snopes, the father of Flem.)</p>","Yes"
"20565","455","Pap 1","Pap 1","","<p>""Blind and deaf,"" with eyes that ""look like two clots of phlegm"" and apparently voiceless and toothless as well (12), Pap is one of the most grotesque characters in Faulkner's fiction.  Lee and Ruby make sure he gets fed, but despite his name, <em>Sanctuary</em> gives no hint about ""who he was kin to,"" as Horace puts it (110), or how he came to be at the Old Frenchman place.  Horace facetiously speculates that he may have been there as long as the house itself.  In his grotesqueness he does fit the Gothic atmosphere of the place.</p>","Yes"
"20564","454","Oscar","Oscar","","<p>In ""Gold Is Not Always"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Oscar works for Roth Edmonds as a stableman, and along with Dan, the head stableman on the McCaslin-Edmonds place, he helps Edmonds search for the missing mule.  Like Dan, he recognizes the human as well as the animal footprints they are following; the fact that Edmonds doesn't ""realise"" until ""later"" that ""both the negroes"" withheld the name of the man, another Negro, subtly calls attention to the racial dynamics in play in Faulkner's world (229, 81).</p>","Yes"
"20563","453","Old Het","Old Het","","<p>The black woman who serves in ""Mule in the Yard"" and <em>The Town</em> as both partner in and witness to Mannie Hait's ongoing feud against mules and a man named I.O. Snopes remains a kind of enigma.  No one in the town knows how old she is: as the story puts it, ""she was about seventy probably, though by her own counting . . . she would have to be around a hundred"" (249).  Even at the younger age, she would have been born into slavery, though that story remains untold.  Het now lives in the county's poorhouse, from which she makes regular visits to town to receive food from various kitchens; her ""long rat-colored cloak trimmed with what forty or fifty years ago had been fur"" (249) reveals her impoverishment but also hints at a certain nobility of spirit that enables her to enjoy watching the feud.  In <em>The Town</em>'s telling of that, Het is more explicitly the source of much of the narrative.  ""Old Het said"" occurs over half a dozen times it (248, etc.).   Her voice, however, is relayed through  white voices.</p>","Yes"
"20562","451","Nub Gowrie","Gowrie, Nub","","<p>Nub Lowrie's appearance in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> is memorable.  His name - Nathan Bedford Forrest Gowrie - comes from a former slave-dealer who was also one of the Confederacy's most effective generals and a founder of the Ku Klux Klan; his nickname - ""Nub"" - combines the initials of his first names with the fact of his missing left arm.  How he became handicapped is not explained, but the loss doesn't diminish the force of his character.  He is ""a short lean old man with [pale] eyes . . . and a red weathered face""; his voice is ""high thin strong [and] uncracked"" (156).  He is also a ""fiery tyrant of a father"" to his six sons (160) whom most of Yoknapatawpha expects to waste no time lynching the Negro accused of killing his youngest.  When he finally comes face to face with him, Chick is surprised to see that this ""violent foulmouthed godless old man"" has a ""heart capable of breaking"" (158).  His later appearances are minor ones.  At least, we assume that the ""Mr. Gowrie"" (375) who sells a bottle of moonshine whiskey to Charles Mallison in <em>The Town</em> is the same man.  In <em>The Mansion</em>, Mink Snopes claims he sold his cow to ""one of the Gowrie boys up at Caledonia Chapel"" - the place where Chick meets him in <em>Intruder</em> (11).  Houston identifies the ""boy"" to whom Mink supposedly sold the cow as ""Nub"" (15), who is a moonshiner.</p>","Yes"
"20561","882","Myrtle 3","Myrtle 3","","<p>Miss Myrtle in <em>Sanctuary</em> is one of the two women who come back to the brothel with Miss Reba after the funeral for Red.  Myrtle is the ""short plump woman in a plumed hat"" who is accompanied by Uncle Bud, a ""boy of five or six"" (250).  She may be his mother, though her attempt to discipline him for drinking from their beers is half-hearted at best.  (The context suggests both she and Miss Lorraine might be madams at other Memphis brothels, but that is not made explicit in the text.)</p>","No"
"20560","881","Myrtle 2","Myrtle 2","","<p>The Myrtle in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> is the daughter of the sheriff and the wife of Vernon. The sheriff introduces Myrtle and Vernon to Jason when he comes to get the police to chase his niece.  (Chronologically it's possible that this is the same Myrtle who, younger, worked as a receptionist in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, but the novel provides no evidence for that connection.)</p>","Yes"
"20559","449","Myrtle 1","Myrtle 1","","<p>The Myrtle in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> is a ""young woman"" who works for Doctors Alford and Peabody as a receptionist.  In her exchanges with Miss Jenny, she is alternately a trained professional and a deferential southern girl.</p>","Yes"
"20558","880","Tubbs|Euphus Tubb","Tubbs|Tubb, Euphus","","<p>The jailer in the three novels set in mid-20th century Yoknapatawpha is a man named ""Tubbs"" in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, and ""Euphus Tubb"" in <em>The Mansion</em>.  In the first novel he is described as a ""snuffy untidy pot-bellied man with a harried concerned outraged face"" (51); although when Lucas Beauchamp is brought into his jail accused of killing a white man, he complains about having to risk his life ""protecting a goddamn stinking nigger"" ""for seventy-five dollars a month,"" he is nonetheless faithful to his ""oath of office"" (52).  In the second, he is one of the small cast that actually appears onstage in the dramatic portions of the text; as ""JAILOR,""  ""a typical small-town turnkey"" (206), he is talkative and deferential to the jail's visitors, but also and unintentionally insulting to visitors and prisoners alike. His racist and fundamentalist opinions are inextricably mixed with what he hopes to be courtesy.  In his final, minor appearance he is described as a man who ""spent most of his life being surprised"" (66).  (According to the ""Corrected Texts"" that Noel Polk edited for Vintage International, Faulkner spelled ""jailer"" with an 'e' in ""That Evening Sun,"" <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> and ""An Error in Chemistry"" but with an 'o' in ""Monk,"" <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> and <em>The Reivers</em>. ""Jailer"" is more standard in American usage, but when when we quote texts we follow their spelling.)</p>","Yes"
"20557","447","Mrs. Tubbs|Tubb","Tubbs|Tubb, Mrs.","","<p>In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, the wife of the county jailer is only mentioned when the jailer, a man named ""Tubbs,"" says ""I got a wife and two children"" (52).  She appears in both the prose and the dramatic sections of Act III in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, though she is only named when in the latter jailer Tubbs mentions ""Mrs Tubbs"" (208).  The prose section describes her as a woman ""engaged in something as intimate as cooking a meal"" (200).  In Yoknapatawpha, the jailer and his family lived in the jail, and it is in that domestic setting that, in <em>The Mansion</em>, the wife of jailer ""Tubb"" takes surprisingly personal care of Montgomery Ward Snopes while he is in the jail awaiting trial - surprising at least to the folks in town, because of Snopes' involvement with pornography, though Homer Bookwright offers an explanation when he notes that she is ""human too, even if she is a woman"" (70).</p>","Yes"
"20556","879","Mrs. Provine 1","Provine, Mrs. 1","","<p>According to the narrator of ""A Bear Hunt,"" Mrs. Luke Provine receives no financial support from her ne'er-do-well husband. It seems that she is the principal breadwinner in the family, with money she ""earned by sewing and such"" (64).</p>","Yes"
"20555","444","Mrs. Provine 2","Provine, Mrs. 2","","<p>The woman who is married to Wilbur Provine in <em>The Town</em> is mentioned during her husband's trial for making and selling illegal liquor.   Judge Long tells Provine, ""I'm going to send you to the penitentiary, not for making whiskey but for letting your wife carry water a mile and a half from that spring"" (178).</p>","Yes"
"20554","443","Mrs. Littlejohn","Littlejohn, Mrs.","","<p>The two-story Frenchman's Bend boarding house that Mrs. Littlejohn owns appears in five different texts.  She herself appears in three of them - ""Spotted Horses,"" <em>The Hamlet</em> and <em>The Town</em> - as a witness to the hapless efforts of ""them fool men,"" as she puts it in the first story, to buy the Texas ponies (174).  And she is not simply a spectator: when one of the horses invades her house, she breaks a washboard over its head.  She plays her largest role in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  Described there as a ""man-tall, man-grim woman"" wearing a ""faded wrapper"" (219), Mrs. Littlejohn provides kindness and various kinds of support for those whom she believes are deserving, such as the severely handicapped Ike Snopes or Mrs. Armstid (whose handicap is a foolish husband), and even the injured Henry Armstid.</p>","Yes"
"20553","442","Mrs. Killegrew","Killegrew, Mrs.","","<p>Mrs. Killegrew and her husband are neighbors of the Griers in ""Two Soldiers"" and ""Shingles for the Lord.""  In the second story she is described by the vernacular narrator as ""worser deaf than even Killegrew"" (28).  In the first story that disability explains why the Grier sons can go to the Killegrews' to find out what's going on in the world beyond Frenchman's Bend: because she is ""deaf"" (that is, presumably, very hard of hearing), her husband ""runs the radio as loud as it would run,"" and so the boys can ""hear it plain . . . even standing outside with the window closed"" (81).</p>","Yes"
"20552","441","Mrs. Holston","Holston, Mrs.","","<p>The name Holston is one of the oldest in Yoknapatawpha, but in both ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" and the reprinting of the story in <em>The Unvanquished</em> this character appears only as a name in the phrase ""Mrs. Holston's porter"" (71, 207).  He is a hotel porter, and presumably works at the Holston House, one of the oldest buildings in Jefferson.  As we know from other fictions, it was established by Alexander Holston; it seems to be owned now by this Mrs. Porter, who may be his daughter.</p>","Yes"
"20551","878","Gerald Bland","Bland, Gerald","Mrs. Bland 1","<p>The only son of Kentucky aristocrats, Gerald Bland is a Harvard University classmate of Quentin Compson.  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> they come to blows, violently but anti-climatically, when Quentin projects his rage against Caddy's suitors onto him.   In many ways Bland is Quentin's polar opposite, the Fortinbras to Quentin Compson's Hamlet-like character: Gerald is adored by his mother, an accomplished lady's man, athletic and decisive.   He makes another appearance in ""Ad Astra,"" the war story in which, after going to England as a Rhodes Scholar, he serves as an aviator in the Royal Flying Corps.  His appearance there is decidedly unheroic.</p>","No"
"20550","877","Mrs. Bland 2","Bland, Mrs. 2","","<p>The Mrs. Bland mentioned in ""Ad Astra"" probably doesn't exist.  Bland has apparently invented an imaginary wife for his own neurotic reasons.

"20545","435","Wilmoth","Wilmoth","","<p>In both the story ""Go Down, Moses,"" and the story as Faulkner published it in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Mr. Wilmoth is the editor the Jefferson newspaper.  He is described as ""an older man, though with hair less white than [Gavin] Stevens', in a black string tie and an old-fashioned boiled shirt and tremendously fat"" (259, 355).  Wilmoth is willing to help Stevens keep word of Samuel Beauchamp's execution from reaching Jefferson and also contributes a significant amount of money to bring back Beauchamp's body, saying that it's the first time ""I ever paid money for copy I had already promised beforehand I will not print"" (262, 360).</p>","Yes"

"20539","433","Maxey","Maxey","","<p>Maxey owns the town barber shop in both ""Hair"" (1931) and <em>Light in August</em> (1932).  He is a minor character in both texts, but plays a more central role in ""Hair,"" where the narrator relies on Maxey for information about the story's major characters.  (The Jefferson barber shop is a location in eight fictions.  It's possible that Faulkner imagined Maxey as its owner in one or more other stories.)</p>","Yes"

"20534","868","Mr. Gombault","Gombault, Mr.","","<p>In both ""The Tall Men"" and <em>The Town</em>, Gombault is a federal marshal in the district that includes Yoknapatawpha.  He is only mentioned in the later novel, but in the earlier story he plays a major role.  One of Faulkner's most palatable lawmen, Mr. Gombault is repeatedly described as old, yet he moves ""quickly, easily"" (61).  He displays a deep understanding of human behavior as he deals shrewdly with both Mr. Pearson and the McCallum family, and is perhaps one of the ""Tall Men"" of the story's title as the final line identifies him as a ""tall, lean old man"" (61).</p>","Yes"
"20533","430","Uncle Pete Gombault","Gombault, Uncle Pete","","<p>Called ""Mulberry"" as well as ""Uncle Pete,"" Gombault is ""a lean clean tobacco-chewing old man"" who was enslaved before the Civil War, and became a U.S. ""marshal"" during Reconstruction (190-91). A salesman of illegal whiskey before, during and after that appointment, as late as 1925 he was still ""fire-maker, sweeper, janitor and furnace-attendant to five or six lawyers and doctors and one of the banks"" (191-192). He is contemptuous of the various Federal agencies with abbreviated names that came into being in the 1930's, calling them ""XYZ and etc. . . ."" (190).  The title ""Uncle"" is a reflection of his status as a black man in a white supremacist culture.  The nickname ""Mulberry"" derives from his unofficial job as a bootlegger, and his life-long practice of hiding the illicit whiskey that he sold ""beneath the roots of a big mulberry tree"" (191).</p>","Yes"
"20532","867","Binford","Binford","","<p>This ""Binford"" (no first name) is one of the young men in Frenchman's Bend who are courting Eula Varner in <em>The Mansion</em>. He is probably related to the Dewitt Binford who marries one of Flem's sisters.

"20531","429","Mr. Binford","Binford, Mr.","","<p>Lucius Binford - or as he's called in two of the three novels in which he is mentioned or appears, Mr. Binford - is the business and romantic partner of Reba Rivers, the madame of a Memphis brothel.  In <em>The Mansion</em> he is referred to as a ""pimp"" (80).  In <em>The Reivers</em>, the one novel he actually appears in, Lucius Priest says his ""official"" title is ""landlord"" (110).  He is a little man, but there is something menancing about him; the first thing you notice about him, Lucius says, is ""his eyes . . . because the first thing you found out was that he was already looking at you"" (104).  He dresses like a gentleman, but calls the prostitutes who work for him and Reba ""bitches"" while claiming to teach them ""to act like ladies"" (107).  Lucius calls him ""the prince and paragon"" among ""landlords,"" and lists as his virtues his incorruptibility and fidelity to Reba, as his ""sole and only vice"" compulsively betting on horse races with Reba's money (111).  Readers of the earlier novel <em>Sanctuary</em> were introduced to him, posthumously, through Reba's grief and nostalgia.  In this novel she asks herself, ""Why the hell cant I do without him?"" (110).</p>","No"
"20530","428","Mr. Backus","Backus, Mr.","","<p>The father of Melisandre Backus Harriss Stevens appears in three fictions.  The description of him is remarkably the same in all three; here's the way it's worded in ""Knight's Gambit,"" the first of the three: he's a ""widower-owner who stayed at home and farmed his heritage"" while sitting ""through the long summer afternoons in a home-made chair on the front gallery, reading in Latin the Roman poets"" with ""a constant tumbler of thin whiskey-and-water at his elbow and the aged setter bitch dozing at his feet"" (150).  But while in that story he is favorably compared to the nouveau riche outsider who marries his daughter, the judgment of him varies in the other texts.  <em>The Town</em> calls him ""a good farmer"" (52), but in <em>The Mansion</em>, the last of the three, the same behavior means that he lets ""what used to be one of our biggest plantations"" fall into ""decay"" (217).</p>","Yes"
"20529","427","Buck Monaghan","Monaghan, Buck","Monaghan, Father of Buck","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> the man ""with an army pilot's wings on his breast""  drinking with Bayard in the Chicago nightclub flew with the Sartoris twins in the British air corps during World War I (384).  In the later short story ""Ad Astra,"" set at the front during that war, Monaghan describes himself as ""shanty Irish,"" because his late father made ""a million dollars digging sewers in the ground"" (414).  He is also a former student at Yale. Monaghan seems uncomfortable with his complex social status, and there is ""something of the crucified"" about him after three years of war (414).  When peace is declared, he removes his uniform insignia: ""I don't know what I am. I have been in this damn war for three years and all I know is, I'm not dead"" (415). He also appears in two non-Yoknapatawpha texts by Faulkner: the short story, ""Honor"" (1931)   and  <em>A Fable</em> (1954).</p>","No"
"20528","866","Harry Mitchell","Mitchell, Harry","","<p>Belle Mitchell's first husband Harry is described in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> as ""a cotton speculator and a good one; he was ugly as sin and kind-hearted and dogmatic and talkative"" (188). Conventional to a fault, Harry does not know his wife Belle is having an affair with Horace, whom he likes. After Belle divorces him, Young Bayard sees him in a Chicago nightclub with a young woman who is apparently trying to rob him.  In <em>Sanctuary</em>, where Belle is married to Horace Benbow, he is just referred to as ""a man named Mitchell"" (106).</p>","Yes"
"20527","425","Mitchell","Mitchell","","<p>In ""Hand upon Waters"" Ike tells Stevens that Lonnie Grinnup had saved his ""burying money"" with Mitchell ""at the store"" (73).  It's clear that the money is for his funeral expenses, but not clear who ""Mitchell"" is in this context.  He could be the store owner (though in all the other fictions where the Frenchman's Bend store occurs, it is owned by the Varners), or - as seems more likely - Mitchell is a local undertaker, whose clients put money away for him at the store, which thus functions as a kind of bank for the people who live outside the town.</p>","Yes"
"20526","423","Minnie","Minnie","","<p>The Negro maid who works in Miss Reba's Memphis brothel appears in four novels.  In <em>Sanctuary</em>, where she is named Minnie, she is a kind of confidant and guardian to Temple - either because Popeye pays her, or because she is afraid of him.  This role is made explicit in her next appearance, in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, where she is not named: Temple describes her as both her guard and the one person with whom she could ""talk"" (111-12).  She is given her name back in the scene at Reba's in <em>The Mansion</em>, where according to Mink Snopes she has to wear a hat at all times because her husband beat her with a flatiron and ""damn near tore her ear off with it"" (89).  She makes her final appearance, again as Minnie, in <em>The Reivers</em>.  Ned describes her color as ""high-brown"" (161). Lucius describes her in terms of her teeth: the ""richly alabaster matched and evenly serrated"" white ones that shine in ""the rich chocolate of her face,"" but especially the ""middle right-hand upper one"" that is a gold implant (97-98), and that somehow makes Reba's diamond earrings look small.  She has already been married ""twice"" (132).</p>","No"
"20525","865","Unnamed Men at Varner's Store 5","Unnamed Men at Varner's Store 5","","<p>Varner's store is a gathering place for the people who live in Frenchman's Bend.  In <em>The Town</em> there are two references to the groups of men, specifically, who are found there.  Gavin's hypothetical account of Mrs. Varner's visit to the store refers to the ""few loungers"" whom she chases out - these men ""should have been in the field,"" since it's ""planting time"" (307).  Later ""the men squatting along the gallery"" (388) - whom Ratliff also describes as a ""few neighbors"" (384) - rush off to rescue Clarence Snopes from Byron's children (388).</p>","Yes"

"20516","419","Matt Bowden","Bowden, Matt","","<p>Matt Bowden is described in both ""Vendee"" and <em>The Unvanquished</em> in the same words.  A criminal accomplice of Grumby whose name is not mentioned until after he himself has departed for Texas, Bowden is described with unusual detail.  His clothes - ""neat little fine made boots,"" ""linen shirt,"" and ""coat that had been good once, too"" (103, 166) - and even his ""small"" hands and feet (104, 168) suggest an upper class background.  When he first appears he is posing as a planter from Tennessee chasing Grumby himself.   His actions in the story, however, show him to be at least as ruthless and vicious as Grumby.  Though he is white, Bayard calls him ""the black man,"" presumably because of his ""ink-colored beard"" and ""light mat of fine black hair right down to the finger nails"" (104, 166).</p>","Yes"
"20515","418","Mason's Ruffians","Mason's Ruffians","","<p>Led by Samuel Ross Mason, a militia captain during the Revolutionary War, ""Mason's ruffians"" were a gang of river pirates and highwaymen who operated in the Mississippi Valley frontier in the late 18th century. Both the first-person narrator of ""A Name for the City"" and the omniscient third-person narrator of <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> reject the idea that the unnamed bandits who were briefly held in the settlement jail were part of this gang, because - as <em>Requiem</em> puts it -  ""even the last of Mason's ruffians were dead or scattered by this time"" (5).</p>","Yes"
"20514","860","De Spain's Daughters","De Spain, Daughters of De Spain","Manfred de Spain","<p>In ""A Bear Hunt,"" the married but unnamed and unenumerated daughters of Manfred de Spain occur to the unnamed narrator when he speculates they might have been given a sewing machine by Mrs. de Spain.  Manfred is usually depicted as a bachelor, but a son of his is mentioned in ""Shall Not Perish.""</p>","Yes"
"20513","439","Mrs. de Spain","De Spain, Mrs.","","<p>The wife of Major de Spain is mentioned in ""A Bear Hunt,"" when Ratliff wonders if she already owns a sewing machine - or may have given it to ""one of her married daughters"" (63).  These daughters are never mentioned again, but Mrs. de Spain herself appears briefly but vividly in ""Barn Burning"" when Ab Snopes tracks manure onto the expensive ""blond rug"" inside the front door of her mansion (12).  To Ab's son Sarty she is ""a lady,"" though the narrator's description also depicts her as a housewife: she wears ""an apron"" over her ""gown with lace at the throat,"" and though the De Spains have black servants, the fact that she is ""wiping cake or biscuit dough from her hands"" means she knows her own way to the kitchen (11-12).  There is nothing arrogant about the way, despite her ""incredulous amazement"" at finding Ab in her front hall, she asks him to ""please go away"" (12).  How much she has to do with her husband's determination to punish Ab for his act is never revealed in the story, though when Ratliff retells it in <em>The Hamlet</em> he ""reckons"" she and her indignation stand ""behind"" Major de Spain's treatment of Ab (17).  The Negro servant who opened the door in the short story calls her ""Miss Lula"" (11).  Ratliff calls her ""Miz de Spain"" (16).</p>","Yes"

"20511","417","Mary","Mary","","<p>The biblical mother of Jesus is mentioned in two fictions.  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Rev. Shegog mentions Mary in his Easter sermon, emphasizing her sufferings as a mother, ""de pangs"" of childbirth, her ""weeping en lamentation"" as she fears for the life of her newborn child and her grief at the scene of the crucifixion (296).  In ""Miss Zilphia Gant,"" she appears in Zilphia's fantasies as the mother who gave birth to a child miraculously: lying in bed, Zilphia whispers to herself that ""Mary did it without a man,"" and announces to the darkness that ""I will make myself conceive!"" (379).</p>","No"
"20510","416","Martha Habersham","Habersham, Martha","","<p>The Habersham family figures in Faulkner's fiction as one of the founders of Yoknapatawpha.  Martha Habersham figures in ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em> as the most determined among the Jefferson ladies who pressure Drusilla to behave like a woman.  Convinced that Drusilla and John Sartoris' relationship is sexual, Mrs. Habersham takes the lead in planning the wedding between them.  Her relationship to the other Habershams in the fictions is not explained.</p>","Yes"
"20509","415","Mannie","Mannie","","<p>In ""Pantaloon in Black"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Mannie has been married to Rider for half a year when her sudden death (of unspecified causes) becomes the traumatic loss, the powerful absence, that generates the story.  She is described as having a ""narrow back"" and ""narrow"" hand (241, 133).  Rider indicates that she is far slighter than her powerfully built husband, but her spirit is strong: ""You’s de onliest least thing whut ever kep up wid me one day, leff alone for weeks"" (241, 133).  She is present in the story in memories, traces of footprints in the road, the ""clean overalls which Mannie herself had washed only a week ago"" that Rider wears to her funeral (238, 129), and a brief, ghostly presence that Rider sees upon returning home after Mannie’s burial.  When Temple Drake Stevens re-tells this story, briefly, in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, both she and Rider are unnamed, and she dies ""only two weeks"" after marrying her husband (156).</p>","Yes"
"20508","414","Major de Spain","De Spain, Major","","<p>Two characters referred to as ""Major de Spain"" appear in fifteen different fictions.  Only one was a real Confederate ""Major"" during the Civil War; the other is his son, Manfred, who fought in the Spanish-American War as a Lieutenant but is called ""Major"" as a courtesy, and as a sign of the family's high status in Yoknapatawpha.  They never appear together, but in four texts - ""Shall Not Perish,"" <em>The Town</em>, <em>The Mansion</em> and <em>The Reivers</em> - both are referred to, and in those cases, it is easy to tell which ""De Spain"" Faulkner has in mind.  In several others cases, however, it is impossible to be sure.  And in other cases - ""Delta Autumn,"" ""The Bear"" - Faulkner's revisions of the first published version had the effect of changing the character from son to father.  Scholars often disagree about whether a particular De Spain is the father or the son, and some our choices can be second-guessed.  But according to those choices, Major de Spain the father appears or is mentioned in a dozen texts.  His experience in the Civil War is never described in any detail.  Instead, the focus of those texts is on his service as the county sheriff (""Wash,"" <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>), his behavior as a planter and landlord (""Barn Burning,"" <em>The Hamlet</em>), and especially his actions as a hunter in the big woods (""Lion,"" <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> and <em>The Reivers</em>).  It was this ""Major de Spain"" who bought the hunting cabin and hunting ground around it where the annual large game hunts take place from Thomas Sutpen.  In general the fictions make the Major's aristocratic class standing clear; for example, according to <em>The Reivers</em>, he ""culled and selected the men he considered worthy to hunt the game he decreed to be hunted"" (18-19).  His personality, however, remains less well-defined, except in his encounters with Ab and Sarty Snopes in ""Barn Burning"" and again in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  His son Manfred is much more vividly characterized.</p>","Yes"
"20507","413","Manfred de Spain","De Spain, Manfred","Major de Spain","<p>Two characters referred to as ""Major de Spain"" appear in fifteen different fictions.  Only one was a real Confederate ""Major"" during the Civil War; the other is his son, Manfred, who fought in the Spanish-American War as a Lieutenant but is called ""Major"" as a courtesy, and as a sign of the family's high status in Yoknapatawpha.  They never appear together, but in four texts - ""Shall Not Perish,"" <em>The Town</em>, <em>The Mansion</em> and <em>The Reivers</em> - both are referred to, and in those cases, it is easy to tell which ""De Spain"" Faulkner has in mind.  In several others cases, however, it is impossible to be sure.  And in other cases - ""Delta Autumn,"" ""The Bear"" - Faulkner's revisions of the first published version had the effect of changing the character from son to father.  Scholars often disagree about whether a particular De Spain is the father or the son, and some our choices can be second-guessed.  But according to those choices, Manfred de Spain appears in nine fictions.  He was born after the Civil War, probably around 1870.  Along with the honorary military title, he inherits his father's wealth and status, as well as the hunting camp where, also like his father, he leads annual hunting excursions.  But unlike his father, he is also a president of the Sartoris bank and a mayor of Jefferson.  In that office he is identified with a more modern sensibility: according to <em>The Town</em>, the sporty and noisy EMF Roadster he drives, one of the first cars in Jefferson, symbolizes his role as the ""champion, the Godfrey de Bouillon, the Tancred, the Jefferson Richard Lion-heart of the twentieth century"" (13).  A lifelong bachelor, he becomes a major figure in the Snopes trilogy because of the long-standing affair he carries on with Flem's wife Eula.  According to that novel and <em>The Mansion</em>, he leaves Jefferson in 1927 after Eula's suicide, but in ""Shall Not Perish"" he is still in town during World War Two, and in angry mourning for the death of his son in combat.</p>","Yes"
"20506","858","Ludus 2|Unnamed Husbands of Minnie","Ludus 2|Unnamed Husbands of Minnie","","<p>Minnie's former husband in <em>Sanctuary</em> - the first text in which she appears - is described as a ""cook in a restaurant"" who ""didn't approve of Minnie's business"" as a maid in a brothel, so he took everything he could from her and ""went off with a waitress in the restaurant"" (209-10).  Minnie sounds glad to be rid of him.  The husband referred to in <em>The Mansion</em> is named Ludus - and while he too steals Minnie's money, he also beats her savagely (89); although he's currently in prison, it's not clear that Minnie <em>is</em> rid of him.  In <em>The Reivers</em> we're told Minnie was married twice; if this cook is her first and Ludus her second husband, the inconsistencies between their characters would be resolved.  But none of the texts makes that clear.  Given this ambiguity, we use this one entry to represent 'Minnie's husband or husbands.'</p>","No"
"20505","1334","Ludus 1","Ludus 1","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em>, Ludus works as a driver for the livery stable, but is well known for his ""tomcatting"" - having affairs with local black women, single and married (13).  When he ""borry""s a team and wagon from the stable overnight to visit ""a new girl"" six miles out of town, he gets into trouble with Boon (10).</p>","Yes"
"20504","857","Miss Corrie","Corrie, Miss","Everbe Corrinthia I","<p>A major character in <em>The Reivers</em>.  ""Miss Corrie,"" as she is called when Lucius first meets her (99) - or ""Everbe,"" as he calls her after learning later in the narrative that her given names are ""Everbe Corinthia""  (153) - was born in Kiblett, Arkansas.  After her mother's death, her foster-mother put her to work as a prostitute ""as soon as she was big enough"" (154).  She is, Lucius notes when he first meets her at Miss Reba's, ""a big girl,"" ""still a girl, young too, with dark hair and blue eyes and at first I thought her face was plain"" (99).  Over the course of the story Lucius learns to appreciate both the beauty of her face and of her character.  Despite her past, she preserves both an innocence and a generosity of spirit.  After Lucius fights for her (already but not fatally compromised) honor, she decides to renounce her profession; on its last page, the narrative rewards both her and Lucius for her reformation.</p>","Yes"
"20503","856","Everbe Corrinthia I","Corrinthia, Everbe I","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em> Otis tells Lucius that Corrie (whose full first names are ""Everbe Corinthia"") is named for his ""Grandmaw"" (153).  Since he is identified as Corrie's nephew, it seems likely that this woman is also her mother, or as Otis calls her, her ""maw""; she died when Corrie herself was a young girl (153).</p>","No"
"20502","411","Lucius Hogganbeck","Hogganbeck, Lucius","Miss Corrie, Boon Hogganbeck","<p>First introduced into the canon as Lucius (Luke) Provine in the short story ""A Bear Hunt"" (1934), where he is a major character, he recurs in the last two novels in the Snopes trilogy and <em>The Reivers</em> as Lucius Hogganbeck.  As Provine, he is forty years old and almost toothless, a hanger-on at the hunting camp, a ""tall, apparently strong and healthy man . . . who makes no effort whatever to support his wife and three children"" (64), as well as violent, shiftless and boozy.   Twenty years earlier he was notorious in the region as the leader of a ""gang"" of delinquents; one of the gang's actions in that past gives rise to the story's main events.  In the trilogy he is not so disreputable: he owns and drives an ""automobile jitney"" - usually a small passenger bus (<em>The Town</em>, 38).  At the very end of <em>The Reivers</em> he is a newborn baby, the son of Boon and Everbe Hogganbeck.  Lucius Priest, the old man who narrates that novel's story, says he is ""already as ugly as Boon,"" but that is before he learns that the boy has been named after him: Lucius Priest Hogganbeck (305).  It's a very inconsistent biography, and his behavior as Luke Provine in the 1934 short story tarnishes - in typically Faulknerian fashion, i.e. a-chronologically - the apparent happiness of his birth almost three decades 'later' as the ending of <em>The Reivers</em> (1962), but Faulkner confirms that all these characters are the same man in his revision of ""A Bear Hunt"" for inclusion in <em>Big Woods</em> (1955), where he renamed Lucius Provine ""Lucius Hogganbeck.""</p>","Yes"
"20501","410","Louis Grenier","Grenier, Louis","","<p>Louis Grenier occupies a special place in the history of Yoknapatawpha as the ""Old Frenchman"" after whom Frenchman's Bend is named.  He himself never directly appears in any of the nine texts that mention him, though he gets closest to the narrative in ""A Name for the City"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, which describe the county during the antebellum years Grenier was there.  In half of the fictions he is referred to only as ""the Old Frenchman,"" and it's likely that none of the inhabitants of the Bend would recognize his name if they heard it.  Identified as the younger son of a Huguenot aristocrat in several of the fictions, he was one of Yoknapatawpha's original white settlers, bringing with him from Carolina the county's first slaves, and was the owner of one of the county's biggest plantations.  His mansion was designed by a Paris-educated architect - or, in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, by Grenier himself, who is described in that novel as an architect as well as a planter.  From the mansion's first appearance, however, in <em>Sanctuary</em>, through the Snopes trilogy, it looms as a kind of Gothic ruin.  It is the scene of Temple Drake's terrible ordeal in <em>Sanctuary</em>, and several of the texts note how the poor white farmers who live in the Bend have been tearing it down for firewood over the decades since the Civil War.  No one seems to know what happened to Grenier himself during or after the War.  His one descendant who still lives - or rather, squats - on a piece of the original estate is feeble-minded, and completely unaware of his aristocratic lineage.

Lonnie has no conception of his aristocratic heritage; he is ""a cheerful middleaged man with the mind and face of a child"" who lives in a decrepit shack twenty miles away from the mansion his ancestor built (74).  In the earlier ""Hand upon the Waters,"" his murder is the occasion for one of Faulkner's detective fictions.

In both those roles he is not a prepossessing figure.  It's always clear that his father Will is the owner of the store; the most original thing Jody does during his tenure is to hire Flem Snopes as a clerk - though that turns out to be his biggest mistake.  The narrator of ""Spotted Horses"" predicts at the time that in ten years, ""it would be Jody clerking for Flem Snopes"" (166); it doesn't take Flem nearly that long to displace him, though Jody remains the nominal manager.  And as Eula's older brother, his furious attempts to control her rampant sexuality have absolutely no effect.  In a passage written in Faulkner's high style, <em>The Hamlet</em> predicts that Jody will never marry: ""so that, looking at him you saw, beyond the flabbiness and the obscuring bulk, the perennial and immortal Best Man, the apotheosis of the masculine Singular"" (8).  But three hundred plus pages later the novel looks three decades into the future to describe the woman whom Jody <em>will</em> marry when he's 65.  That story remains untold.

In addition to that word, the narrator calls him a ""magician"" and ""a artist"" (123, 127). Jim displays a genius for ""doctoring"" horses and mules to disguise their flaws.

"20463","384","Mrs. Andrew Jackson","Jackson, Mrs. Andrew","","<p>President Andrew Jackson's wife, born Rachel Donelson, had been married before meeting him, and there was a legal question about the validity of  their marriages - marriages plural, because they had marry a second time after her divorce was finalized.  During the presidential campaign of 1828 Jackson's political opponents repeatedly (and unfairly) attacked her along with him.  She died between the election and his inauguration, and so was never a First Lady.  Both the ""Appendix Compson"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> use the same ironic phrase to describe this situation: Jackson believed in ""the principle that honor must be defended whether it was or not since, defended, it was, whether or not"" (326, 85).</p>","No"
"20462","385","Andrew Jackson","Jackson, Andrew","","<p>Andrew Jackson first achieved fame as a military leader in the War of 1812 with the British and in later conflicts with the Creek and the Seminole Indians.  As commander of American forces in the 'old southwest,' which included Mississippi, he negotiated treaties with other tribes; ""A Courtship"" mentions the one he signed with the Chickasaw that lived in the region where Yoknapatawpha imaginatively exists.  Jackson became the seventh President of the U.S. in 1829, where one of his most famous - or infamous - acts was to create and implement the 'Indian Removal' policy, which forced most of the Indians in Mississippi and elsewhere to leave their homes for land west of the Mississippi River.  While there is an ironic edge to the way the fictions treat Jackson, the passage in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> that notes that the new capital of the state of Mississippi was named for the ""old hero,"" the ""brawling lean fierce mangy durable old lion,"" also displays a kind of admiration for him (85).

In ""By the People"" Long is mentioned again, when Stevens compares Clarence Snopes to him, calling Long ""a madman"" as if he were still alive long after his assassination (137).

This youngest of them is definitely the son of a Sheriff Hampton in both the novels in which he appears.  As ""Big Hub"" and ""Little Hub,"" he and his father are both mentioned in <em>The Mansion</em>: at some point during Mink Snopes' tenure in jail, the son takes over the role of sheriff.  He also inherits his father's ""capacity to stay on the best of political terms with his alternating opposite number"" - the man who takes turns being sheriff with both Hamptons, Ephriam Bishop (407).  As Lucius Priest tells the story of <em>The Reivers</em> in the early 1960s, he notes that the ""Little Hub"" Hampton ""who is sheriff now"" is the grandson of the Hampton who is sheriff in 1905 (14).  Faulkner may have lost track of his Hamptons, however; chronologically it's more likely that ""Little Hub"" the great-grandson of the man who was sheriff in 1905.</p>","Yes"

While the scholarly consensus is that there are two Sheriff Hamptons, our data suggests that there are three: grandfather, father and son - or perhaps great-grandfather, grandson and great-grandson. Based on our dating of the events in the fictions as well as on the way the ""Sheriff Hampton"" appears in the texts, we believe Hampton 2 is the sheriff or mentioned in <em>The Town</em>, ""An Error in Chemistry,"" <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>.  <em>Intruder</em> describes him as ""a countryman, a farmer and the son of farmers"" (105), which would make him the grandson of Hampton 1 - but that's not always a clear case.  Like the other Hamptons, he's a big man.  Like the others, he usually seems good-natured, but according to <em>The Mansion</em>, he is ""a meat-eating hard-shell Baptist deacon whose purest notion of pleasure was counting off the folks he personally knowed was already bound for hell"" (58).  In <em>The Mansion</em> his son succeeds him as sheriff.</p>","Yes"

While the scholarly consensus is that there are two Sheriff Hamptons, our data suggests that there are three: grandfather, father and son - or perhaps great-grandfather, grandson and great-grandson.  In either case, this is the earliest Hampton, who is is county sheriff in two novels, both set around the turn into the 20th century: <em>The Hamlet</em> and <em>The Reivers</em>.  In the first novel he arrests Mink Snopes; in the second he makes sure the ""Negro girl"" whom Boon shoots by mistake gets to the doctor's, but then tells Maury Priest that ""a new dress,"" ""a bag of candy"" and ""ten dollars"" for her father is enough to ""settle"" her claim against Boon (15).</p>","Yes"

"20449","380","Jack|Zack Houston","Houston, Jack|Zack","","<p>Houston has no first name when he makes his first appearance, as one of the Bundrens' neighbors who attend Addie's funeral.  Nor is his first name given when he - or at least his absence and his corpse - become far more important in ""The Hound,"" where he is shot and killed by another Frenchman's Bend farmer.  In the Snopes trilogy he has two different first names.  As Jack in <em>The Hamlet</em> his biography is given in some detail, and includes a Negro mistress, a thirteen-year period of wandering around the U.S. in pursuit of ""that fetterless immobility called freedom"" (228), a return and brief marriage to his childhood sweetheart, and ""four years mourning"" her accidental death with a ""black, savage, indomitable fidelity"" (227).  It is perhaps the most eventful life story of any of the farmers of Frenchman's Bend, though it is still Houston's murder that determines his main role in the plot; that is even more the case when he appears as Zack in <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>.  He becomes increasingly well-off and more aggressive over the trilogy's three narratives, though even in ""The Hound"" he is called ""overbearing"" by both his killer and the Sheriff who arrests that killer (157).</p>","Yes"
"20448","379","General Hooker","Hooker, General","","<p>General 'Fighting Joe' Hooker briefly had command of the Union's Army of the Potomac.  He is best known for leading a superior Union army to a resounding defeat at Lee's hands at the 1863 battle of Chancellorsville, when (according to Cass Edmonds' account in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>) Stonewall Jackson's men ""rolled up the flank which Hooker believed could not be turned"" while Hooker himself was ""drinking rum toddies and telegraphing Lincoln that he had defeated Lee"" (272).  ""Hooker"" also gets a spot on the list in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> of the Civil War generals on both sides who had heard the ""shrill hackle-lifting"" rebel yell in battle (188).</p>","No"

The novel version identifies him as an ""oldish white man"" whom Lucas knows from another context (70). In both texts the Judge calls him ""Henry"" (222, 72).  Elsewhere in the Yoknapatawpha fictions the marshals are distinguished from the sheriffs and their deputies as the officers specifically assigned to the town rather than the county, but in this story the title 'marshal' seems equivalent to the more familiar one of 'bailiff' - the officer of the law assigned to a courthouse.</p>","Yes"

He and his wife join Mollie in mourning her grandson.  The ""Molly's brother"" who works for Eunice Habersham in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> is the same character (117).</p>","Yes"
"20440","371","Grumby's Gang","Grumby's Gang","","<p>The gang that rides with Grumby in two of the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories - ""The Unvanquished"" and ""Vendee"" - takes advantage of the lawless conditions in the region during the later years of the Civil War to pillage, terrorize and murder, without regard to race or gender, the civilians who have remained at home while the white male population is off at the fighting. Two of them - Bowden and Bridger - are given names in the story. It is not clear how many others there are. In ""The Unvanquished"" Bayard writes that there are ""about fifty or sixty"" men in the gang (93).  In ""Vendee"" however, when Ringo spies them in a dark house, he sees ""three or thirteen men"" (103); when Bayard, Ringo and Buck McCaslin later count the hoof prints of the horses the gang are riding, there are ""five"" (107).  <em>The Unvanquished</em> simply repeats these inconsistent numbers (150, 165, 171).</p>","Yes"
"20439","370","Grumby","Grumby","","<p>The outlaw named Grumby seems designed to strike every possible reader - regardless of race or region - as a villain.  He first appears in the short story ""The Unvanquished,"" as the leader of Grumby's Independents, an irregular group intent on terrorizing the Mississippi countryside, and the depredations of his gang make his name a source of terror to both the black and the white inhabitants of Yoknapatawpha. Although Grumby carries a commission allegedly signed by General Nathan Bedford Forrest, suggesting that he is loyal to the Confederacy, in fact he is interested only in wreaking havoc for his and his company's own gain.  ""Vendee"" takes place immediately after Grumby has killed Rosa Millard, with Bayard, Ringo, and Uncle Buck in pursuit of vengeance against him. When they catch him, Bayard describes him as ""a thick-built man with a reddish stubble and pale eyes, in a faded Confederate uniform coat and Yankee boots, bareheaded, with a long smear of dried blood on his cheek and one side of his coat caked with dried mud and the sleeve ripped away at the shoulder"" (112).  This story, including the grisly form their revenge takes, is repeated in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, and briefly referred to one more time in <em>The Hamlet</em>.</p>","Yes"

Ratliff's partner in the Jefferson restaurant that ultimately becomes Flem's, and then later the town's night watchman - is named Aaron Rideout when he first appears, in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  In the next two volumes of the Snopes trilogy he appears as Grover Cleveland Winbush.  (When Random House published the trilogy in one volume in 1964, they regularized his character as Winbush in all three novels.)</p>","Yes"
"20437","368","George Wyatt","Wyatt, George","","<p>In ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" and again in the chapter with that name in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, George Wyatt is a former member of Colonel John Sartoris' ""troop"" (58, 187) and a key ally in his campaign to keep freed blacks from either voting or being elected. The Wyatts whom Faulkner had written about in his earlier fictions, <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and ""A Rose for Emily,"" belong to the town's upper class, but there is no overt indication that George is a member of that family or (other than the fact that he is literate) about his own rank, in society or in the army.  In the novel's last chapter, ""An Odor of Verbena,"" George's loyalty to Colonel John Sartoris and the Southern idea of honor which demands retribution for wrongdoing lead him to push Bayard to avenge his father's death with another killing (247).</p>","Yes"
"20436","1335","George 2","George 2","","<p>The character named George who appears in <em>The Hamlet</em> is one of the deputies who help the Sheriff capture Mink.  He objects to the Sheriff's decision to take Mink to jail by a back route.</p>","Yes"
"20435","367","George 1","George 1","","<p>The George who appears in <em>Sanctuary</em> seems to be the regular porter on the train between Oxford and Holly Springs.  Clarence Snopes invariably tips him with a cigar instead of cash, but when Horace asks George what he is going to do with it, he replies ""I wouldn't give it to nobody I know"" (177).</p>","Yes"
"20434","366","General Stonewall Jackson","Jackson, General Stonewall","","<p>General Thomas Jackson - better known as Stonewall Jackson, a nickname he earned in the first major battle of the Civil War - was a corps commander in Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. He is mentioned in eight of the fictions.  What Mr. Compson in <em>Absalom!</em> calls Jackson's ""ruthless tactical skill"" was demonstrated in a number of battles (223), including the 1862 campaign ""in the [Shenandoah] Valley"" referred to in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> (274), when he successfully thwarted three Union armies.  His high status among the whites in Yoknapatawpha is attested to in several ways.  In ""The Tall Men"" Mr. Gombault recalls that serving under Stonewall Jackson was so important to Old Anse McCallum that he walked all the way from Mississippi to Virginia to enlist.  McCallum, like characters in three other fictions, named one of his sons ""Jackson"" in his honor.  But one of those cases makes the legacy of Jackson a bit more problematic.  The title character of ""Monk"" is known by that name for twenty-five years, but at his arraignment for murder he insists that his name is ""Stonewall Jackson Odlethrop"" (47). Gavin is sure that, mentally handicapped as he is, Monk could ""never have heard of Stonewall Jackson,"" the famous Confederate general, and so his only explanation for Monk's pride in the name is that he ""inherited [it] from the earth, the soil,"" that it was ""transmitted to him through a self-pariahed people - something of the bitter pride and indomitable undefeat of a soil and the men and women who trod upon it and slept within it"" (48). Gavin's grandiloquent prose builds a kind of monument to Stonewall, but the context in which Monk asserts his connection to that tradition makes the story's attitude toward it ambiguous.  Historically, Jackson was killed in 1863 when Confederate soldiers mistakenly shot him at Chancellorsville.</p>","No"
"20433","365","General Smith","Smith, General","","<p>A Union general named Smith is mentioned in four of the Yoknapatawpha fictions.  His first name never appears.  There were two Union Generals named Smith who fought Confederate Nathan Bedford Forrest in Mississippi at various times after the fall of Vicksburg. General William Sooy Smith was defeated by Forrest on February 22, 1864 in the Battle of Okolona, and did in fact fight Forrest ""up and down the road to Memphis"" - as Faulkner's General Smith does in ""The Unvanquished"" and again in the novel with that name (79, 128).  However, most scholars assume that the General Smith Faulkner has in mind is Andrew Jackson Smith, who fought Forrest at the Battle of Tupelo in July, 1864. Faulkner had a particular reason to know this Smith: that same summer he led the Union soldiers who burned both Oxford (the original of Jefferson) and Ripley, where among the houses they destroyed was the home of Colonel William Falkner, the author's great-grandfather.</p>","Yes"
"20432","364","General Sherman","Sherman, General William T.","","<p>General William T. Sherman was a Union general during the Civil War who led troops in battles that ranged from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean.  His service in the war's western theater partially accounts for the fact that his name is mentioned in 8  different fictions - and he himself, according to Faulkner's mythical history, was in Yoknapatawpha at least once: ""Wash"" notes that Sutpen's slaves emancipated themselves by following in the wake of the Union forces when ""Sherman passed through the plantation"" (537).  But the fictions depict 'Sherman' from the perspective of the white South, and what accounts for the lingering hatred you can often hear when his name appears is the event known to history as 'Sherman's March to the Sea,' when the troops he led through Georgia and the Carolinas became notorious for destroying the plantations in the path of their movement.  Also in ""Wash,"" for example, Sutpen fantasizes after the war about ""shooting"" Sherman down like a dog (536).</p>","Yes"
"20431","363","General Robert E. Lee","Lee, General Robert E.","","<p>Robert E. Lee, the most famous of the generals who led the Confederate forces during the Civil War, is mentioned in 11 different Yoknapatawpha fictions.  For most of the war he was in command of the Army of Northern Virginia, where the Confederate regiment mustered in Jefferson was fighting, but at the beginning of 1865, the last year of the war, he was appointed General-in-Chief of the Confederate States Army.  He never appears in person.  Although Faulkner's attitude toward the cause for which Lee fought changes dramatically over the course of his career, the attitude displayed by the various characters and narrators in those 11 texts toward ""Lee"" - as a military leader, a man and a 'gentleman' - remains essentially positive.</p>","No"
"20430","362","General John Pemberton","Pemberton, General John","","<p>The Confederate General whom Ringo and Bayard take turns playing in ""Ambuscade"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, John Pemberton, was a historical figure.  A career Army officer born in the North, Pemberton decided at the start of the Civil War to serve in the Confederate army - in part because he had married a southerner and in part because he had lived in the South for many years. He was in command of Vicksburg during Grant's 1862-1863 campaign against that river town, and surrendered it to the Union forces on the Fourth of July, 1863.  General Pemberton is also mentioned in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, as a man who had defended the ""principle and right"" that ""voluntary communities"" should shall be ""secured from Federal meddling"" (86-87).</p>","No"
"20429","823","General Albert Johnston","Johnston, General Albert","","<p>On the list of Civil War military leaders that appears in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, there are  ""two Johnstons"" (188). There were actually three Confederate Generals named Johnston, but it's likely that Faulkner is thinking of Joseph, who has his own character entry, and Albert S. Johnston, who was killed early in the War but not, according to the narrative, before he would have heard the Confederates' ""shrill hackle-lifting yelling"" during the fighting (188). (The other possibility is the less famous Robert D. Johnston.  Only 'Joe' Johnston appears in other fictions.</p>","No"
"20428","361","General Joseph Johnston","Johnston, General Joseph","","<p>The historical figure General Joseph Johnston - often referred to as Joe - is mentioned in seven Yoknapatawpha fictions, though he doesn't appear in any of them. For much of the Civil War he was in charge of Confederate forces in the western theater, which included Mississippi.</p>","No"
"20427","360","General Grant","Grant, General","","<p>Ulysses Grant ended the Civil War as the Commander-in-Chief of all Union forces, and soon afterward became the nation's 18th President. He never appears directly in the Yoknapatawpha fictions, but is mentioned in ten of them, always in connection with his leadership of the Union Army of Tennessee during and after the Vicksburg Campaign of 1862-1863. The reference to him in <em>Sanctuary</em> says he ""came through the county"" of Yoknapatawpha during that period (8; see also  ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard,"" 136).  Historically, during his first (aborted) advance on Vicksburg in December, 1862, Grant set up his headquarters in Oxford briefly.  He withdrew his forces northward after the Confederate raid on his supply depot in nearby Holly Springs, Mississippi - the real event behind the fictionalized raid that Gail Hightower obsesses over in <em>Light in August</em>.</p>","Yes"
"20426","359","General Van Dorn","Van Dorn, General Earl","","<p>The historical figure Earl Van Dorn was a Major General who led Confederate forces during much of the fighting in Mississippi until he was murdered in 1863 by a man claiming that Van Dorn was having an affair with his wife.  On 20 December 1862 he led a successful attack on General Grant's military supplies at Holly Springs, Mississippi, which was relocated by Faulkner to Jefferson in the novel <em>Light in August</em>, where it becomes the event in which Reverend Hightower's grandfather is killed.  Van Dorn's name is mentioned by Will Falls in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and by Colonel Sartoris in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, and called out by the great-grandfather of the narrator of ""Shall Not Perish,"" a Confederate veteran, while the old man dozes ""in his chair under the mulberry in the yard or on the sunny end of the front gallery or in his corner by the hearth"" (112).</p>","Yes"
"20425","358","Gavin Breckbridge","Breckbridge, Gavin","","<p>Mentioned in ""Raid"" and ""Skirmish at Sartoris,"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Gavin Breckbridge was engaged to Drusilla before the Civil War, which means it is almost certain that he belonged to the upper class. He never appears directly in Faulkner's fiction, but his death while fighting for the Confederacy at the Battle of Shiloh in 1862 marks the moment when Drusilla - as Bayard puts it in ""Skirmish"" and again in the novel - ""deliberately tried to unsex herself"" (60, 189).</p>","Yes"
"20424","355","Eustace Graham","Graham, Eustace","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Eustace Graham is ""a young lawyer"" who doesn't realize Young Bayard is drunk when he tries to introduce Sartoris to a fellow veteran named Gratton (125).  He plays a much larger role in <em>Sanctuary</em> as the District Attorney who prosecutes Lee Goodwin. According to Horace, he is a ""damn little squirt"" (185) who probably pressured the hotel into turning Ruby out. According to the narrator, he has ""a club foot, which had probably elected him to the office he now held"" (261). He earned the town's sympathy by his hard work, which got him into the State University, but at the same time made money, and acquired a reputation for unscrupulousness, playing poker ""behind drawn shades"" in the office of the livery stable (262). He is ambitious - or, as the narrator puts it, has ""a certain alert rapacity about the eyes"" (262) - and plans to run for Congress on the basis of convicting Goodwin. The ""clumsy clog-step"" he dances in the privacy of his office after Narcissa reveals Horace's plans to him suggests how excited he is at the thought of winning (as well as how little sympathy the narrator has for him, 264). It is not clear, however, whether he knows that the damning testimony against Goodwin he elicits from Temple is perjured.</p>","Yes"
"20423","354","Eugene Debs","Debs, Eugene","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> the owner of the restaurant on the Square refers to ""a man like Debs"" as a better candidate for President than Woodrow Wilson (122); in <em>The Mansion</em>, at the other end of Faulkner's career, ""Eugene Debs"" is among the people on the list provided by Charles Mallison of ""everybody they called communists now"" (237).  The historical Eugene V. Debs founded the International Workers of the World (IWW), and was the Socialist Party of America's candidate for President in 1904, 1908, 1912 and 1920. In that last election - the year after the reference in <em>Flags</em> would have been made - Debs received over 900,000 votes.</p>","No"
"20422","822","Grier, Grandfather of Res","Grier, Grandfather of Res","","<p>The man the narrator of ""Shall Not Perish"" calls ""Grandpap"" is actually his father's grandfather.  Sounding like the boy he is, the narrator says he is ""old, so old you just wouldn't believe it"" (111).  In his dotage all he talks about is ""the Confederate war,"" though the narrative does not say how he was involved in the Civil War (112).  (The narrator's mother's grandfather also served in the Civil War, but his last name wouldn't have been Grier.)</p>","Yes"
"20421","821","Unnamed Great-Grandmother of Mrs. Grier","Unnamed Great-Grandmother of Mrs. Grier","","<p>In ""Shall Not Perish,"" when Mrs. Grier consoles Major de Spain for the loss of his son in the early days of World War Two, she mentions her own grandfather who fought in the Civil War, adding that ""I reckon his mother didn't know why [he had to enlist] either, but I reckon he did"" (109).</p>","Yes"
"20420","820","Unnamed Grandfather of Mrs. Grier","Unnamed Grandfather of Mrs. Grier","","<p>Mrs. Grier mentions this character in ""Shall Not Perish"" when she is consoling Major de Spain for the loss of his son: ""my grandfather was in that old one there too"" (109), meaning the Civil War.</p>","Yes"
"20419","819","Marsh","Marsh","Unnamed Mother of Mrs. Grier","<p>Maw Grier's brother Marsh fought and was wounded in World War I.  For Mrs. Grier in ""Two Soldiers,"" her brother's decision to enlist in 1917 gives her a way to appreciate why in 1941 her oldest son Pete has ""got to go"" to the another war.  For Mr. Grier, however, Marsh's ""actual wound on the battlefields of France"" means the family has already contributed ""enough"" to U.S. war efforts (85).  Mrs. Grier mentions her brother again in ""Shall Not Perish.""</p>","Yes"
"20418","818","Grier Ancestors","Grier Ancestors","","<p>The Grier family appears in three stories from the early 1940s, but only the last of them - ""Shall Not Perish"" (1943) - mentions first generations of Griers in Yoknapatawpha.  They first farmed the land that seems to have been passed from one generation to the next.</p>","Yes"
"20417","440","Unnamed Mother of Mrs. Grier","Unnamed Mother of Mrs. Grier","","<p>Mrs. Res Grier mentions her mother in both ""Two Soldiers"" and ""Shall Not Perish.""  Like her mother, she says, whose son was wounded in France in the first World War, she cannot understand why the sons of mothers (including her own Pete) have to fight in wars.</p>","Yes"
"20416","729","Boy Grier","Grier, Boy","Mrs. Res Grier, Res Grier","<p>Unlike the upper-class boy narrators of Faulkner's previous fictions, the unnamed eight-year-old who narrates the three 'Grier' stories in the early 1940s - ""Two Soldiers,"" ""Shingles for the Lord"" and ""Shall Not Perish"" - narrates from within the class of impoverished farmers who subsist on the poor land around Frenchman's Bend.  His concerns are closely tied to his family - mother, father and brother Pete - but in the first and last of the stories Faulkner also uses him to represent his caste in a new context, the second World War.  In that context a family of poor farmers can be a rich patriotic resource.  Soldier number one in the first story is the narrator's brother Pete, who enlists in the army immediately after Pearl Harbor.  The second 'soldier' is the eight-year-old, who follows his love for Pete and his zeal for serving as far as the recruiting station in Memphis before being sent back to the Bend.  The third story is about two casualties - Pete and the son of the upper class Major de Spain have both died in combat in the Pacific - and the way this common sacrifice unites the upper and lower classes in a common cause called ""America"" (115).  The second story falls back on using the father of the Grier family in a role that Snopeses often play in Faulkner's fiction: vernacular comedy.  But even there, the boy narrator's thoughtful reflections on what the burning of a church signifies about the values that bind a community together reveals depths in both his character and his community that weren't always visible in earlier fictions' treatment of the county's rural poor.  This young narrator is not a consistent character.  He is a violent country boy who twice pulls his knife on men in ""Two Soldiers"" who is matured and considerably mellowed in ""Shall Not Perish,"" but the greatest inconsistency in the series is a narrative one.  In the first tale Faulkner's representation of the boy's perspective and voice are essentially realistic, but by the third story his intellectual and linguistic range belies his youth and class background.  The first story, for example, ends ""I set there by that soldier, crying.  We was going fast"" (99).  His last words in the second story are about his ""pap"" taking sips of toddy: ""Then he taken a long one"" (43).  ""Shall Not Perish"" ends with a 57-word sentence followed by this one: ""It was America, and it covered all the western earth"" (115).</p>","Yes"
"20415","460","Pete Grier","Grier, Pete","Res Grier, Mrs. Res Grier","<p>In ""Two Soldiers"" Pete Grier, the oldest of the two Grier sons, enlists in the Army after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  ""I got to go,"" he says; ""I jest ain't going to put up with no folks treating the United States that way"" (83).  Before December 7, 1941, he worked on his family's farm in Frenchman's Bend. The ""ten acres"" of land he himself owns was given to him by his father ""when he graduated from the Consolidated"" (82). According to his younger brother, who idolizes him, Pete was a very hard worker: ""He never got behind like Pap, let alone stayed behind"" (82).  He is last seen in Memphis on his way to basic training.  His death in combat is reported in ""Shall Not Perish,"" but in that text it is made clear by his grieving mother that he did not die in vain.</p>","Yes"
"20414","446","Mrs. Res Grier","Grier, Mrs. Res","Unnamed Mother of Mrs. Grier","<p>In ""Two Soldiers,"" the first of the three stories about the Grier family that Faulkner published in 1942 and 1943, the mother of the 'soldiers' is called ""Maw.""  Unlike her shiftless husband, although she wishes her son Pete wasn't determined to enlist, she accepts his decision to do so. Through her tears, she sends him off with mended and clean clothes and ""a shoe box of vittles"" (85). She also functions as something of a bridge between the World Wars, as her brother served in World War I.  In the second story, ""Shingles for the Lord,"" her role is much smaller; there she 'mothers' her husband with liniment and toddy.  The same narrator who called her Maw at first calls her ""Mother"" in the third story, ""Shall Not Perish, where she takes center stage.  In this story about men at war (including her grandfather and brother, who fought in the Civil War and World War I, respectively), Faulkner uses her as the voice of sympathy, wisdom and resilient patriotism.  She also brings Yoknapatawpha's highest and lowest white classes together when, as the mother of a son who has died in the fighting in the Pacific, she consoles Major de Spain over the loss of his son.  As she does so, her voice loses any vernacular inflections, sounding more like Faulkner will over the coming decades: ""All men are capable of shame. . . . Just as all men are capable of courage and honor and sacrifice.  And grief too.  It will take time, but they will learn it.  It will take more grief than yours and mine, and there will be more.  But it will be enough"" (108).</p>","Yes"
"20413","353","Res Grier","Grier, Res","","<p>Res, the farmer at the head of the Grier family, appears very differently in each of the three stories Faulkner wrote about the family during the early 1940s.  In the first, ""Two Soldiers,"" he appears almost stereotypically, as a 'shiftless' poor white farmer who is perpetually behind on his work and against his oldest son's enlistment, apparently so that he can keep his labor on the farm: ""the country ain't being invaded,"" he says, and besides, he spent almost eight months during the first World War in uniform in Texas, which should be ""enough for me and mine to have to do to protect the country"" (85).  In ""Shingles for the Lord,"" although still characterized by his poverty - ""I don't own anything that even I would borrow,"" he claims (34) - he shows himself as a trickster, and over-reacher, and a cock-eyed optimist.  In the last of the three, ""Shall Not Perish,"" he appears a hard-working farmer, a thoughtful husband, and a father who takes care even to make sure his son's shoes are well-shined.  These differences are typical of Faulkner's willingness to adapt even his recurring characters to the imaginative needs of a new text.  The fact that when this character recurs in two texts from the 1950s he has a different first name is typical too, given Faulkner's carelessness about checking previous fictions when he wrote new ones.  So in ""By the People"" and again in <em>The Mansion</em>, it is Eck Grier rather than Res who tries to get ahead by swapping a dog for a piece of work, an incident first described in ""Shingles for the Lord.""</p>","Yes"
"20412","352","Doctor Alford","Alford, Doctor","","<p>Doctor Alford appears in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> as a ""newcomer"" to Jefferson in his ""thirties"" (93).  He shares offices with Dr. Peabody but expresses impatience and often contempt for Peabody's traditional ideas about the practice of medicine. He is courting Narcissa Benbow, but without arousing much interest in her.  He is mentioned in <em>As I Lay Dying</em> when MacGowan tells Jody to send Dewey Dell ""upstairs to Alford's office"" when she asks ""to see the doctor that works"" there (241).  In this novel it's not clear that ""Alford's office"" has any connection with Peabody, who does appear in it.</p>","Yes"

Like many other white Yoknapatawphans, he is probably away in the War.</p>","Yes"
"20410","350","Doctor Lucius Peabody","Peabody, Doctor Lucius","","<p>Doctor Lucius Peabody is the only character who appears in the first three Yoknapatawpha novels: <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em>.  He is only mentioned by Quentin in the second, but makes memorable appearances in the other two.  According to <em>Flags</em>, he is ""the fattest man"" in the county (94).  His medical practice takes him ""out at any hour of the twenty-four in any weather and for any distance, over practically impassable roads in a lopsided buckboard to visit anyone, white or black, who sent for him"" (95).  He was Colonel Sartoris' regimental surgeon during the Civil War, and his roots in Yoknapatawpha probably go all the way back to the earliest days of the settlement: there is an earlier 'Doctor Peabody' mentioned in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.  He treats the upper class Sartorises, Compsons, and so on, but also the poor white Bundrens.  The one black person he treats is the girl whom Boon shoots in <em>The Reivers</em> - at least, it is to his office that she is taken for treatment, though in that instance he himself remains offstage.  He appears altogether in six novels and two short stories, and Faulkner, who clearly has a great affection for him, may have been thinking of him in other texts where the doctor is unnamed.</p>","Yes"
"20409","817","Doctor Peabody 2","Doctor Peabody 2","","<p>In ""A Name for the City"" and again in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> ""Doctor Peabody"" is one of the ""new faces"" that arrive in Yoknapatawpha after the first group of pioneers and becomes ""old Doctor Habersham's successor"" as the community's physician (206). He is presumably an ancestor of the Doctor Peabody who in other fictions takes care of Yoknapatawpha's sick and wounded until well into the twentieth century, but neither text ever specifies the relationship between the two men. This earlier Peabody provides laudanum to add to the whiskey given to the militia for their celebration. He also figures out the way to resolve the crisis of the missing padlock, and in the process finds a name for the city-in-progress.</p>","Yes"
"20408","349","Doctor Habersham","Habersham, Doctor","","<p>Doctor Habersham is one of the original three white settlers in Yoknapatawpha, or as it's put in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, the first text to mention him, one of the men ""who had ridden horseback into the county before its boundaries had ever been surveyed and located and named"" (73).  According to <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, in fact, with his ""worn black bag of pills and knives"" he was so important to the settlement that for a time the place that became Jefferson was known as ""Doctor Habersham's"" (202). In that novel and the earlier ""A Name for the City,"" Habersham is a widower with one son, a son who moves west with the Chickasaws during the 'Removal,' but somehow the Habersham name continues in Yoknapatawpha County well into the 20th century, and other descendants of his appear other texts.  He himself plays a role in the story of how Jefferson got its name in ""A Name for the City"" and <em>Requiem</em>, the only works in which he appears.</p>","Yes"

Segar characters had appeared in newspapers at least two years before <em>Sanctuary</em> was published.)</p>","No"
"20405","814","Unnamed Doctor 2","Unnamed Doctor 2","","<p>The first of the two unnamed doctors who appear in <em>Sanctuary</em> is the Jefferson physician who attends Ruby's child; after her child has a bad night in the hotel, Ruby tells Horace that ""I finally got the doctor"" (135).  The doctor who appears in all three previous Yoknapatawpha novels is named Peabody, described as the fattest man in Yoknapatawpha County, but this doctor is someone else, ""a young man with a small black bag"" whom Horace obviously has never seen before (135).  (In the various fictions there are three named Jefferson doctors who appear more than once - Habersham in the early life of the town; Peabody and Alford in the 20th century - but there are also over a dozen doctors who are never named.  It's possible that Faulkner might have imagined one or more of them as Alford, or that he might have had the same different doctor in mind for more than one of the unnamed ones, but since the texts provide no evidence of that, we have created separate entries for all the local doctors without names.)</p>","Yes"

"20394","347","Devries","Devries","","<p>In both ""By the People"" and <em>The Mansion</em> Devries is the good man from an (invented) county east of Yoknapatawpha who challenges Clarence Snopes in a political race for Congress; in the story it's the 1952 election, while for the novel Faulkner moves it back to 1946.  That change necessitates a revision in his biography.  In ""By the People"" Devries has been a soldier ""in that decade between 1942 and 1952"" (133), and comes back from fighting in Korea with a chest full of medals, including ""the top one"" (134) - i.e. the Congressional Medal of Honor - and a ""mechanical leg"" (136).  As a officer in both World War II and the Korean War, he served with great heroism in command of ""Negro troops"" (134); the narrative treats his war record as extremely admirable, but Snopes has no trouble convincing the racists in the electorate that Devries is ""a lover of Negroes and hence subversive to our entire way of life"" (136).  In <em>The Mansion</em> Devries is promoted to ""Colonel"" (342) and all the combat Devries has seen occurs in the Pacific theater during World War II.  Other than that difference, however, his sterling character and his lack of racial prejudice - as well as the ""human baseness"" (342) these qualities bring out in Snopes and at least a large part of the electorate - are the same in both texts.</p>","Yes"

Physically his most striking feature seems to be his hair; Peabody calls it ""pushed and matted up . . . like a dipped rooster"" (44).  He narrates three chapters in which he portrays himself as both the victim of ""bad luck"" and ""them"" - the anonymous people who make his life so hard (36).  His neighbors, however, and most readers instead see how successful he is at getting other people to do all his work for him.  Darl observes, ""I have never seen a sweat stain on his shirt.

Chronologically this places him between Cash and Jewel.  But psychologically he has no place: unlike his older and his younger brother, he was born completely outside the circle of his mother's love. The most prolific narrator in the novel (he narrates 19 chapters), he also seems to be omniscient, as he often narrates events at which he is not present (nor does he narrate them as though he is recounting a story he was told).  His strange narrative status is reinforced by an apparent ability to communicate with his siblings without words and by a vocabulary that often seems at odds with his socio-economic status (though his service ""at the war"" - that is, World War I - is sometimes cited as an experience that may have opened him up to a larger knowledge base and given him access to very contemporary terms like ""cubistic,"" 254, 219). Cora tells us that he is ""the one that folks say is queer"" (24).  Her husband diagnoses Darl's problem in vernacular terms: ""he just thinks by himself too much"" (71).  A more sophisticated analyst would say that, like Quentin Compson at the other end of the social hierarchy, his problem is consciousness itself.  His actions or inaction often drive the dramatic tension in the novel.  Except for a mention in ""Spotted Horses"" of a ""Mrs. Bundren"" who may be Addie, Darl in the only member of his family who appears in any other text.  The juvenile narrator of ""Uncle Willy"" refers twice to the end of Darl's story, when he is taken away to ""the asylum at Jackson"" (228).

"20346","769","Tull, Daughters of Vernon","Tull, Daughters of Vernon","","<p>The children of Frenchman's Bend farmer Vernon Tull and his wife are all girls, but there is no consensus among the fictions about how many daughters they have.  In the earliest representation of the Tull family, <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, there are two, named Eula and Kate.  In ""Spotted Horses"" there are three - none named.   In <em>The Hamlet</em>, there are four, again not named; though one of these girls is referred to as the ""biggest"" when all four appear at the Snopes trial, they are described as a unit when they ""turn their heads as one head"" (357).  Similarly, the narrator of ""Two Soldiers"" refers generically to ""them girls of Tull's"" (83).

"20343","491","Vernon Tull","Tull, Vernon","","<p>Vernon Tull is a farmer in Frenchman's Bend who appears in ten different Yoknapatawpha fictions.  In <em>As I Lay Dying</em> he narrates six of the novel's sections, which gives readers a particularly intimate connection to him; in these chapters he is one of the novel's more reliable commentators, particularly when he suggests that it might be a mistake for a person ""to spend too much time thinking"" (71).  Many of the references to him across the canon specifically mention his family; in <em>The Hamlet</em> the narrator calls him ""the face of the breathing archetype and protagonist of all men who marry young and father only daughters and are themselves but the eldest daughter of their own wives"" (10).  In ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard,"" on the other hand, he is described as ""a well-to-do bachelor"" (142) who is wealthy enough to cover the note for ""one thousand dollars"" with which he buys a one-third share of the Old Frenchman's place (149).

"20342","341","Cora Tull","Tull, Cora","","<p>The wife of Vernon and the mother of a fluxuating number of daughters, Cora Tull is described by the third-person narrator of <em>The Hamlet</em> as a ""strong, full-bosomed though slightly dumpy woman"" whose face perpetually wears ""an expression of grim and seething outrage . . . directed not at any Snopes or at any other man in particular but at all men, all males"" (357).  This is a more extreme version of the 'Cora Tull' whom readers meet in the earlier <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, where she narrates three sections herself, and plays a substantial role as Addie's nearest neighbor.  Like Addie, she was once a school teacher.  Both her sections and the larger narrative reveal her to be a frugal, officious and conscientious woman who is fond of singing hymns inside and outside of church. She attends Addie at her deathbed, and in her commentaries often sees ""God's bounteous love for His creatures"" in very unlikely places (24).

Across these texts as well as <em>The Unvanquished</em> he appears as a chivalrous gentleman who knows how to treat a lady like Rosa Millard even in the midst of the confict between Yankees and rebels.  When his troop of Ohio cavalry comes to the Sartoris plantation looking for Colonel John in the first story, he wins her respect by tactfully accepting the lie he knows she is telling about the whereabouts of Bayard and Ringo.  In the later ""Raid,"" she seeks him out among the crowds of Union soldiers and self-emancipating slaves to help in retrieving the silver and mules that a different Union unit has confiscated - which he gives her without hesitation.</p>","Yes"

This ""Chevalier"" has emigrated from Paris to the French colony of Louisiana, though two of the stories also show him back in France as an old man.  Thematically he may represent the frontier world out of which Yoknapatawpha emerged, with its blend of frontier raggedness and aristocratic pretensions, but his main role in the fictions is as the source of Ikkemotubbe's subriquet: De Vitry calls him ""du homme,"" the Man, after the name of the tribal chief, and this nickname morphs into ""Doom.""</p>","Yes"

During the War he ""run off with the Yankees"" (66, 199), but has returned to Jefferson and been appointed ""Acting Marshal"" by the northerners who are trying to reconstruct the town's government (66, 199).  It is his possible election as Marshal that precipitates the story's climax.</p>","Yes"
"20334","766","Captain Warren","Warren, Captain","","<p>In the 1932 short story ""Death Drag"" Captain Warren is a well-to-do war veteran who has established himself comfortably in his home town; adults and children alike know him as ""an ex-army flyer"" who ""was in the war"" (185, 188). There is actually no clear evidence in the story that Warren's home town <em>is</em> Jefferson, and its likely that if he did live in Yoknapatawpha he would have been mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (1929), with its focus on aviators and returning wounded veterans.  But when in 1945-1946 Malcolm Cowley collected a set of Faulkner's texts for the Viking <em>Portable Faulkner</em>, he asked Faulkner to draw another map of Yoknapatawpha (like the one he had done for <em>Absalom!</em> a decade earlier), and the map Faulkner drew clearly locates ""Death Drag"" inside his mythical county.  So in what could be called a retro-fitting of that short story into the canon he includes Captain Warren in the 1949 story ""Knight's Gambit,"" which is set just before the U.S. entry into the next world war.  In that story Warren is a farmer who lives a few miles from Jefferson, but still called Captain Warren on account of his service as ""a flight commander in the old Royal Flying Corps before it became the RAF"" (206).

He is the only son of Calvin Burden I and Evangeline.  Like his father, he runs away from home as a teenager.  In the far west he meets Juana, and they have a son, Calvin Burden II, born out of wedlock in 1854.  With his father and son he moves to Jefferson in 1866, ""to help with the freed negroes"" (251).  After they are killed, he buries them in secret a half mile from his house, and it is in that hidden cemetery that he tells Joanna (daughter of his second marriage, to an unnamed woman from New England) about the divine ""curse"" that falls on everyone as a result of slavery (252).</p>","Yes"
"20313","393","Joanna Burden","Burden, Joanna","","<p>A major character in <em>Light in August</em>, Joanna Burden is a middle-aged spinster who has lived in the ""old colonial plantation house"" (36) outside Jefferson since she was born, yet ""she is still a stranger, a foreigner whose people moved in from the North during Reconstruction"" (46). Nurturing and helpful to local Negroes, and a contributor to and supporter of many Negro schools and colleges across the South, she is regarded by the townspeople as a ""Yankee, a lover of Negroes"" (46). She is forty-something when she begins her complex and ultimately fatal relationship with Joe Christmas.  Her death at his hands transforms her standing with the white townspeople.  She re-appears only once in the fictions, or rather her name does, when in <em>The Mansion</em> a character uses ""Miss Joanna Burden's mailbox one mile west of the courthouse"" as a geographical reference point (206).</p>","Yes"
"20312","751","Evangeline Burden","Burden, Evangeline","","<p>In <em>Light in August</em> Evangeline Burden is the first wife of Calvin Burden I, and the mother of their four children.

The first time, in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Will Falls refers to them as ""them two cyarpet-baggers"" (23).  They are given names in <em>Light in August</em>, where the same event is retold from Joanna Burden's perspective.  The younger of these men is her half-brother, Calvin Burden II; Joanna calls him ""a boy who had never even cast his first vote"" (249).  The last two times this story is told, from Bayard Sartoris' perspective in ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, he is one of ""the two Burdens from Missouri"" (66), but not otherwise described.  He moves with his family to Jefferson after the War, and is working with his grandfather (Calvin I) for the rights of the newly emancipated slaves, presumably as an agent of the Federal government - which is admirable from Joanna's perspective but outrageous from Falls'.  Bayard's perspective is more ambiguous.  In a conversation with Drusilla about them that only appears in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, he calls them ""carpet baggers,"" but also ""men.

They are given names in <em>Light in August</em>, where the same event is retold from Joanna Burden's perspective.  The oldest of these men is her grandfather, Calvin Burden I; he lost one of his arms fighting against slavery as ""a member of a troop of partisan guerilla horse"" in 1861 (244).  The last two times this story is told, from Bayard Sartoris' perspective in ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, he is one of ""the two Burdens from Missouri"" (66), but not otherwise described.  He and his family move to Jefferson after the War to work for the rights of the newly emancipated slaves, presumably as an agent of the Federal government - which is admirable from Joanna's perspective but offensive to Falls.  Bayard's perspective is more ambiguous.  In a conversation with Drusilla about them that only appears in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, he calls them ""carpet baggers,"" but also ""men.  Human beings"" (223).  Drusilla, on the other hand, calls them ""northerners, foreigners who had no business here.  They were pirates"" (223).

"20309","327","Buck Hipps","Hipps, Buck","","<p>Faulkner recounts or mentions the auction of the wild horses in Frenchman's Bend in four different texts.  The auctioneer is a ""Texas man,"" as the narrator of ""Spotted Horses"" repeatedly calls him (167), a ""broad-hatted stranger"" in ""Centaur in Brass"" (150), ""that Texas feller"" in <em>The Town</em> (35), and Buck Hipps in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  His character is displayed in detail in that novel and ""Spotted Horses.""  In both texts he is armed with an ""ivory-handled pistol"" - though he also carries ""a box of gingersnaps"" right next to the gun (167, 300).  He is Flem Snopes' accomplice in fleecing the men of Frenchman's Bend, but unlike Flem he displays a conscience when he tries to return to Mrs. Armstid the five dollars her husband spent on a pony.  And like the hero of a western, he rides off at the end of the auction - though in his case the goal is to get away before the hapless men of the Bend try to capture the horses they've bought.</p>","Yes"
"20308","748","Buck Connors II","Buck Connors II","Buck Conner|Connors","<p>In <em>The Town</em>, Buck Connors II is the son of Marshal Buck Connors and friends with Chick Mallison.

"20307","326","Buck Conner|Connors","Conner|Connors, Buck","","<p>A Jefferson town marshal who appears in several of the fictions, though as ""Buck"" in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, as ""Buck Conner"" in ""Centaur in Brass"" and <em>Light in August</em>, and as ""Buck Conners"" in <em>The Town</em>.  In the first novel he follows Miss Jenny's orders to get care of Young Bayard, giving up his own bed in the jail building to allow Sartoris to sleep off the effects of his fall and his drinking. Flem Snopes pays him a compliment of sorts in ""Centaur"": ""Buck Conner'll know that even a fool has got more sense than to steal something and hide it in his corn-crib"" (159).  In <em>Light in August</em> he assists Sheriff Kennedy at the scene of Joanna's murder.  <em>The Town</em> also mentions his son ""Buck Conners II,"" another town marshal.</p>","Yes"
"20306","325","Bridger","Bridger","","<p>Briefly mentioned by name in ""Vendee"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Bridger is one the men in Grumby's gang; he assists Matt Bowden in surrendering Grumby to Bayard and Ringo.</p>","Yes"
"20305","324","Booker T. Washington","Washington, Booker T.","","<p>At the end of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> Gavin mentions ""Booker T. Washington"" twice while talking to Lucas, contrasting the way Lucas did ""what nobody expected you to"" with how Washington ""did only what everybody expected of him"" (237).  Gavin's meaning is extremely difficult to pin down.  The historical Booker T. Washington was born into slavery but by the end of the 19th century was perhaps the best-known black leader in America.  As the principal of Tuskegee Institute, a prominent orator and an adviser to several U.S. presidents, his ideas about how to improve the position of blacks in American society were both controversial and influential.  When in <em>The Mansion</em> the principal of Jefferson's ""Negro grammar and high school"" (246) mentions Washington to Gavin as part of his effort to persuade Linda Snopes to give up her idea of reforming black education in town, he identifies his position with what ""Mr Washington said"" (248).  There too Faulkner's meaning is not self-evident, and it seems noteworthy that Gavin doesn't at first understand the allusion to ""Mr Washington.""</p>","No"
"20304","322","Birdsong","Birdsong","","<p>In ""Pantaloon in Black"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Birdsong is the white night-watchman at the mill whom Rider kills.  For fifteen years he has run a crap game using ""crooked dice"" which allow him to cheat the black mill workers out of some of their weekly pay.  He is part of a large family clan; as the deputy sheriff says, ""It’s more of them Birdsongs than just two or three. . . . There’s forty-two active votes in that connection"" (252, 148).  Birdsong is repeatedly referred to in the narrative as ""the white man"" who carries a ""heavy pistol in his hip pocket"" (250-51, 145).  His killing is briefly referred to by Temple Drake in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, where he is the ""white man"" whom the Negro widower kills ""in a dice game"" (156).</p>","Yes"
"20303","747","Theron Quick","Quick, Theron","","<p>Theron Quick, who appears in <em>The Hamlet</em> as one of the suitors for Eula Varner's hand, could be Lon Quick's son, who appears elsewhere in the novel and has a separate entry in our database.  He is among the suitors who ambush McCarron, but ends up being beaten unconscious by Eula, who defends McCarron with her father's buggy whip.  He is also one of the two Frenchman's Bend suitors who leave the area ""suddenly overnight"" once it is discovered that Eula is pregnant - though Ratliff believes both of these young men were ""just wishing they had"" (140).</p>","Yes"
"20301","746","Mrs. Solon Quick","Quick, Mrs. Solon","","<p>In ""Shall Not Perish,"" the wife of Solon Quick lives with him on a farm in Frenchman's Bend.

This entry is Lon Junior's, who appears in three texts altogether.  In his first appearance, in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, he is the neighbor to the Bundren family who finds Dr. Peabody’s buckboard ""upside down straddle of the ditch about a mile from the spring"" (85), and is at Samson's when the Bundrens ride by (112).  In the other texts he is only mentioned, curiously, in connection with recognizing other men's horses.</p>","Yes"
"20299","745","Solon Quick","Quick, Solon","","<p>There are several Quicks living in Frenchman's Bend - Faulkner scholars don't agree on how many. To Brooks, Solon and Lon Quick are one character. Dasher and Kirk, on the other hand, separate them into two characters, which is what we also do in our data. This entry is for Solon, who appears in three Yoknapatawpha fictions as one of the farmers in the Bend.  He is a major character in the comic ""Shingles for the Lord,"" where he and Res Grier try to out-smart each other in a dog-and-work swapping transaction.  The story also mentions that Quick drives the ""school-bus truck"" (27) - a bus he made by customizing the body of a truck - that takes the children of Frenchman's Bend to school during the week and the people of Frenchman's Bend to town on Saturdays.  He and that bus appear together in ""Shall Not Perish,"" where he charges everyone, even his wife, the same round-trip fare: twenty-five cents.  In <em>The Mansion</em> he is only mentioned, by Mink Snopes, as the local man who might have been the one who saw a bear ""three years ago"" (34).</p>","Yes"

Dasher and Kirk, on the other hand, separate them into two characters, which is what we also do in our data.  And it is not absolutely clear how to disambiguate Lon Sr. and his son Lon Jr., or as another character puts it in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, where the family first appears, ""Big Lon I mean, not little Lon"" (161).  This entry is for Lon Sr.  In the texts where he appears, he is described variously as a farmer, a sawmill operator, or the local constable.  In none of these occupations or texts does he play a significant role, but in two of them he bids on one of the wild ponies, and in one - <em>As I Lay Dying</em> - it seems that he actually managed to hold on to it before selling it to Jewel Bundren.</p>","Yes"
"20297","744","Mrs. Ben Quick","Quick, Mrs. Ben","","<p>Mrs. Ben Quick makes a very brief appearance in ""Tomorrow"" when Isham Quick refers to ""the dishes and skillet [that] mammy"" let Fentry have while he lived in the boiler room at the sawmill (105).</p>","Yes"

"20294","321","Ben Quick","Ben Quick","","<p>Ben Quick is an inhabitant of Frenchman's Bend, though he appears differently in the two texts that mention him.

"20293","320","Nathan Bedford Forrest","Forrest, Nathan Bedford","","<p>Historically, Nathan Bedford Forrest was a slave dealer before the Civil War, one of the Confederacy's most successful cavalry officers during the war, and a founder of the Ku Klux Klan after the war.  Although the KKK appears in several fictions (for example, <em>Absalom!</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>), none of the eleven fictions that mention Forrest connect him with it, or make any reference to his actions after the war.  The majority of them locate Forrest in the context of his role as a military thorn in the side of the Union forces in the war's western theater - not surprisingly, since much of the fighting he directed took place very close to the part of Mississippi where Yoknapatawpha is supposed to be.  John Sartoris' troop of irregulars, for example, serves under his command, at least indirectly, in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories, and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.  When Charles Bon is buried in <em>Absalom!</em>, Theophilus McCaslin cheers ""Yaaaa, Forrest!"" (122).  The narrator of ""Shall Not Perish"" notes that his great-grandfather would holler ""Forrest,"" among other names, while dozing ""in his chair under the mulberry in the yard or on the sunny end of the front gallery or in his corner by the hearth"" (112). Forrest's name also lurks in the names of two sons of the Gowrie clan in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> and on the (probably counterfeit) authorization papers that the outlaw Grumby carries in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, and it occupies second billing in the title Faulkner gave the short story ""My Grandmother Millard and General Bedford Forrest and the Battle of Harrykin Creek.""  In that story Forrest appears in person, ""a big, dusty man with a beard so black it looked almost blue and eyes like a sleepy owl,"" playing the improbable role of assistant match-maker (691).  That story alludes to his life before the war in Memphis, but does not mention slaves.  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, however, the plantation ledgers that Ike McCaslin reads record, in Ike's uncle's hand, that one of the slaves his family owned was ""bought from N.B. Forest at Cold Water 3 Mar 1856 $265. dolars"" (250).  Since Faulkner's time ""Nathan Bedford Forrest"" has become for many an admonitory figure, but in the Yoknapatawpha fictions as a whole he sits on a pedestal among the heroes of the Confederacy.</p>","Yes"

"20290","741","Armstid Children","Armstid Children","Henry Armstid, Mrs. Armstid","<p>The number of children born on the Armstid farm in Frenchman's Bend is either four or five. A character in ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard"" refers to them as ""them chaps"" (138), but at least one is a daughter: in ""Spotted Horses,"" Ina May, the only one ever named, is twelve, and ""big enough to take care of the little ones"" while their mother is at Mrs. Littlejohn's nursing their father (178). Though unnamed, she plays the same role in <em>The Hamlet</em>. In <em>Light in August</em> there are five children, all born ""in six years,"" and now ""raised to man- and womanhood"" (15).</p>","Yes"
"20289","740","Ina May Armstid","Armstid, Ina May","Mrs. Armstid, Henry Armstid","<p>In ""Spotted Horses"" the oldest child of the Armstids is named Ina May.  She is ""about twelve"" (178), and takes care of her younger siblings while her mother is shuttling back and forth to Mrs. Littlejohn's. According to Mrs. Armstid ""Ina May bars the door"" and keeps ""the axe in bed with her"" while her mother is away (179).  When <em>The Hamlet</em> retells this story the Armstids' twelve-year-old daughter is not named, but she plays the same offstage role, guarding over the ""littlest ones"" with an axe through the nights her mother is away (347).</p>","Yes"
"20288","436","Mrs. Armstid","Armstid, Mrs.","","<p>The wife of the farmer named Armstid appears or is mentioned in seven texts; she is unnamed in five of them, but her name is Lula in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, the first one, and Martha in <em>Light in August</em>.  That is not the only inconsistency in her character.  In both these novels she doesn't hesitate to speak her mind to her husband; in ""Spotted Horses,""  however, she is extremely self-effacing, submitting without complaint to her husband's abusive behavior.  In that story and ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard"" she makes extra income for her poor family by ""weaving by the firelight after dark,"" as the latter story puts it (142); in <em>Light in August</em> she sells eggs.  In every text, however, she is identified as thrifty and hard-working, characterized by details like her ""soap-raw hands"" (<em>Hamlet</em>, 321); ""Lizards"" even mentions the time she pulled the plow after the family's mule dies.</p>","Yes"
"20287","316","Henry Armstid","Armstid, Henry","","<p>Henry Armstid, a subsistence farmer who lives in Frenchman's Bend, appears in two very different ways in seven different fictions.  In <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, both the chapter he himself narrates and his actions reveal him to be generous, reliable and sane.  In <em>Light in August</em> he displays the same traits as he helps Lena Grove on her journey.  In his second appearance, however, in ""Spotted Horses,"" he is a poor and foolish farmer who is both emotionally and physically abusive to his wife: in spite of her pleas, he squanders her hard-earned five dollars on one of the spotted horses, and then ""hits her with the rope"" he is trying to use to catch the animal (172).  His actions in ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard"" are similarly desperate; there, and again in <em>The Hamlet</em>, he is last seen franctically digging in the dirt at the Old Frenchman's place looking for a treasure that isn't there.  Later references to him emphasize this 'Armstid,' the poor man defined by what <em>The Hamlet</em> calls the ""impotence and fury"" of his hapless attempts to improve his life (372).  His one wife appears in five of these texts under two different names, making it possible that Faulkner really is thinking of two different men named Armstid, but while that would resolve the contradictions in his character, it seems unlikely.</p>","Yes"

The Holland brothers share ""dark, identical, aquiline faces"" (15), but have different temperaments. Virginius, as the twin who probably takes after his mother, tries to mediate between his brother and their father.  No one has ever witnessed Virginius lose his temper.  Nonetheless, even Virginius is forced by his father, eventually, to vacate the Mardis-Holland home.  Hereafter, Virginius lives with his cousin Granby Dodge, whose mortgages he rather naively pays off.</p>","Yes"
"20283","736","Cornelia Mardis Holland","Holland, Cornelia Mardis","","<p>In ""Smoke,"" Cornelia Holland is the daughter and only child of Mr. Mardis.  She marries Anselm Holland (Senior).  She bears him twin sons - Anselm (Junior) and Virginius - of whom the former ""was said to have been the mother’s favorite"" (4).  Her father's property is held in her name after his death.  She dies of unspecified causes when her sons are still children, though the narrator and others believe ""her life had been worn out by the crass violence of [her husband,] an underbred outlander"" (4).</p>","Yes"
"20282","735","Anselm Holland II","Holland, Anselm II","Anselm Holland I","<p>In ""Smoke"" Anselm Junior is one of the twin sons of Anselm Holland.

"20281","734","Anselm Holland I","Holland, Anselm I","","<p>In ""Smoke,"" the older Anselm Holland is what the people of Yoknapatawpha consider an ""outlander"" (4) - i.e. someone who was not only born outside the county, but who remains estranged from the community no matter how long he or she lives there.  Of an unremittingly violent, misanthropic, and crass nature, he alienates his sons, desecrates the graves in the Mardis Cemetery, and allows his sons’ rightful inheritance of farm and house to go to ruin for spite.</p>","Yes"
"20280","315","Anse Holland","Holland, Anse","","<p>In ""Fool about a Horse"" and again in <em>The Hamlet</em> ""Old Man Anse Holland"" (118, 33) is the landowner from whom ""Pap"" (in the short story) and Ab Snopes (in the novel) rent the farm they work on as a tenant farmer.  In the novel, Ratliff lives on another tenant farm that Holland owns, ""about a mile away"" (33) - a distance that suggests that Holland is a large landowner, like the Sartorises or the McCaslins.  Holland himself appears only once, vaguely, at the end of both accounts, when Pap or Ab go up to his place to try to borrow a mule; Ratliff's phrase ""when he [Holland] finished cussing"" (51) suggests how impatient he is with Ab's continual appropriation of his belongings, but that's all we know about him.  (There are two characters named ""Anselm Holland"" in ""Smoke,"" and another ""Holland"" in ""Tomorrow,"" but there is no indication of a connection among these characters.)</p>","Yes"

"20277","313","Alexander Holston","Holston, Alexander","","<p>One of the first white men in Yoknapatawpha, Alexander Holston established a tavern in Jefferson before the town had any name at all.  The ""Holston House"" that survives in the town in the mid-20th century has had several remodelings, but is still run by descendants with the same last name - making them and the business the most definite point of continuity between Yoknapatawpha's past and its present.  Holston himself appears in ""A Name for the City"" and <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, where he owns slaves and a padlock that plays a major role in Jefferson's history, and he is probably the ""Doctor Holston"" who appears in ""My Grandmother Millard,"" though Faulkner seems there to have confused him with Doctor Habersham, who came into Yoknapatawpha with Holston decades before the Civil War.

She lives in a cabin behind the white family's house.  Like her employer, Maggie Mallison, she is protective about her own child, but she is also a kind of 'mammy' to Chick Mallison.   She is never given a last name, but the earlier novel mentions her father Ephriam, and the later novel gives her a husband (Big Top) and another son (Top, or Little Top).</p>","Yes"
"20275","312","Aleck Sander","Aleck Sander","Paralee|Guster, Top","<p>Aleck Sander is not a first and last name, but the way this character's given name, Alexander, is spoken.  He is the son of the woman who cooks for the Mallison|Stevens family; in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> her name is Paralee, and in <em>The Town</em> it's Guster.   In both novels Aleck Sander is the companion of Chick Mallison, though the relationship and his character are much more fully developed in the first novel.  The two boys are the same age, sixteen, but Aleck Sander is black, and thus his place is inescapably constrained by what the novel calls the ""pattern of Negro behavior"" decreed by southern society (24).  When they eat together it's in Paralee's cabin, not the Mallison house (in Sheriff Hampton's house Aleck Sander is left in the kitchen to eat by himself while Chick eats with the other whites in the dining room, 111); when they hunt, Chick carries a rifle and Aleck Sander a homemade ""tapstick"" (5); Chick goes to ""school,"" Aleck Sander goes to the ""Negro school"" (126).  The young Negro steps far outside those patterns, however, when he courageously accompanies Chick and Miss Habersham into Beat Four, to exhume the body of a white man in order to save a black man's life, proving to be very valuable on that mission.  Afterwards he largely disappears from the story, but in the novel's middle chapters Aleck Sander represents an important challenge to racial stereotypes.  He appears in some of the chapters that Chick narrates in <em>The Town</em>, but in a much less significant role; that novel also mentions his father (Big Top) and brother (Top).</p>","Yes"
"20274","311","Alec","Alec","","<p>In ""Pantaloon in Black"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Rider's ""Unc Alec"" tells him that his aunt wants him to come home (249, 143).

"20270","309","Adolph Hitler","Hitler, Adolph","","<p>Adolph Hitler was the infamous leader of Nazi Germany from 1933 until his death in 1945 at the end of World War II. He is first mentioned in ""Delta Autumn,"" where Ike McCaslin calls him an ""Austrian paper-hanger"" (322) - repeating a term of contempt that was popular in America at the time; Hitler was born in Austria-Hungary, but there's no evidence that he was ever a ""paper-hanger.""  In <em>The Mansion</em> Gavin Stevens calls him ""the Nibelung maniac"" (258).</p>","No"
"20269","307","Abraham Lincoln","Lincoln, Abraham","","<p>Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the U.S. who led the nation during the Civil War, is mentioned in 10 Yoknapatawpha fictions, almost as many as Robert E. Lee - and more than twice as many as Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy.  He never appears in person, and is typically represented from the perspective of one or another former Confederate.  In ""Wash,"" Colonel Thomas Sutpen longs to ""shoot [Lincoln and General Sherman] down, like the dogs they are"" (540).  But in ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em> Colonel John Sartoris regrets the assassination of Lincoln, believing that had he lived, the (white) defeated South would have been treated better in the aftermath of the war.</p>","No"
"20268","306","Old Man Killegrew","Killegrew, Old Man","","<p>Old Man Killgrew is a farmer who lives near the Griers in Frenchman's Bend.  Although he never appears in person, he is mentioned in all three of the World War II stories about the Grier family.  Killigrew is seventy years old, and prosperous enough to have a cook.  He hunts foxes the old-fashioned way, which in Faulkner's Mississippi means ""squatting on a hill"" rather than riding to the hounds (27).  His and his wife's deafness means that the Grier sons can stand outside his house and hear his radio reporting on the progress of the war.</p>","Yes"
"20266","305","Belle Worsham|Eunice Habersham","Worsham, Belle|Habersham, Eunice","Worsham|Habersham, Father of Belle|Eunice","<p>Although she has two very different names in the four texts in which she appears, the character of this admirable woman - the last in Faulkner's series of redoubtable elderly women - does not change.  As Miss Belle Worsham she appears in ""Go Down, Moses"" and the chapter with that title in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the granddaughter of a man who owned slaves and the daughter of a man who left her a ""decaying house"" in Jefferson (260, 356).  She and the black Mollie Beauchamp grew up together, and remain loyal to each other decades later.  Mollie names her grandson after Belle's father, Samuel Worsham, and Belle reaches deep into her almost empty purse to help make sure that Samuel Worsham Beauchamp's body is brought home to get a proper burial in Yoknapatawpha county.  More importantly, she shares what she calls ""our grief"" with Mollie and her black family (265, 363).  In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> she is called Eunice Habersham.  There she demonstrates her loyalty to the Beauchamp family more actively, even heroically, when she joins Chick and Aleck Sander in the quest to save Molly Beauchamp's husband, Lucas, from being lynched; in that quest she repeatedly shows her grit without ever sacrificing her gentility. In all of these texts she ekes out a living by growing and selling  chickens and vegetables.  It's not clear why Faulkner decided to change her name, but she is still Eunice Habersham in her last, considerably smaller role in <em>The Town</em>, where she uses the ""home-made truck that she peddles vegetables from"" to deliver flowers to the ladies going to a dance in Jefferson (74).</p>","Yes"
"20256","304","Mrs. Eustace Grimm","Grimm, Mrs. Eustace","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> Ratliff notes that Eustace Grimm's new wife is a ""Calhoun County Doshey"" (399).  (There are no Dosheys elsewhere in the fictions.)</p>","Yes"
"20255","303","Eustace Grimm's Child","Grimm, Child of Eustace","Eustace Grimm","<p>When Eustace Grimm first appears in <em>The Hamlet</em>, he and his wife have just had a ""baby born two months ago"" (387). No other details, not even the baby's gender, are revealed, but since Eustace's mother is ""Ab Snopes' youngest sister"" (399), this child deserves a place on the Snopes family tree.</p>","Yes"
"20250","302","Old Maid Snopes","Snopes, Old Maid","Snopes 4","<p>This particular Snopes is identified in <em>The Town</em> only as the ""old maid daughter"" of the man (either Flem's father Ab or Flem's unnamed uncle) who lives in a house just close enough to Jefferson to see the town clock (136).  Also in the household are two of I.O. Snopes' children, but her relationship to them is not defined at all.  She may be Flem's sister, but more likely is another of Flem's many cousins.</p>","Yes"
"20248","301","Snopes 4","Snopes 4","Flem Snopes&#039; Grandfather","<p><em>The Mansion</em> calls this Snopes ""the last"" in the sequence of Snopeses who move from Frenchman's Bend to Jefferson, and also ""the old one"" (136).  He is extremely choleric: ""fierce eyes under a tangle of eyebrows and a neck that would begin to swell and turn red"" as soon as he felt challenged (136).  He doesn't actually move into town, but reaches a point ""in sight of the town clock"" and then refuses to go further (136), settling into a place where he can wage war against the boys who try to raid his ""water-melon patch"" (137).  Some people think he is ""Mr Flem's father"" (i.e. Ab), while others say he is ""just his uncle"" (i.e. one of Ab's unnamed brothers, 136).  Because he lives with two of I.O. Snopes' children (Bilbo and Vardaman) and they call him ""Grampaw"" (138), we are assuming he is Flem's uncle and possibly I.O.'s father, and the ""old maid daughter"" who lives with him another of Flem's many cousins  - but those are assumptions.</p>","Yes"
"20247","300","Dewitt Binford","Binford, Dewitt","","<p>According to <em>The Town</em>, ""Dewitt Binford had married another of the Snopes girls. They lived near Varner's store"" (383).  Binford and his wife contract to provide room and board for the four children of Bryon Snopes.</p>","Yes"
"20246","299","Dink Quistenberry","Quistenberry, Dink","","<p>Chick Mallison says in <em>The Town</em> that Dink ""had married one of Mr Snopes's sisters or nieces or something out at Frenchman's Bend and when Mr Snopes sent I.O. Snopes back to the country the Quistenberrys came into buy or rent or anyway run the Snopes Hotel""; he adds that ""Dink was old enough to be Mr Snopes's brother-in-law or whatever it was but he was the kind of man it just didn't occur to you to say Mister to"" (378).  The ""Mr Snopes"" in these phrases is of course Flem, but that doesn't help clarify how Flem and Quistenberry are related.</p>","Yes"
"20245","298","Unnamed ""Father"" of Eck Snopes","Unnamed ""Father"" of Eck Snopes","","<p>Neither of Eck's parents appear directly in <em>The Town</em>, but two of the novel's narrators - Ratliff and Gavin - do discuss his parentage.  Based on their contempt for 'Snopeses,' they both feel strongly that since Eck is so good a person, genetically he is ""not a Snopes"" (32).  Thus they invent this ""titular father"" for him: the imaginary man with whom Eck's mother had an affair (33).</p>","No"
"20244","297","Snopes 3","Snopes 3","","<p>This is one of the two Snopeses in <em>The Town</em> whose place in the family is impossible to determine.  He is mentioned in connection with Ab Snopes' moving into Frenchman's Bend: ""another Snopes had appeared from somewhere to take over the rented farm"" that Ab had been working (6).  Most of the Snopeses start out as tenant farmers, but there's no indication that this particular ""Snopes"" is one of the male Snopeses to whom the narrative gives a first name, though that is possible.</p>","Yes"
"20242","296","Snopes, Brother of Mink","Snopes, Brother of Mink","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Mink Snopes tells the prison warden that Montgomery Ward Snopes is ""my brother's grandson"" (99).  This is the only reference to Mink's brother in the fictions, and chronologically the possibility that a brother of Mink would have a grandchild Montgomery Ward's age is unlikely.  Ratliff asks Montgomery Ward if Mink is his ""cousin or uncle"" (71); Montgomery refuses to answer, but in his own narrative chapter he refers to Mink as ""Uncle Mink"" (103).   We are entering this man as a ""character created by another character,"" but ultimately he may be one of the many loose ends among the tangled Snopes family lines.</p>","Yes"
"20241","295","Clarence Snopes' Grandmother","Snopes, Grandmother of Clarence","","<p>In the short story ""By the People,"" Clarence Snopes' grandmother is identified as Billy Varner's ""distant cousin by marriage,"" which helps explain Varner's interest in Clarence's career (130).  (When Faulkner retells the story of Clarence as Varner's protege in <em>The Mansion</em>, his grandmother is not mentioned.)</p>","Yes"
"20240","294","Snopes 2","Snopes 2","","<p>The one member of the Snopes family who appears in ""Shingles for the Lord"" is not given a first name, and only given two minor roles to play in the story: he brings the ladder to the church in his wagon (38), and is among the members of the congregation who are there to watch as the church burns down (41).</p>","Yes"
"20239","293","Eustace Grimm","Eustace Grimm","Eustace Grimm Sr., Ab Snopes&#039; Sister","<p>When Eustace Grimm first appears in the canon, in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, he is simply someone who ""works at Snopes’ place"" (192); in that role he brings Anse the team of mules he traded for with Mr. Snopes.  He plays a more complex role in ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard"" and again in <em>The Hamlet</em>, as the ""youngish man"" in overalls with a snuff stick in his mouth"" from ""the adjoining county"" who seems to be competing with Suratt and Tull to buy the Old Frenchman place (147).  However, what Suratt and Tull don't remember until it is too late is that Grimm is an ""in-law or something"" that makes him ""kin to them Snopeses,"" in particular to Flem, who is conning them into making the purchase (150).  The account of this episode in <em>The Hamlet</em> adds the facts that he's been married a year (387), and that ""Eustace's ma was Ab Snopes' youngest sister"" (399) - making him Flem's nephew as well as his accomplice.</p>","Yes"
"20238","292","Eustace Grimm Sr.","Grimm, Eustace Sr.","","<p>Eustace Grimm's father is mentioned in <em>The Hamlet</em>, but all that the novel says is that he had two wives: the first one, Eustace's mother, is Ab Snopes' sister; the second is a ""Fite"" (399).</p>","Yes"
"20237","291","Ab Snopes' Sister","Snopes, Sister of Ab","","<p>According to another character in <em>The Hamlet</em>, ""Eustace's ma"" - that is, the mother of Eustace Grimm - ""was Ab Snopes' youngest sister"" (399).</p>","Yes"
"20236","290","Eck Snopes' Second Wife","Snopes, Second Wife of Eck","","<p>This is the second of Eck's two wives in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  He marries her six months after arriving in Frenchman's Bend. A ""big, strong, tranquil-faced young woman"" (220), she is from the family whom he meets while he and Flem are boarding at a farm outside of the village. Together Eck and his wife have three children, but they are only briefly alluded to in this novel.  No previous wife is mentioned when Eck and this woman re-appear in <em>The Town</em>; now she is the mother of both Wallstreet Panic and Admiral Dewey - who were step-brothers earlier.  When Eck dies in <em>The Town</em>, she receives a thousand dollars and invests the money in Wall's grocery store.</p>","Yes"
"20235","289","Eck Snopes' First Wife","Snopes, First Wife of Eck","","<p><em>The Hamlet</em> provides virtually no details about Eck's first wife, beyond the possibility that she died either in childbirth or soon afterward (295). She and Eck had only one son, Wallstreet Panic, although the boy did not receive any actual name for some years.</p>","Yes"
"20234","288","Unnamed Grandfather of Lump Snopes","Unnamed Grandfather of Lump Snopes","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> the man who was the father of Lump Snopes' mother is described as a ""congenital failure"" (218), living in a state of perpetual bankruptcy and fathering numerous children.</p>","Yes"
"20233","287","Lump Snopes' Mother","Snopes, Mother of Lump","Unnamed Grandfather of Lump Snopes, Lump Snopes&#039; Grandmother","<p>Described in <em>The Hamlet</em> as a ""thin, eager, plain woman who had never had quite enough to eat,"" Lump's mother grew up in a large family plagued by ""a constant succession of not even successful petty-mercantile bankruptcies"" (218). Despite her desire to better herself through education and teaching, she married a ""man under indictment"" and gave birth to a son that she named after the Arthurian knight Launcelot as an act of ""quenchless defiance"" against the grim circumstances of her life.  She died soon after.</p>","Yes"
"20232","286","Lump Snopes' Father","Snopes, Father of Lump","","<p>According to <em>The Hamlet</em>, this member of the Snopes family was under indictment for stealing a ""drummer's sample-case of shoes, all of the right foot"" (218) when he married a schoolteacher and fathered one son with her before her untimely death.</p>","Yes"
"20229","285","Lump Snopes' Grandmother","Snopes, Grandmother of Lump","","<p><em>The Hamlet</em> summarily describes Lump Snopes' grandmother as a ""whining and sluttish"" woman who keeps having children (218).</p>","Yes"
"20226","284","Snopes 1","Snopes 1","","<p>The ""Mr Snopes"" in Frenchman's Bend with whom Anse bargains for a new team of mules in <em>As I Lay Dying</em> is not given a first name (192).  According to Armstid, he owns ""three-four span[s]"" of mules (184), which suggests he is a fairly prosperous farmer, perhaps even a landlord.   According to Eustace Grimm, who ""works Snopes' place,"" this farmer is the nephew of Flem Snopes (192) - if so, he is Flem's only nephew or niece in the fictions. Faulkner may be thinking of Flem himself, though in the earlier <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Flem has been living in Jefferson for several decades.</p>","Yes"
"20225","283","Invalid Snopes","Snopes, Invalid","","<p>After referring to the ""incoming Snopeses"" as a group, the narrator of <em>Flags in the Dust</em> singles out one to individualize: ""there was one, an invalid of some sort, who operated a second-hand peanut parcher"" (167).  A ""parcher"" is a pushcart for roasting and selling peanuts on the street.  (This may be the fictions' first mention of Eck Snopes.  In <em>The Town</em>; Eck works as a watchman who wears a neck brace and is liked by ""all the boys"" in Jefferson because ""he kept a meal sack full of raw peanuts"" that he would share with them by the ""handful"" (116).  Almost three decades separate these novels and the peanuts in the parcher from the raw peanuts in Eck's sack, but this might be an example of how Faulkner's imagination kept his cast of characters alive over the course of his career.)</p>","Yes"
"20202","282","Barton Kohl","Kohl, Barton","","<p>According to Ratliff, the Greenwich Village sculptor who marries Linda Snopes is ""not big, he jest looked big, like a football player"" (190), and his ""pale eyes"" looked at you ""missing nothing"" (191).  Several characters in <em>The Mansion</em> make it a point to mention that he is Jewish.  Like so many of the southern men in the other fictions, however, Barton Kohl goes off to fight in a civil war - the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s.  He is killed there while serving with the Loyalists.</p>","No"
"20201","281","Watkins Products Snopes","Snopes, Watkins Products","","<p>Another Snopes who appears for the first time in the last novel of the Snopes trilogy, Watkins Products Snopes is the carpenter and kinsman whom Flem hires to renovate the house that was formerly owned by Manfred de Spain; it is Wat's work, along with Flem's ambitions, that create 'the mansion' of the novel's title.  He is named for a real company that has sold health products since 1868.  His exact relationship to Flem or any of the other Snopeses is never specified.</p>","Yes"
"20200","280","Three Unspecified Snopeses","Snopes, Three Unspecified","","<p>During Flem's funeral at the end of <em>The Mansion</em>, Gavin Stevens notices three people whom he has never seen before, and he knows almost immediately that ""they are Snopeses,"" with ""country faces"" that make him think of ""wolves come to look at the trap where another bigger wolf . . . died"" (463).  These are the last members of the family Faulkner creates, and as an anonymous group they seem meant to suggest how futile is the effort to defeat 'Snopesism.'</p>","Yes"
"20199","279","Mink Snopes' Step-Mother","Snopes, Step-Mother of Mink","","<p>In <em>The Mansion</em> Mink Snopes describes ""the lady that raised me"" as ""jest"" the wife of his father, and ""no kin a-tall"" to Mink himself (110). ""Because she was a Christian"" - a phrase that is meant to convey her self-righteousness - she regularly took him to church services and prayer meetings (117). She ""always failed"" Mink as a surrogate mother, but the novel has some sympathy for her as a battered wife: ""a gaunt harried slattern of a woman . . . always either with a black eye or holding a dirty rag to her bleeding"" (117).</p>","Yes"
"20198","278","Orestes Snopes","Snopes, Orestes","","<p>Orestes is one of the last Snopeses added to the family tree.  He appears late in <em>The Mansion</em> as ""a new Snopes living in Jefferson"" (354).  Also called Res, his exact relationship to Flem is never made clear.  Flem establishes him in the converted carriage house on the Compson place, which Flem now owns, where the hog farm Res operates becomes a source of increasingly violent friction with his neighbor.</p>","Yes"
"20197","277","Snopes, Mother of Eck","Snopes, Mother of Eck","","<p>The mother of Eck is mentioned in <em>The Hamlet</em> because when Eck's first wife dies, Eck leaves their son, Wallstreet Panic, with his mother to raise, but she plays that role outside the narrative.  She is also mentioned in the other two volumes in the Snopes trilogy, again in terms of something that happens outside the narrative, if it happens at all.  Because Eck is such a good and generous person, in <em>The Town</em> Gavin Stevens declares that he 'must' be illegitimate, that his mother was committing adultery with someone not named Snopes when he was conceived.  In <em>The Mansion</em>, it is Montgomery Ward Snopes who asserts the same thing.  But neither novel provides any evidence to support this assertion; it can tell us something about what 'Snopes' means, even to members of the family, but it tells us nothing about Eck's mother.</p>","Yes"
"19808","276","Beauchamp, Grandchildren of Lucas","Beauchamp, Grandchildren of Lucas","Samuel Beauchamp&#039;s Mother","<p>These ""grandchildren"" of Lucas Beauchamp are mentioned only in the short story ""A Point of Law,"" and the one reference to them there is ambiguous.  ""He had one daughter with grandchildren"" (214) - this could mean that the grandchildren are his daughter's instead of his.  No other details about them, or about Lucas' larger family, are given in this short story.  (When Faulkner revised the story into the ""Fire and the Hearth"" chapter of <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the phrase ""one daughter with grandchildren"" was omitted.)</p>","Yes"
"19782","275","Thucydides McCaslin","McCaslin, Thucydides","Phoebe, Roscius","<p>The slave Thucydides/Thucydus only appears in the novel <em>Go Down, Moses</em> by way of the McCaslin plantation ledgers, but the story outlined there is striking.  He is the son of Roskus and Fibby and the husband who marries Eunice in the same year she is made pregnant by Old Carothers McCaslin, the white man who owns all four of these slaves.  He was born in North Carolina.  In his will Old Carothers bequeaths him land, but like Ike McCaslin, Thucydides renounces this inheritance.  Instead, according to the ledgers, he chooses ""to stay [on the plantation] and work it out"" - i.e. earn enough money to buy himself out of slavery (253).  Five years later he can buy his freedom, and with the additional $200 he has earned he moves to Jefferson, and sets up shop as a blacksmith.  In what the narrator calls ""the final entry"" on him, Buck McCaslin writes his name as ""Thucydus McCaslin"" (253); Thucydus himself may have decided to appropriate his former owner's last name, or this use of ""McCaslin"" may be meant to suggest that, like other slaves, he was an illegitimate child of Old Carothers - though that is speculative.  He dies in Jefferson in 1854.</p>","Yes"
"19781","274","Ike McCaslin's Children","McCaslin, Children of Ike","Isaac McCaslin","<p>These unnamed children of Ike McCaslin appear only briefly, and enigmatically, in the magazine version of ""Delta Autumn,"" where it says that Ike ""had had a wife and children once though no more"" (274).  <em>Go Down, Moses</em> begins by saying that Ike McCaslin was childless, and when Faulkner revised this story for that novel these children disappear.</p>","Yes"
"19780","273","Unnamed Enslaved Grandmother of Ned McCaslin","Unnamed Enslaved Grandmother of Ned McCaslin","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em>, Ned McCaslin's grandmother is identified only as ""a Negro slave"" who belonged to Lucius McCaslin (31).  According to McCaslin family lore, and Ned himself, she was impregnated by the white man who owned her, Old Carothers McCaslin.</p>","Yes"
"19779","272","Unnamed Father of Samuel Worsham Beauchamp","Unnamed Father of Samuel Worsham Beauchamp","","<p>In ""Go Down, Moses"" and again the the chapter with that title in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Samuel Beauchamp's father ""deserted him"" when he was born and is ""now in the state penitentiary for manslaughter"" (258, 354).  This ""father who begot and deserted him"" is described as ""not only violent but bad""; Gavin Stevens, a white man, believes the ""seed"" this man planted in his son is the cause of his criminality, though Samuel's black grandmother blames the white landlord Roth Edmonds for her grandson's behavior (258, 354).</p>","Yes"
"19778","271","James Beauchamp's Daughter","Beauchamp, Daughter of James Beauchamp","Tennie&#039;s Jim|James Beauchamp","<p>Like Nat Beauchamp in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, Roth's mistress - James Beauchamp’s unnamed granddaughter in the revised version of ""Delta Autumn"" Faulkner published in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> - has an aunt in Vicksburg with whom she stays.  This unnamed aunt is a widow who takes in washing to support her family.  For someone like Ike McCaslin, raised in the culture of the Jim Crow South, ""taking in washing"" is enough to identify this woman, and her very light-skinned niece, as black.  (The almost identical 'aunt' in the short story version of ""Delta Autumn"" is not a member of the McCaslin-Beauchamp-Edmonds family.)</p>","No"
"19732","270","Stevens, Grandfather of Gavin","Stevens, Grandfather of Gavin","","<p>The Stevenses are one of the older Yoknapatawpha families, but there is confusion about its earlier members.  The first appearance of a Stevens is in ""A Rose for Emily""; he is the eighty-year-old mayor of Jefferson referred to as ""Judge Stevens"" (122).  According to Brooks, Dasher and Kirk, three of the scholars who create charts or indices of Faulkner's characters, this man is the same Judge Stevens who is Gavin's father in half a dozen other fictions.  Given this man's age, however, it seems more likely that (as the scholar Edmond Volpe has it) he is the grandfather of Gavin mentioned in <em>Light in August</em> who ""owned slaves"" before the Civil War and who  ""publicly congratulated"" Colonel Sartoris for killing the Bundrens during Reconstruction (444), and on that basis we create this separate entry for him in our index.  His only other mention in the canon occurs in ""Knight's Gambit,"" where Charles Mallison (Gavin's nephew) thinks about the books on the shelves in the home the family still lives in as the ones ""his grandfather had . . . heired in his turn from his father"" (149).</p>","Yes"
"19730","269","Miss Harriss","Harriss, Miss","Harriss, Melisandre Backus Stevens","<p>Like her mother, the 20-year-old daughter of ""Mrs. Harriss"" never gets a first name in ""Knight's Gambit,"" the only text in which she has a significant presence.  In other respects too she takes after her mother: ""looking not wan so much as delicate and fragile and not even fragile so much as cold, evanescent, like one of the stalked white early spring flowers bloomed ahead of its time into the snow and the ice and doomed before your eyes without even knowing that it was dying, feeling not even any pain"" (190–91).  Unlike her mother but very like her brother, Max, Miss Harriss has been spoiled.  Not unwilling to fight her rival, Miss Cayley, Miss Harriss eventually gets her man in Sebastian Gualdres.  When Gavin Stevens marries the widowed Mrs. Harriss, Mrs. Gualdres becomes one of Steven’s ""stepchildren"" (238).  Although readers never see her in that role, she is mentioned, but again not named, in <em>The Mansion</em>.</p>","Yes"
"19729","268","Max Harriss","Harriss, Max","Harriss, Melisandre Backus Stevens","<p>In ""Knight's Gambit,"" the one text in which he has a significant presence, Max Harriss is the twenty-one-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Harriss (nee Melisandre Backus).  Gavin Stevens calls Max ""the rich young earl"" (192).  As a son he takes after his gangster father; in a sense, the eyes have it: despite his ""delicate face,"" there is ""nothing delicate about the eyes"" (143).  Max is the older of ""two spoiled children [born] a year apart"" (148).  As an older brother, Max seems over-protective of his sister along lines that Quentin Compson would have recognized, but his real concern is with the man who he thinks is courting his mother, Sebastian Guladres, who beats him at everything - horses, fencing, women - that the young Yoknapatawphian thinks he has mastered.  In the story, Max's resentment gives birth to a particularly original scheme for murder. After it fails, Stevens coerces him into enlisting in the army, and after Stevens marries the widowed Mrs. Harriss, Max becomes one of Steven’s ""stepchildren"" (238) - though he never appears in that role in a text.  He is mentioned, however, though not named, in both <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>.</p>","Yes"
"19728","267","Harriss","Harriss","","<p>The first husband of the woman whom Gavin Stevens eventually marries is a bootlegger from New Orleans named only Mr. Harriss.  Faulkner describes his offstage death memorably in three different texts: in ""Knight's Gambit"" he dies at his desk, ""maybe,"" ""because you can be shot just as discreetly across a desk in an office as anywhere else"" (167–68); in <em>The Town</em>, he is brought back to Yoknapatawpha from New Orleans in ""a bullet-proof hearse"" (187); in <em>The Mansion</em>, he dies in a barber's chair, of ""his ordinary thirty-eight calibre occupational disease"" (218) - i.e. getting shot by another gangster.  The two novels only mention him briefly.  As a living character, he is described in the most detail in ""Knight's Gambit.""  He's  ""a man whom nobody in that part of Mississippi had ever heard of before"" who marries the daughter of a local plantation owner (150).  ""He was more than twice her age, old enough himself to be her father - a big florid affable laughing man about whom you noticed at once that his eyes were not laughing too; noticed so quickly that his eyes were not laughing too that you realised only later that the laughter never had gone much further than his teeth; - a man who had what his uncle called the Midas touch, who as his uncle said, walked in an aura of pillaged widows and minors as some men walk in that of failure or death"" (153).  He achieves a pseudo-aristocratic status among the bootleggers and gangsters that Prohibition made possible:  ""Baron Harriss"" (220), as he becomes known, is ""no petty furtive peddling of pint bottles in hotel barbershops"" (157).  After his father-in-law's death he turns the plantation into a parvenu's palace.</p>","Yes"
"19726","265","Great Aunt of Charles Mallison","Stevens, Great Aunt of Charles","","<p>Charles Mallison's ""great aunt"" is one of several ""aunts"" in the canon that are hard to place on a family tree.  She is mentioned in ""Knight's Gambit,"" in a sentence about Mrs. Harriss: she has ""spent ten years among what his great-aunt would have called the crowned heads of Europe"" (168).  There's no way to tell from the story, or from the larger history of the Stevens family in the Yoknapatawpha fictions, if she is related to Charles' mother or his father.</p>","No"
"19703","264","Maury Bascomb","Bascomb, Maury","Damuddy Bascomb","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Maury Bascomb is the brother of Caroline Bascomb Compson. For much of the Compson children's early life he lives in their home and regularly partakes of their father's whiskey; by 1928 he has moved away, but continues regularly to ask his sister for money. Benjy was originally named ""Maury"" in his honor.  He also has an affair with the Compsons' next door neighbor, Mrs. Patterson. When the affair is revealed, Mr. Patterson beats Uncle Maury - or as Benjy puts it, ""His eye was sick, and his mouth"" (43).  He is not mentioned by name in the ""Appendix"" to the novel that Faulkner wrote in 1945, only as the ""only brother"" of the Compson children's mother (340): ""a handsome flashing swaggering workless bachelor who borrowed money from almost anyone"" (340).</p>","Yes"
"19702","263","Quentin Compson's Aunt","Compson, Aunt of Quentin","","<p>Like the enigmatic aunt of (Old) Bayard Sartoris in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, this aunt of Quentin Compson is hard to place on the family tree.  She appears only, abruptly, in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> when Mr. Compson uses her to explain to his son Quentin something about the nature of women:  this aunt - whom apparently neither of these males ever saw - is locked in what Mr. Compson calls one of those  ""inexplicable (to the man mind) amicable enmities"" with ""her nearest female kin"" (156).  It's possible that this aunt is a Bascomb rather than a Compson; Bascomb is Quentin's mother's maiden name.</p>","No"

According to Falls' story, she is ""a full-blood Sartoris,"" but this is the only time Faulkner's fiction mentions her existence.  (In <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Faulkner's later stories about the Sartorises during the Civil War, the female relative who lives at Sartoris is Rosa Millard, John's mother-in-law and Bayard's grandmother.)</p>","Yes"

As a grown man, he becomes the government's local Indian agent and marries a Chickasaw woman who is the granddaughter of either Issetibbeha (202; 7) or (in <em>Requiem</em>'s second mention of the event, of Mohataha, 170).  Although the circumstances are vague, it seems clear that in the novel he becomes an outspoken advocate for the tribe he marries into, resigning from his government position ""in a letter of furious denunciation addressed to the President of the United States himself""  - probably Andrew Jackson; afterward he moves to Oklahoma ""with his wife's dispossessed people"" (7).</p>","Yes"

At least two sisters are alive and living with him and his father in Virginia when, at 14, he runs away from home (192).  But there must have been more: at least, Quentin tells Shreve that, because of the ""dampness"" and heat in the Tidewater, ""sisters and brothers"" get sick ""after supper and die before the next meal"" (184).

""The two older boys"" - Sutpen's older brothers - have left the family before it moves to the Virginia plantation (181), but they are not his only male siblings: Quentin tells Shreve that, because of the ""dampness"" and heat in the Tidewater, ""sisters and brothers"" get sick ""after supper and die before the next meal"" (184).  Even allowing for hyperbole, this implies that there must have been at least one or two brothers besides the two older ones.</p>","No"
"19448","257","Thomas Sutpen's Sister 2","Sutpen, Sister of Thomas 2","Thomas Sutpen&#039;s Father, Thomas Sutpen&#039;s Mother","<p>Based on the phrase ""one of the sisters"" in <em>Absalom!</em>, we can say that Thomas Sutpen has at least two sisters (185).  This entry is not the sister who gets pregnant, twice, during the family's trip from the mountains to the Tidewater region of Virginia.  Sister(2) may be the one who altered their father's hand-me-down clothes to fit the young Thomas (185), or she may be the sister who refuses to ""give way"" to a rich family's carriage (187), or she may be the sister whom Thomas sees still later, after he has been turned away from the big house, as ""shapeless in a calico dress and a pair of old man's shoes unlaced and flapping about her bare ankles and broad in the beam as a cow"" (191).  From the text, however, we cannot say for sure if Sister(2) does any or all of these things.</p>","No"
"19206","254","Unnamed Step-Father of Had-Two-Fathers","Unnamed Step-Father of Had-Two-Fathers","","<p>In both the 1940 magazine version of ""The Old People"" and the revised version of it that Faulkner published in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the step-father of Had-Two-Fathers is ""one of the slaves which [Doom] inherited"" from Moketubbe (the story, 203).  After impregnating a slave woman from New Orleans, Doom ""pronounces a marriage"" between her and ""one of the slave men he has just inherited"" upon becoming ""The Man"" (the novel, 158).  But this man's place on the family tree is ambiguous.  In the magazine version it seems more likely that this man is Sam Fathers' grandfather rather than his father, and that the character in the story with 'two fathers' is actually Sam's father.  In the novel Faulkner clears up this ambiguity.</p>","Yes"
"19205","255","Unnamed Son of Ikkemotubbe","Unnamed Son of Ikkemotubbe","Ikkemotubbe","<p>This character is one of the more elusive in Faulkner's fiction.  The <em>Harpers Magazine</em> version of ""The Old People"" creates an ambiguity when it says that ""almost a hundred years ago"" Ikkemotubbe sold ""his own son"" to a white planter, the great-grandfather of the narrator on whose farm Sam lived for most of his life (203).  Since Sam is ""seventy"" years old (202), he could not be this man, and  would have to be this man's son.  If we accept the story's chronological references, then, this character is the illegitimate son of Ikkemotubbe and an unnamed ""slave woman"" who was bought in New Orleans (202).  He is also the sole father of Sam Had-Two-Fathers, which makes Sam's name - ""Had-Two-Fathers"" - a family name that Sam inherited from <em>this</em> enslaved father.  Faulkner resolved the confusion when he revised ""The Old People"" for inclusion in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>; there Ikkemotubbe is Sam's biological father rather than grandfather.</p>","Yes"
"19203","253","Unnamed Grandmother of Boon Hogganbeck","Unnamed Grandmother of Boon Hogganbeck","","<p>Boon's ""mother's mother,"" as <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> puts it, was ""a Chickasaw woman"" (91).  Five texts refer to this grandmother, though she herself never appears in any of them.  In the first mention, in ""Lion,"" there's some uncertainty about whether she might have been his mother instead: as Quentin puts it, ""Boon was part Indian.  They said half, but I don't think so.  I think it was the grandmother who was the Chickasaw woman, niece of the chief who once owned the land Major de Spain now owned and over which we hunted"" (184).  In the other texts there's no doubt about her place on the Hogganbeck family tree, but her status among the Chickasaws is uncertain: Quentin's description locates her among the tribe's chiefs, and in <em>The Reivers</em> Boon himself sometimes claims his grandmother was related to ""Issetibbeha himself"" (18).  But the narrator of that novel discounts the claim, and in ""The Old People"" and <em>Go Down, Moses</em> the 'Indian blood' that runs in Boon's veins is explicitly described as ""not chief's blood"" (203, 160).  Given the preoccupation with 'blood' in the fictions - in terms of both race and class - just how 'Indian' and how 'noble' Faulkner imagined Boon to be is potentially a significant issue.  But there is no fixed point from which to explore it.</p>","Yes"
"19202","252","Boon Hogganbeck","Hogganbeck, Boon","Unnamed Mother of Boon Hogganbeck","<p>The character of Boon Hogganbeck is essentially the same in all seven of his appearances in the fiction, though in one of them (""The Bear"") his name is Hoggenbeck, and his lineage changes in another.  In every text he has an Indian grandmother, but when he first appears, in ""Lion,"" she is a ""Chickasaw woman, niece of the chief who once owned the land"" (184).  Beginning with his next appearance, in ""The Old People,"" Faulkner lowers her rank: Boon's blood, the narrator says, ""is not a chief's blood"" (203).  He lives as ""a white man,"" but of a much lower class than the aristocratic De Spains and McCaslins and Priests whom he serves as a kind of factotum, especially during hunting trips into the wilderness.  He is almost always depicted against the background of the woods and hunting, though in his last appearance, his most important, as a major character in Faulkner's last novel, <em>The Reivers</em>, the plot takes him into Memphis and ultimately into marriage.  The description of him there sums up his character well: ""tough, faithful, brave and completely unreliable; he was six feet four inches tall and weighed two hundred and forty pounds and had the mentality of a child"" (18).  In a kind of Faulknerian paradox, it is Boon (whose terrible aim with guns is legendary) who kills Old Ben, the mythic bear of ""The Bear"" and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.</p>","Yes"
"19199","250","Unnamed Cousin of Doom","Unnamed Cousin of Doom","Unnamed Uncle of Doom","<p>In Faulkner's first two stories about the Indians who live in Yoknapatawpha when the white settlers begin arriving, neither the chief of the tribe (The Man) nor his son are  named. In the patriarchal society Faulkner imagines, this son is heir to the title The Man - and as the son of The Man's sister, his cousin Doom is out of the line of succession.  In ""Red Leaves"" both The Man and his son die mysteriously after Doom returns from a sojourn in New Orleans.  In ""A Justice"" Doom's responsibility for their deaths is made explicit.  (In the later versions of this story, Doom is named Ikkemotubbe, his uncle The Man is Issetibbeha - who is Doom's son in ""Red Leaves"" - and his cousin, the son of the man, is Moketubbe.)</p>","Yes"
"19198","249","Unnamed Uncle of Doom","Unnamed Uncle of Doom","","<p>In Faulkner's first two stories about the Indians who inhabit Yoknapatawpha in its early history, he does not name the man who is ""The Man,"" the hereditary chief of the tribe.  His sister is the mother of Doom.  In ""Red Leaves,"" The Man and his son both die shortly after Doom returns from a sojourn in New Orleans - presumably at Doom's hands, but that part of the story is left untold here.  It is told in ""A Justice,"" which describes him as ""getting old"" by the time Doom leaves for New Orleans (346), and ""not very glad"" when Doom returns seven years later (349) - for good reason: Doom returns with poison, the Man and his son both ""act strange"" at their food, and ""so Doom was the Man"" (349).  (When Faulkner re-tells this story in later fictions, The Man, Doom's uncle, is named Issetibbeha - the name of Doom's son in ""A Justice"" - and The Man's son, Doom's cousin, is Moketubbe.)</p>","Yes"
"19117","248","Admiral Dewey Snopes","Snopes, Admiral Dewey","Eckrum Snopes","<p>Ad - Admiral Dewey Snopes - is one of Eck Snopes' children.  He was named after a hero of the Spanish-American War.  In the Snopes trilogy his character is largely absorbed in the story of his older brother, Wallstreet Panic Snopes, though like Eck and Wallstreet, his decent, hard-working nature belies the stereotype implied in the term 'Snopesism.'  His most memorable appearance is his first, in the short story ""Spotted Horses""; there he is named, simply, Ad, a young boy ""a yard tall maybe, in overhalls,"" who bravely tries to help his father catch the pony they bought at the auction (175).  He is almost run down by the horse, but at the last minute, to quote the vernacular storyteller, ""that horse swoared over his head without touching a hair"" (175).  (When Faulkner revised this episode for inclusion in <em>The Hamlet</em>, the role of Ad is played instead by Wallstreet.)</p>","Yes"
"19116","247","Mrs. Wallstreet Panic Snopes","Snopes, Mrs. Wallstreet Panic","","<p>Although the wife of Wallstreet Panic Snopes is never named in <em>The Town</em>, she is memorably characterized.  When she first appears at school in Jefferson, the teacher, Miss Vaiden Wyott, instructs Wall that ""this is she. Marry her.""  He does. His wife is described as a ""tense fierce not quite plain-faced girl . . . and a will if anything even more furious"" than Gavin's in opposing the rest of the Snopeses (154).</p>","Yes"
"19115","246","Wallstreet Panic Snopes","Snopes, Wallstreet Panic","Eckrum Snopes","<p>Wallstreet Panic Snopes - given his absurd name absurdly, in the hopes that it might mean he'll get rich, but more often called ""Wall"" in the fictions - is a very young ""little periwinkle-eyed boy"" when he first appears in <em>The Hamlet</em> (304).  He appears in all three volumes of the Snopes trilogy, and his eyes are still ""an incredible tender youthful periwinkle blue"" at the end of <em>The Mansion</em> (461).  By then he <em>is</em> rich, the very successful owner of a chain of ""wholesale grocery establishments blanketing half of Mississippi and Tennessee and Arkansas"" (461) living in Memphis.  His story provides a counterpoint to the rise of Flem from sharecropper's cabin to that mansion.  The son of Eck Snopes, Wall began in a cabin too, but while Flem gets rich by ruthlessly exploiting other people, Wall succeeds, as a narrator in <em>The Mansion</em> puts it, ""by the outrageous unSnopesish method of jest selling ever body exactly what they thought they was buying, for exactly what they thought they was going to pay for it"" (170).  He is helped by his wife, who detests Flem and makes sure her husband never takes any help from him.  Instead, Wall believes in education, works hard, is willing to innovate, and builds his business slowly but steadily.  Throughout his rise, various narrators keep saying in one way or another Wall ""was never a Snopes, never in this world a Snopes,"" as one of them puts it in <em>The Town</em> (152).  But perhaps the better way to read him is as a reminder that judging people by extraneous criteria like their name, even if its Snopes, is wrong.</p>","Yes"
"19114","245","Eckrum Snopes","Snopes, Eckrum","","<p>Eck Snopes is one of Flem's cousins, though the narrator of ""Spotted Horses,"" the first text in which Eck appears, tells us that ""Flem would skin Eck quick as he would ere a one of us"" (168) - and in the story he does. Eck acquires two of the Texas ponies, but loses both of them the same day; he even manages, in his hapless attempt to catch one of them, to break its neck. In the Snopes trilogy he fails again, and again, as a blacksmith, a mill worker, a restaurant cook and a watchman, but his failures are all admirable. He breaks his own neck saving the life of a Negro mill hand, and dies while helping a distraught mother try to find a missing child.  Eck's honesty, generosity and decency challenge the stereotype of 'Snopesism,' as characters in the trilogy notice.  In <em>The Mansion</em>, his own cousin Montgomery Ward calls Eck and his family ""our shame"": they ""dont belong to us"" (93).  Ratliff and Stevens go further: in <em>The Town</em> they speculate that Eck's mother must have been committing adultery when Eck was conceived: Eck is ""indubitably and indefensibily not a Snopes"" (33).  But there's no evidence to support this.  It seems more likely that Eck's existence is meant as a reminder against imposing stereotypes on people, even Snopeses.  Eck is the father of Wallstreet Panic and Admirable Dewey, both admirable too.</p>","Yes"
"19113","244","Launcelot|Lump Snopes","Snopes, Launcelot|Lump","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em>, which has the most to say about Lump, Ratliff calls him ""that Snopes encore"" (218); he is referring to the fact that Lump takes his cousin Flem's place as clerk in the Varner store when Flem moves on up to Jefferson.  His mother called Lump ""Launcelot,"" surely one of the more egregious ironies in the Snopes' chronicles: as Ratliff elaborates, she chose the name of a Knight of the Round Table because she believed in the ""honor and pride and salvation and hope"" she had found ""between the pages of books"" (218).  Lump, on the other hand, is as dishonest and unscrupulous as Flem, and probably even more distasteful.  Among his various venalities in that novel, he exploits another of his cousins by removing a plank from Mrs. Littlejohn's barn and charging other men to watch Ike Snopes having sex with a cow.  He may be the unnamed clerk at Varner's who appears in ""The Hound.""  It is as that clerk that he makes a minor figure in <em>The Mansion</em>.</p>","Yes"
"19112","243","Virgil Snopes","Snopes, Virgil","Wesley Snopes","<p>The biography of Virgil Snopes is one of the more unusual, even among the various Snopeses.  When he first appears, in <em>Sanctuary</em>, he provides an occasion for comedy rather than alarm, as a sexually very naive young man who, on his first trip to the big city of Memphis, mistakes a brothel for a boarding house, and the prostitutes for the surprisingly large family of the landlady, Miss Reba.  His friend and fellow babe-in-the-wood Fonzo takes him to another brothel, but afterwards Virgil complains about having to pay three dollars for something ""you caint tote off with you"" (196). When Clarence Snopes, his older relative, discovers him in Reba's, he calls him ""the biggest fool this side of Jackson"" (198).  He is only mentioned in <em>The Town</em>, but in <em>The Mansion</em> he becomes the unlikely star in a pornographic narrative when his extraordinary sexual stamina becomes a way for him and Clarence to make a lot of money.  Faulkner describes his capabilities in comic and euphemistic terms.  He is the son of Wesley and the brother of Virgil, but those genealogical details never become important.</p>","Yes"

He never indicates the sex of this child, perhaps because he cannot determine it himself - or perhaps to emphasize the strangeness of the four as a group.

"19102","234","Clarence Snopes","Snopes, Clarence","Mrs. I.O. Snopes 2, I.O. Snopes","<p>On the Snopes family tree, Clarence - according to <em>The Mansion</em>, it's ""pronounced 'Cla'nce'"" (325) - is the son of I.O. and the half-brother of Montgomery Ward Snopes.  He is one of the four Snopes named in Faulkner's first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, but appears only as the boy whose ""hulking but catlike presence"" makes Bryon Snopes nervous (235).  It is in <em>Sanctuary</em> that his character as one of the most venal Snopeses emerges.  It is ten years later, Clarence has become Yoknapatawpha's State Senator on the strength of his family's influence in the modern South, ""without recourse to a public polling,"" and his ""vast, puffy face without any mark of age or thought whatever"" is also frequently seen in the bordellos of Memphis (173).  In one of them he discovers the whereabouts of Temple Drake, and sells that information three times: to Horace Benbow, to Temple's father and to Popeye's Memphis lawyer - thus becoming the link between the Memphis and Jefferson parts of the novel's plot. Horace does pay him, but tries to keep Senator Snopes from getting any closer to the Benbow house than the front gate.  In the late short story ""By the People"" and again in the last two volumes of the Snopes trilogy Faulkner develops Clarence's biography in more sordid detail.  The narrator of the short story treats Clarence's rise as a nightmare perversion of the American dream.  As a young member of the Snopes clan in Frenchman's Bend, he led a gang of ""cousins and toadies"" who ""fought and drank and beat Negroes and terrified young girls"" (89), until Billy Varner had him appointed a constable.  While working for the law, he joined and became a leader of the ""Ku Klux Klan"" (130), until for political reasons he became ""its mortal enemy"" (131).  Loyal only to his own ambitions, he joins another white supremacist organization called ""the Silver Shirts"" while also teaching a Sunday School class in the Baptist Church (132).  Clarence ""uses and betrays and makes capital of everything he ever touched"" (138).  Most pointedly, his success as a demagogue epitomizes the dark side of government ""by the people.""  After 25 years in the state legislature, he is as ""ruthless"" and ambitious as ever (132), running for the U.S. Congress by exploiting the racism of his culture.  Faulkner retells this story in <em>The Mansion</em>, but first, in <em>The Town</em>, he arranges for Clarence to be ""the only Snopes or resident of Frenchman's Bend or Yoknapatawpha County either for that matter"" to welcome Byron Snopes' wild children - who in turn try to burn him at the stake (387).</p>","Yes"

After faking a heart condition to evade the draft, Monty had accompanied Horace Benbow to World War I as a non-combatant working with the Y.M.C.A. With ""fine cold distaste,"" Horace calls him a ""parasite"" but refuses to say any more about him (167).  Faulkner had a lot more to say, though.  Montgomery Ward is an unnamed six-month-old child in Frenchman's Bend in <em>The Hamlet</em>, but has quite a career in the second two volumes of the Snopes trilogy.  According to <em>The Town</em>, while he was in France with Benbow and the Y.M.C.A. he found a non-regulation way to serve the troops, opening up a couple brothels.  From France he brought a collection of pornographic photos to Jefferson and opened the ""Atelier Monty,"" secretly serving a large clientele of men from Yoknapatawpha and beyond while posing as a photographic studio.  When he is caught, he spends time in prison where, at Flem's behest, he makes sure their cousin Mink stays behind bars by playing a demeaning trick on him.  That story is told in <em>The Mansion</em>, where Monty actually gets to narrate a chapter in his own voice, the only Snopes given that privilege in the canon.  After his release, in what must be considered a comment on all the time Faulkner himself worked in the Hollywood, Monty is last seen working in Hollywood for the film industry.</p>","Yes"

A son of I.O. Snopes from his first marriage, he appears only in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  (The names of the various Snopeses come from a variety of sources; Saint Elmo's name comes from the title of an 1866 novel by Georgia author Augusta Jane Evans.)</p>","Yes"
"19099","231","Mrs. I.O. Snopes 2","Snopes, Mrs. I.O. 2","","<p>Faulkner's decision in <em>The Town</em> to make I.O. Snopes a bigamist complicates the identity of the various characters who appear as his wife.  The first such character appears in the first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, as a ""placid mountain of a woman"" who spends her days in the porch swing of their ""small frame house"" - ""not doing anything: just swinging"" (235).  Her son is named Clarence. If we work backwards from the Snopes trilogy, this woman becomes I.O.'s second wife, described very differently in <em>The Town</em> when Ratliff says she ""wasn't a big girl"" (39).  In Ratliff's account she is  not just ""Clarence Snopes' maw"" (384), but also the mother of the twins Vardaman and Bilbo, and ""Miz Vernon Tull's sister's niece by marriage"" (39).  At the end of the novel she rouses the men at Varner's store to rescue her son from ""Them Indians!"" - as she refers to Byron's children; Ratliff credits her ""mother love and mother instinct"" for knowing that her son's life was in danger (388).</p>","Yes"
"19098","230","Mrs. I.O. Snopes 1","Snopes, Mrs. I.O. 1","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> I.O. Snopes calls himself ""a single man, unfortunately"" (225), but to the surprise of Frenchman's Bend, three years after he arrived in the hamlet he turns out to have a wife, a ""big gray-colored woman"" (292). When she appears with ""a baby six months old"" in a carriage, I.O. ""takes one look at that buggy"" and vanishes (293). Her character is not developed further in this novel.   In the next novel in the Snopes trilogy, <em>The Town</em>, it turns out that she is only one of I.O.'s wives - he is a <em>twice</em>-married man, i.e. a bigamist.  In this novel her child is identified as Montgomery Ward Snopes, and as part of the migration of Snopeses into Jefferson she becomes the proprietor of the Snopes Hotel.  (In the much earlier <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, however, the Snopes who takes over the hotel is Clarence's mother - who according to <em>The Town</em> would be I.O.'s second wife.)</p>","Yes"
"19097","229","I.O. Snopes","Snopes, I.O.","","<p>I.O. Snopes' career as a character begins with the first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, and after six more appearances ends three decades later in <em>The Mansion</em>.  In those eight texts his various jobs include restaurant manager, cotton speculator, mule trader, blacksmith and schoolteacher.  In all of these contexts he is both comically out of place and nonetheless vaguely alarming - and impossible to get into a single focus, as Faulkner re-invents him more than once.  He begins as a minor figure in three of the first four novels and an early short story, but is a central character as the unscrupulous mule trader in ""Mule in the Yard,"" willing to sacrifice both mules and Mrs. Hait's husband in his efforts to scam the insurance company.  And he is one of the most memorable of the many Snopeses in the first two novels in the Snopes trilogy.  In <em>The Hamlet</em> it surprises the people of Frenchman's Bend when he turns out to have a wife and child; in <em>The Town</em> folks are even more surprised to learn that he has two wives at the same time, and six children altogether.  He exasperates Ratliff and Stevens in their roles as narrators and moral spokesmen in the trilogy, but Faulkner actually seems fond of him, especially of his ability to mangle the English language and its stock of proverbial expressions.  In <em>The Mansion</em> he appears mostly in Montgomery Ward Snopes' chapter, which refers several times to ""mine and Clarence's father I.O."" (97); Ratliff provides a kind of closure to his story when he says that ""four years ago Flem had cidevanted I.O. back to Frenchman's Bend for good"" (169-70).  The fictions never say what I.O. stands for, but some scholars have suggested it's ""Initials Only.""</p>","Yes"
"19096","228","Wesley Snopes","Snopes, Wesley","","<p>Wesley Snopes is the father of Virgil and Byron.  He appears as ""the actual Snopes schoolmaster"" instead of by name in <em>The Town</em> (42) and by name in <em>The Mansion</em>.  In both novels, in addition to being the schoolmaster in Frenchman's Bend, he is a religious figure, a ""revival song-leader"" (<em>Mansion</em>, 79) ""whose stage and scene were the scattered country churches and creeks and horse-ponds where during the hot summer Sundays revival services and baptisings took place"" (<em>Town</em>, 43).  According to the first novel, he does have ""a good baritone voice and probably the last working pitch pipe in north Mississippi"" (43), but in every other respect he is equally unfit for teaching and preaching.  In both novels he leaves Frenchman's Bend after ""a posse of enraged fathers caught him and a fourteen-year-old girl in an empty cotton house and tarred and feathered him out of the country"" (43, 79).</p>","Yes"
"19095","227","Byron Snopes","Snopes, Byron","Wesley Snopes","<p>Although Flem, Montgomery Ward, I.O. and Clarence are mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, in that first Yoknapatawpha fiction Byron is the first Snopes whom Faulkner develops into a character.  Many Snopeses are named for famous men or products in American culture (vide ""Montgomery Ward"").  'Byron Societies' were bourgeois reading groups in the U.S. about the time Byron Snopes would have been born - there is even a ""Byron Club"" in Jefferson in <em>The Town</em> (325) - but it's hard to imagine Byron's parents (revealed in the Snopes trilogy to be I.O. and his second wife) knew who Lord Byron was.  On the other hand, Faulkner expects his readers to appreciate the irony: Lord Byron wrote Romantic poetry; Byron Snopes writes anonymous mash notes to Narcissa Benbow that are absurd rather than erotic.  Those letters play a major role in ""There Was a Queen,"" where Byron is not named but referred to as  ""that book-keeper in Colonel Sartoris' bank"" and ""the man who robbed the bank"" (739, 740).  That position and the way he abuses it - stealing what 'Sartoris' represents - is Faulkner's symbolic representation of how the Snopeses as a group threaten the social order.  In <em>Flags</em> the idea that a Snopes could aspire to the hand of a Benbow (like the Sartorises another old Yoknapatawpha family) is ominous enough.  In the last two texts that mention him (in <em>The Town</em> and<em>The Mansion</em>) Byron remains offstage, but the biracial (Faulkner would have said miscegenated) children he has with an Apache woman return to Yoknapatawpha as a kind of plague.  In the end, though, these kids are banished, just as in the beginning, in <em>Flags</em>, Bryon winds up running away from Yoknapatawpha.</p>","Yes"
"19094","226","Melisandre Backus Stevens","Stevens, Melisandre Stevens","Mr. Backus, Unnamed Mother of Mrs. Harriss","<p>Although through most of the 1930s and 1940s Gavin Stevens looks like a confirmed bachelor, in four late fictions Faulkner decided to add love and marriage to his biography.  The woman he marries was born Melisandre Backus, the descendant of the Melisandre who married a Backus in the middle of the Civil War (""My Grandmother Millard"") and more immediately the only child of a Yoknapatawpha plantation owner.  By the time she marries Gavin, she is the widow of a New Orleans gangster and the mother of two children. When she first appears in ""Knight's Gambit"" she is ""the softly fading still softly pretty woman in the late thirties"" (148); to Gavin, who turns out to have been the unknown local man to whom she had been mysteriously engaged at sixteen, she has ""been created for simple love and grief"" (156).  Curiously, even after she and Gavin are married, the story never gives her any name but that of her first husband - she is ""Mrs. Harriss.""  Nor is she named when she briefly appears in ""By the People,"" except as the ""new aunt"" of Charles Mallison (88).  In both <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>, however, she is identified as Melisandre Backus, a childhood friend of Gavin's sister Maggie.  For most of her adult life she traveled in Europe, and the lives she led in Yoknapatawpha - as girl, wife, widow and wife again - are barely discussed.</p>","Yes"

The older brother of the murdered infant, the perceptive Bucky asks his mother, ""How long will we stay in California, mamma?"" and ""Will we stay here until they hang Nancy, mamma?"" (61).</p>","Yes"
"19091","223","Temple Drake Stevens","Stevens, Temple Drake","Drake, Mother of Temple, Judge Drake","<p>As Temple Drake, she is the principal character in <em>Sanctuary</em> (1931); as Temple Drake Stevens, she is at the center of the dramatic portions of <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.  She is (as she says frequently in the first novel) the daughter of a judge, a member of an aristocratic family, and a very complex young woman.  In the first novel she is a seventeen-year-old college student, ""a small childish figure no longer quite a child, not yet quite a woman"" (89), the heir to southern traditions trying on the contemporary role of flapper.  In the second, set a decade later, she is a young mother of two who feels most at home in the company of a former prostitute and a small-time crook.  The story Faulkner is interested in using her to tell is sensational and ironic but at the same time informed by his interest in and anxieties about the cultural phenomenon of the new woman who emerges after the First World War.  That story begins when she is taken beyond the bounds of her upper class environment in <em>Sanctuary</em>.  In the first part of the novel she is horrifically raped, but when her attacker carries her to a Memphis brothel she seems to find a new life in its erotically and emotionally bizarre surroundings.  At the end she perjures herself to get an innocent man convicted of rape and murder, and goes back to her father's side.  Readers are likely to be alternately sympathetic and appalled.  In <em>Requiem</em> Faulkner forces ""Temple Drake Stevens,"" a wife and mother, to confront her past as ""Temple Drake"" - the part of her that responds deeply to passions and people who have no place in her conventional life; as part of that process she must confess the role that deeper self played in the murder of her own infant daughter.  In the first novel Horace Benbow fails in his attempt to rescue her, but it seems that in the second Gavin Stevens (with the help of Nancy, the black former prostitute who sacrifices herself for Temple) is able to lead her to redemption.</p>","Yes"
"19090","222","First Yoknapatawpha Stevens","Stevens, First Yoknapatawpha","","<p>There's no question that the Stevenses are one of the oldest families in Yoknapatawpha, but they may or may not be among the very first.  When the most famous Stevens - Gavin - appears in <em>Light in August</em>, the narrator simply says his ""ancestors"" ""owned slaves in Jefferson (444).  In ""Hand upon the Waters,"" however, one of the <em>Knight's Gambit</em> stories in which Gavin becomes a kind of detective, the narrator identifies the earliest ""Stevens"" as one of the first three white men to settle in what became Jefferson.  That's a revision of the account Faulkner provides in other fictions, and the story doesn't say anything more about who this ur-Stevens might be.  Some scholars identify him as the same character as the 'Lemuel' or the 'Judge' or the 'Captain' Stevens who appears elsewhere, but if he arrives at the very dawn of the county's white history he would probably have to be at least one generation older than any of these men.</p>","Yes"
"19089","221","Herbert Head","Head, Herbert","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Herbert Head, whom Mrs. Compson calls ""my Harvard boy"" (93), is a banker from South Bend, Indiana. He and the already-pregnant Caddy meet in the fashionable resort of French Lick; in April 1910 they marry after Herbert promises Jason a job in the family bank, and tries to bribe Quentin to keep secret his expulsion from Harvard for cheating. The marriage does not last a year: when he discovers Caddy's pregnancy, Herbert disowns her and her child.  He becomes Caddy's unnamed 'first' husband in the ""Appendix Compson"" that Faulkner wrote 17 years later, but the ""extremely eligible young Indianian"" described there is the same figure as the novel had described (332).</p>","Yes"
"19088","220","Maggie Dandridge Stevens","Stevens, Maggie Dandridge","","<p>The mother of Gavin and Maggie - Mrs. Lemuel Stevens, nee Maggie Dandridge - doesn't appear in person in the fictions, but various items associated with her do.  In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> the hat Eunice Habersham wears reminds her grandson Chick Mallison of her; it's a ""round faintly dusty-looked black hat set squarely on the top of her head"" (73); on both women, this looks ""exactly right"" (127).  In ""Knight's Gambit"" Chick thinks of the books in his family's house as ""the books . . . which his grandmother had chosen"" (149).  In <em>The Town</em> Chick's mother, Maggie Mallison, wears his grandmother's ""diamond ear-rings"" to the Cotillion Ball (75).  Talking with Chick in this novel Gavin even remembers the car he drove when he went to the Backus place to ask permission to marry Melisandre as ""your grandmother's car"" (246).  She is also mentioned by Lucas Beauchamp in <em>Intruder</em>.</p>","Yes"
"19087","219","Charles Mallison II","Mallison, Charles II","Charles Mallison I, Maggie Stevens Mallison","<p>Charles Mallison Jr. appears in nine texts, in all but one of them mainly as narrator, especially of the exploits and misadventures of the man he refers to hundreds of times, usually in an admiring tone, as ""Uncle Gavin."" Gavin is Gavin Stevens, and his nephew is thus a member of one of the older upper class families in Yoknapatawpha, the only child of Gavin's twin sister Maggie Stevens Mallison.  Faulkner creates Charles (""Chick,"" as Gavin calls him once in ""Tomorrow,"" the first time he's given any name) to serve as a kind of Dr. Watson to Gavin's kind of Sherlock Holmes in the <em>Knight's Gambit</em> detective stories, but in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> he becomes a major character in his own right, as a sixteen-year-old who bravely sets out to save a black man from being lynched.  In the process he becomes a detective figure himself, and also the penultimate young man in the line of Faulkner's knightly idealists, the sons of the aristocratic class who confront the dragons of southern history and society.  Chick even rides a horse as he goes off to this quest.  Although it's interesting that his character becomes most promising when he stops listening to what ""Uncle Gavin said,"" the frequency of Chick's appearances does mainly derive from Faulkner's fondness for Gavin as a character.  He is again given the part of a narrator in the last two volumes of the Snopes trilogy, but from the larger arc of his appearances we can construct a kind of biography for him.  By the end of <em>The Mansion</em> he has followed his Uncle Gavin to Harvard and the University of Mississippi and toward a legal career, and become the first member of his family to serve in the military, either as an aviator in the Pacific (""By the People"") or as part of a bomber crew that is shot down over Europe and taken prisoner during World War II (<em>The Mansion</em>).  On the other hand, it is hard to locate that biography in time.  In ""Knight's Gambit,"" Chick is ""almost eighteen"" just before December 7, 1941, so would have been born in 1923 (205).  That date of birth works well enough for five other stories, but given the probable post-World War II setting of <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, there Chick's date of birth would be about a decade later, and by his own accounting in both <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em> he had to have been born about a decade earlier, around 1914.  (For more on dates, see the Notes of the Texts for these works.)  Chick's birthdate is one of the more extreme examples of the flexible demographics of Faulkner's world.</p>","Yes"
"19086","218","Charles Mallison I","Mallison, Charles I","","<p>Although he is mentioned in three short stories and actually appears in three novels, the father of Charles Mallison, Jr., remains an elusive character.  He is dead in the first story that mentions him (""An Error in Chemistry"") and almost irrelevant even in the texts where he appears: <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>.  His wife, Maggie Stevens by birth and Gavin's twin sister, sometimes calls him Charley, and according to <em>The Town</em> he owns the livery stable in Jefferson (at a time when cars are displacing horses).  His most dramatic moment occurs in <em>The Mansion</em>, when he breaks up the fight between Gavin and Manfred de Spain.  He has the most to say in <em>The Town</em>, especially when he can tease Gavin about his infatuation with Flem Snopes' wife.  He has a very limited role in bringing up the son who is named after him; that is almost entirely done by ""Uncle Gavin.""</p>","Yes"
"19085","217","Maggie Stevens Mallison","Mallison, Maggie Stevens","Lemuel Stevens","<p>Margaret (Maggie) Mallison is Judge Stevens' daughter, Gavin's twin sister, Charles Mallison's wife and Chick's mother.  The role she plays in the six late fictions in which she appears or is mentioned is largely defined by her relationship to these male figures, especially to her son, toward whom she is unfailingly protective despite his own restiveness with her concerns.  She is well-educated, within the limits defined by her gender and her caste: she attended the Jefferson Female Academy, where she met and became friends with the woman whom Gavin would eventually marry.  She is also intelligent and humorous and at base a kind person, as we see when in <em>The Town</em> she enlists in Gavin's cause to get Eula Snopes accepted by the other ladies of the town, and by her treatment of Eula's daughter Linda when she comes over for Sunday dinner.  When the occasion calls for physical as well as moral courage, as in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, she rises to it with grace and authority - which arouses her son's protective instincts though she declines his help.</p>","Yes"
"19084","216","Gavin Stevens","Stevens, Gavin","Lemuel Stevens","<p>Gavin Stevens appears altogether in seventeen fictions, making him one of Faulkner's most frequently recurring characters.  Details about his past vary from text to text between ""Hair"" (1931) and <em>The Mansion</em> (1960) - ""Hand Upon the Waters"" describes him as the last remaining descendant of the original settlers of Yoknapatawpha; ""Knight's Gambit"" and <em>The Mansion</em> are the only texts to describe his service as a non-combatant in World War I.  And in those two later texts he abruptly marries a former sweetheart, though elsewhere he appears to be a confirmed bachelor.  But one part of his biography remains consistent: he is the best educated inhabitant of Yoknapatawpha. ""Phi Beta Kappa, Harvard; Ph.D., Heidelberg,"" as the narrator of <em>Go Down, Moses</em> sums it up (353).  Despite his experience of the larger world, Gavin returns to acquire a law degree at the University of Mississippi before he comes home to serve Yoknapatawpha as County Attorney in many of the texts, as Faulkner's version of Sherlock Holmes in the six detective fictions published together in <em>Knight's Gambit</em>, and in general as ""the designated paladin of justice and truth"" (<em>Moses</em>, 364).   He defends the people of the county (whose vernacular he knows how to speak) from criminals, the town of Jefferson and even Flem's wife and daughter from Snopesism, and in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> the white South from the ""outlanders"" - the people ""North and East and West"" who seek to ""force"" civil rights legislation on the region (199).  Faulkner doesn't hesitate to undercut Gavin's character at times.  The scene between Eula Snopes as seducer and Gavin as affrighted virgin in Chapter 5 of <em>The Town</em> is a particularly comic instance of this.  But Faulkner allows Gavin's voice to fill up a lot of pages in the fiction from the second half of his career, not just as one of the narrators of <em>The Town</em> but as someone who loves to hear himself explaining the world to other people.  Scholars disagree about whether we should read Gavin as a <em>raissoneur</em>, someone who speaks for Faulkner, but for Charles Mallison, biologically his nephew, psychologically his surrogate son, and the other character who has to listen to Gavin more than anyone else, Gavin's voice seems to articulate ""everything which as he himself became more and more a man he had found to be true"" (<em>Intruder</em>, 190).  It is actually Gavin Stevens who, in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, speaks those famous words about the past being ""never dead"" that are invariably attributed to Faulkner (73).</p>","Yes"

"19082","214","Gowan Stevens' Grandfather","Stevens, Grandfather of Gowan","","<p>We know Gowan Stevens had a grandfather, because in <em>The Town</em> Charles Mallison mentions that Gowan's grandfather was his own grandfather's brother, but that doesn't tell us if Faulkner - or Temple Drake - actually has this man in mind when in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> she tries to cover up what she was actually saying by telling Gowan that ""I was telling Uncle Gavin he had something of Virginia or some sort of gentleman in him too that he must have inherited from you through your grandfather"" (51-52).  These are the only two mentions of this grandfather in the fictions.</p>","No"
"19081","213","Gowan Stevens","Stevens, Gowan","Gowan Stevens&#039; Mother, Gowan Stevens&#039; Father","<p>The Stevenses are an old Jefferson family that becomes a very big part of the story of Yoknapatawpha by way of Faulkner's fondness for Gavin.  The first member of the family to appear in the fictions is ""Judge Stevens"" in ""A Rose for Emily,"" but in <em>Sanctuary</em> Gavin's second cousin Gowan becomes the first Stevens to play a significant role.  And in <em>Sanctuary</em> Faulkner's treatment of Gowan is scathing.  He's a recent graduate of the University of Virginia who likes to claim that he learned there both how to hold his liquor and how to be a gentleman.  In fact, his inability either to stay sober or to act decently, much less chivalrously, proves disastrous for Temple Drake.  He slinks away from Yoknapatawpha about a third of the way through the narrative.  However, Faulkner allows him to redeem himself almost two decades later, when he returns imaginatively to Temple and Gowan in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>.  According to that drama, not long after the events of <em>Sanctuary</em> they married, Gowan has stayed sober for eight years, and his face tells a new story: ""something has happened to it - tragedy - something . . . which it has accepted and is trying, really and sincerely and selflessly . . . to do its best with according to its code"" (54).  The plot of <em>Requiem</em> visits another traumatic event on him and Temple; this time he still there at the end, offstage but heard speaking his wife's name as the second to last word of the drama.  In his final appearance in <em>The Town</em>, he is younger than in the earlier texts, a child living with the extended Stevens family while his parents are overseas.  This middle volume in the Snopes trilogy uses Gavin mainly as a narrative source, a witness to Flem's machinations - a role that subordinates him to the voice of his younger cousin Charles, who is telling Flem's story to us.  But the story of Gowan himself that nonetheless emerges is that of a youth becoming an adolescent, and curious about the ways adults behave.</p>","Yes"
"19080","212","Gowan Stevens' Mother","Stevens, Mother of Gowan","","<p>Gowan Stevens' mother never appears in person, but three Yoknapatawpha fictions mention her.  If we re-arrange their order of publication as the sequence of events in her biography, her youngest mention occurs in <em>The Town</em>, where she accompanies her husband for the duration of his State Department assignment to ""some far place"" - which explains why she sends her son Gowan from Washington to Jefferson (3).  The next mention occurs in <em>Sanctuary</em>, when after her disgraced son has fled the county she writes Narcissa Sartoris a letter that Jenny Du Pre makes fun of; that passage strongly implies she now lives in Jefferson.  And in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, set eight years later, Gavin Stevens suggests that the car Gowan and Temple Drake were driving back in <em>Sanctuary</em> might have been Gowan's ""mother's"" (107).  Even arranged this way, the mentions don't tell us much at all about her character; however, her married name, at least, locates her (like Narcissa Benbow Sartoris and Jenny Sartoris Du Pre) among the county's upper class ladies.</p>","Yes"
"19079","211","Lemuel Stevens","Stevens, Lemuel","First Yoknapatawpha Stevens","<p>Lemuel Stevens - usually Judge Stevens, but ""Captain Stevens"" in ""Tomorrow"" (96) - is the father of Gavin, and probably, although scholars disagree about this, the son of another man named Judge Stevens.  He appears or is mentioned in 7 different texts.  We see him in his role as a judge, but the military title is confusing, since there is no evidence that any of the Stevens family serve in either the U.S. or the Confederate armies.  More important than the man is his law office on the Square in Jefferson, where Gavin in turn practices law and which is a frequent setting for events in the later fictions.</p>","Yes"

The fact that he was a sergeant rather than a commissioned officer complicates the question of the family's class status.   When, for example, Lucius earlier discusses how his great-grandmother, this man's wife, taught his grandfather how to behave as a gentleman, it seems to imply an upper class background (cf. 200) - but in Faulkner such a background usually translates into a higher military rank than sergeant.</p>","No"

According to the narrator, it is known that Lucas has ""one daughter with grandchildren"" (214).  Since this is mentioned in context with Lucas' age, it's possible that the ""grandchildren"" are his daughter's, making Lucas himself a great-grandfather, but no other details or family members are mentioned - and it's more likely that the phrase means Lucas himself has a daughter and grandchildren, which is the way we've chosen to interpret it.</p>","Yes"

According to Gombault, ""she would have been right lonesome up here with just McCallums"" (60).</p>","Yes"
"19070","202","Belle Mitchell Benbow","Benbow, Belle Mitchell","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Belle is Harry Mitchell's wife and Horace Benbow's lover for most of the novel, though she is Mrs. Benbow at the end. With Harry she has a daughter, Little Belle. Her hair is described as a ""rich bloody auburn"" (199), and her personality in equally vivid if pejorative terms: ""her eyes are like hothouse grapes and her mouth was redly mobile, rich with discontent"" (182).  ""Smoldering"" is recurrent adjective for her (201, 203, etc.).  Unlike the aristocratic Benbows, she is very much a citizen of the New South.  Narcissa, Horace's sister, calls her ""dirty!"" (206).  Horace thinks of her as the fatal attraction he cannot resist.  Belle is only seen, briefly, at the very end of <em>Sanctuary</em>, but as the woman from whom Horace feels the need to escape after a decade of marriage she is often very present in his thoughts, and in his conversations with the other women in the life he tries to resume in Jefferson after leaving her.  When he returns to her, defeated, she gets the last word in their relationship: ""'Lock the back door,' she said"" (301).</p>","Yes"
"19069","201","Colonel John Sartoris' Father","Sartoris, Father of Colonel John","","<p>In ""There Was a Queen,"" Elnora refers to Miss Jenny's ""paw"" as having been killed by the Yankees during the Civil War (732).  She doesn't say any more about him, and he is not even mentioned in any other texts, but the larger story of the Sartoris family as Faulkner tells it elsewhere, especially in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and <em>The Unvanquished</em>, suggests that this man owned a slave plantation in one of the Carolinas - and that the family's ""Cal-lina house"" was a mansion before the Yankees burned it down (732).</p>","No"

There is no way to know for sure which specific ""womenfolks"" these are; if Faulkner is being consistent with his other Yoknapatawpha fictions, this group cannot include Sartoris' wife, who died a decade before the War, but could include his mother-in-law, Rosa Millard, who lived on his plantation during the War in the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories, and perhaps his two young daughters, who are mentioned but not named in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  It's not safe, however, to assume Faulkner is being consistent from one text to the next.</p>","Yes"

The account of him that his son provides in <em>The Mansion</em>, however, leaves little room for sympathy: he's a ""son of a bitch"" (111) who constantly beat his second-wife, Mink's step-mother - and with whom Mink had to use violence to get even a ""pittance"" of the money he earned working with his family on ""the implacable rented ground by months behind a plow""  (318).</p>","No"

They are two years apart in age, but the first novel does not distinguish between them.  The second does: unlike the older sister, this ""younger daughter"" becomes ""the madam"" of a Memphis whorehouse (320) - though that detail is mentioned only when the narrative notes that Mink unknowingly walks past the place on his way to buy a pistol.</p>","Yes"

This is the older one, though the novel does not distinguish between them when it depicts them, for example, hiding behind their mother's ""skirts as if they were deaf or as if they lived in another world"" (82). They were conceived two years apart, in the first five years of their parents' marriage (264).  In <em>The Mansion</em>, the ""two daughters"" are mentioned, briefly; this older one disappears after her father goes to prison and her mother dies (10).</p>","Yes"
"19062","195","Yettie Snopes","Snopes, Yettie","Unnamed Father-in-Law of Mink Snopes, Unnamed Mother-in-Law of Mink Snopes","<p>Mink Snopes' wife - given a first name, Yettie, in <em>The Mansion</em>, the second and last fiction in which she appears - plays a small part in the large saga of the Yoknapatawpha Snopeses, but has a very powerful backstory, as it's described in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  Mink met during his travels, when after seeing her ""standing in the savage lamp-light . . . in the open door of the mess-hall in that south Mississippi convict camp"" (243-44), he called a halt to his travels and took a job at the camp.  Her mother died in giving birth to her.  She grew up at the camp in ""a tract of wildcatted virgin timber"" with her father, owner of the camp, and his ""quadroon"" mistress (262).  In her youth, she had ""a splendid heavy mane"" of ""black hair"" before cutting it ""man-short with razors"" in order to avoid getting lice from the convict-laborers with whom she had sex promiscuously; according to Mink, she was ""not a nympholept but the confident lord of a harem"" (262), her room being the ""fierce simple cave of a lioness"" (263).  With the collapse of her father's business five months after Mink arrives, the two marry and return to Mink's native country to share crop and produce two children within the first five years of marriage.  She shows no affection for Mink, but after he goes into hiding as a murderer, she tries to serve him - though perhaps by raising money through a return to prostitution.  Mink is never sure the children they have are his.  To this biography <em>The Mansion</em> adds the facts that Yettie ""cant read and write neither"" (55), and that she dies while Mink is serving his sentence at Parchman.</p>","Yes"
"19061","194","Linda Snopes Kohl","Kohl, Linda Snopes","Eula Varner Snopes, Hoake|Hoke McCarron","<p>Linda's character comes into focus slowly but steadily across three decades and six fictions.  In the first of those, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, as Flem Snopes' ""baby"" she is not named nor even gendered.  In the next, she still has no name or gender but Suratt, the narrator of ""Spotted Horses,"" sees her clearly enough to call her ""as well-growed a three-months-old baby as we ever see"" (167) - implicitly suggesting she was conceived out of wedlock, and that Flem might not be her father.  She is mentioned (as ""well-grown"") but not seen in ""Centaur in Brass,"" but there the reference to her mother's ""sudden marriage"" repeats the idea of her illegitimacy.  That idea is confirmed in <em>The Hamlet</em>, along with the fact that her biological father is not Flem but a man named Hoake McCarron, to whom her mother Eula lost her virginity but who left Yoknapatawpha when the pregnancy was discovered; Linda herself, however, is not given a name until the next novel in the Snopes trilogy, <em>The Town</em>.  There her character remains subordinate to her mother's tragedy, but her possible future is an important part of the story.  She is courted by the young men of Jefferson, and informally but persistently tutored by Gavin Stevens, who is determined to save her from her false position as Flem Snopes' daughter.  Before her death Eula makes Gavin Stevens promise to marry Linda, but in the event Gavin chooses instead to send her to Greenwich Village, which he calls ""a place with a few unimportant boundaries but no limitations where young people of any age go to seek dreams"" (367).  The trilogy's last volume, <em>The Mansion</em>, keeps her offstage until Gavin travels north to witness her wedding to a sculptor named Barton Kohl, but it ultimately becomes clear that Linda will escape the destiny that her past seemed to predict.  When she returns to Yoknapatawpha in the second half of the novel, a deaf but undaunted widow who has served with her husband on the right (though losing) side of the Spanish Civil War, she takes up the cause of civil rights in Yoknapatawpha.  She is defeated there too, but she remains in control of her own destiny, driving off to the future she will choose for herself in a brand new Jaguar - after subtlely but clearly getting vengeance for her mother by acting as an accomplice in Flem's murder.  She is tough, generous, sexually secure, one of the most independent, experienced characters - male or female - in the canon.</p>","Yes"
"19060","193","Hoake|Hoke McCarron","McCarron, Hoake|Hoke","McCarron, Father of Hoke, Alison Hoake McCarron","<p>Whether as Hoake (as his name is spelled in <em>The Hamlet</em>) or Hoke (as it's spelled in <em>The Town</em> and <em>The Mansion</em>), McCarron plays a biologically crucial role in the Snopes trilogy as the father of Linda Snopes, daughter of Eula and, ostensibly, Flem.  His character is not attractive - except to Eula - in the first novel.  He is an outsider to Yoknapatawpha, the son of substantial property owners, ""a little swaggering and definitely spoiled though not vain so much as intolerant"" (150). He is also aggressive and cruel, having grown up with a ""negro lad for his sole companion,"" whom he pays ""for the privilege of whipping the negro, not severely, with a miniature riding crop"" (150-51).  After beating out the local rivals for Eula - the 'beating' becomes literal in a climactic fight with a handful of them - he abandons her when he learns that she is pregnant.  He is only mentioned in <em>The Town</em>, but is briefly united with his daughter in <em>The Mansion</em>, when as a successful businessman he travels to New York City to be at Linda's marriage.  There is more to like about his character in that second and last appearance.</p>","Yes"
"19059","190","Eula Varner Snopes","Snopes, Eula Varner","Maggie Varner, Will Varner","<p>Eula is mentioned in Faulkner's first Yoknapatawpha novel (1929) and two short stories from the 1930s.  She's simply Flem's ""wife"" in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (166).  The stories, however, introduce the character trait that will dominate her portrayal in the Snopes trilogy: her sexual attractiveness.  As the youngest daughter of Will and Maggie Varner in ""Spotted Horses"" she's a ""big, soft-looking"" girl whom suitors swarm around ""like bees around a honey pot"" (166).  As Flem Snopes' wife in ""Centaur in Brass"" she has ""something of that vast, serene, impervious beauty of a snowclad virgin mountain flank"" (150-51).  She plays a major role in <em>The Hamlet</em>, where one of the novel's four sections is titled ""Eula"" and her sexuality acquires a mythic status: ""her entire appearance suggested some symbology out of the old Dionysic times"" (105).  In the next volume of the Snopes trilogy, <em>The Town</em>, her story displaces even that of her husband Flem at the center of the narrative's power.  The story is a tragic one, of how poor the men in her world are compared to the richness of her character.  Impregnated by a man who runs away, married off for propriety's sake by her father to Flem, who is both sexually impotent and willing to use her to further his own venal ambitions, the mistress of another man who cannot save her when she realizes she must sacrifice herself for the sake of her daughter, much too large for the pettiness she brings out in the 'good' people of Yoknapatawpha, it is a tragedy of waste.  What may come as a surprise to readers who judged her at first as the fictions seem to as well, by her body, is the way Faulkner ultimately allows her to display the greatness of her spirit - when it's too late for anything to save her.  Her hypocritical husband puts up a monument to her virtues as a ""Wife"" in the town cemetery, which Gavin Stevens - who spends much of <em>The Town</em> trying ineffectually to save her - seeks to redeem by adding to it a costly imported ""marble medallion"" of her face (372).  But imaginatively her memorial lies in the complex ways that in the trilogy's final volume, <em>The Mansion</em>, her absence shapes the lives of the people she left behind.</p>","Yes"
"19058","192","Maggie Varner","Varner, Maggie","","<p>Mrs. Will Varner, Maggie Varner in <em>The Hamlet</em>, figures in four of the fictions (compared to her husband's ten).  She is mentioned in <em>As I Lay Dying</em> as the unnamed wife of ""Uncle Billy,"" as Will is called there, specifically in connection with the birth of her first child, Jody.  The next time she is appears, in <em>The Hamlet</em>, she is the mother of sixteen children, eleven of whom still live, though only two of them are important in the novel: Jody and his sister Eula.  The narrator of that novel calls her a ""plump cheery bustling woman who had borne sixteen children and already outlived five of them and who still won prizes for preserving fruits and vegetables at the annual county fair"" (11-12); she raises a commotion when it's discovered that Eula is pregnant.  In <em>The Town</em> Gavin Stevens, one of the novel's narrators, describes ""Mrs. Varner"" as a ""big hard cold gray woman who never came to town anymore now, spending all her time between her home and her church"" (306).  As Varner's wife she has complete control over the ""terrified congregation"" in the church: she hires the ministers herself, ""firing them too when they didn't suit her"" (306). Gavin portrays her as outraged to learn about Eula's 18-year-long affair with Manfred de Spain, though Eula tells Gavin later that she thinks her ""Mamma . . . has known all the time"" (345).  In the last volume of the Snopes trilogy, <em>The Mansion</em>, Mrs. Varner and her sense of propriety are manipulated by her son-in-law, Flem Snopes, as a crucial part of his scheme to become president of the bank in Jefferson.</p>","Yes"
"19057","191","Will Varner","Varner, Will","","<p>Will Varner appears or is mentioned in ten different texts, as ""Uncle Billy"" in the first two and as ""Will"" in all but one of the others (in ""Centaur in Brass"" he is the unnamed father of Flem Snopes' wife).  In those first two - <em>As I Lay Dying</em> and ""Spotted Horses"" - he is a farmer and veterinarian who (in the absence of a real doctor) sets the broken legs of two different human critters.  But in the other texts he makes a much more commanding figure as ""the principal landowner"" in Frenchman's Bend, to quote from his third text, ""Lizards in Jamshyd's Courtyard"" (136).  <em>The Hamlet</em> provides the most impressive resume of his titles and traits: there he is a farmer, a landlord, a usurer, and a veterinarian, and serves as the ""beat supervisor in one county and Justice of the Peace in the next and election commissioner in both"" (5). He also owns at least most of the local businesses: the store, the cotton gin and the combined gristmill and blacksmith shop. He presides over his fiefdom from ""a home-made chair on the jungle-choked lawn of the Old Frenchman’s home-site"" (6). With his wife Maggie, he has produced sixteen children though only two of them, Jody and Eula, remain in Frenchman’s Bend; he also has the energy into his sixties to continue having affairs with the wives of various farmers who are his tenants.  Even after Flem moves to Jefferson in the last two volumes of the Snopes trilogy, Will continues to play a significant role in his story, as Flem's father-in-law and, perhaps surprisingly, one of the principal investors in the Sartoris bank in town.  Faulkner describes his physical appearance as resembling ""a Methodist Sunday School Superintendent"" (6). He is ""thin as a fence rail"" and ""long,"" possessing ""reddish-gray hair and moustaches and little hard bright innocently blue eyes"" (6).  He is just about as acquisitive and ruthless as Flem, but his lusts are portrayed as attractively human.</p>","Yes"
"19056","189","Isaac Snopes","Snopes, Isaac","","<p>Appearing only in <em>The Hamlet</em>, Isaac ""Ike"" Snopes is the cognitively limited cousin of Flem and Mink. At 14, he is a ""hulking figure"" in ""bursting overalls"" (94) who works around Mrs. Littlejohn's hotel as a kind of janitor.  Ike is referred to as an ""idiot"" and ""creature"" with a ""mowing and bobbing head"" and a ""Gorgon-face"" that ""had been blasted empty and clean forever of any thought, the slobbering mouth in its mist of soft gold hair"" (95).  Officially, Flem is Ike's guardian, but he does nothing to protect Ike from being exploited by Lump Snopes.  Faulkner's account of Ike's romantic and sexual relationship with Jack Houston’s cow is both grotesque and affecting; his vision of her beauty parodies sentimental literature and yet possesses mythic proportions and genuine human poignancy.</p>","Yes"
"19055","188","Mink Snopes","Snopes, Mink","","<p>One of Flem's closest relations - on the tangled Snopes family tree they share a common grandmother - Mink is described in <em>The Mansion</em> as a ""small frail creature, not much larger than a fifteen-year-old boy"" (55).  Inside that body, however, he carries around enough rage to claim two men's lives.  He first appears in <em>The Hamlet</em> when Faulkner decides to adapt his earlier short story ""The Hound"" into the saga of the Snopeses.  In the story, the rage belongs to a sharecropper named Cotton; in both texts, the murdered man is named Houston, a local landowner who becomes the target of Cotton's and then Mink's bitterness and frustration after a lifetime of 'poor white' poverty and indignity.  ""The Hound"" ends with Cotton in jail.  Mink's story has only begun at that point.  Arrested for the killing, Mink puts his faith in Flem, in the belief that Flem will somehow save him.  What happens when that faith fails is a major element of the last volume of the Snopes trilogy.  Mink is mentioned in <em>The Town</em>, the intermediate volume, but Mink's monomaniac focus on getting revenge against Flem organizes <em>The Mansion</em> from its first page through its last, and achieves a kind of anti-heroic grandeur.  He is mentioned one last time in <em>The Reivers</em>, as Flem's ""mad kinsman"" (25), but that clinical label isn't adequate to characterize the Mink's significance.  His fierce quest is both terrifying and absurd, and yet also deeply human.</p>","Yes"
"19054","187","Colonel Sartoris Snopes","Snopes, Colonel Sartoris","Lennie Snopes, Ab Snopes","<p>Ten-year-old Colonel Sartoris ""Sarty"" Snopes is the focal character in ""Barn Burning."" The youngest of sharecropper Abner Snopes' four children, he is ""small for his age, small and wiry like his father, in patched and faded jeans even too small for him, with straight, uncombed, brown hair and eyes gray and wild as storm scud"" (4).  The story begins by describing his hunger for the food on sale in the country store where his father is being tried as a barn burner, but revolves around his deeper, more despairing hunger for something less tangible - for ""peace and dignity"" (10) in a world that is ""ordered"" differently from the one he was born into (9).  Sarty is named for Colonel John Sartoris, a towering figure in Yoknapatawpha County lore; unlike his namesake, however, Sarty himself never appears in any other Faulkner text.  He is vaguely evoked in <em>The Hamlet</em> when Ratliff, recalling an event in ""Barn Burning"" - the Snopeses arriving at the De Spain plantation - vaguely recalls the presence of another son besides Flem, a ""little one"" he remembers ""seeing him once somewhere"" (15).</p>","Yes"
"19053","186","Snopes, Twin Sister of Net","Snopes, Twin Sister of Net","Ab Snopes, Lennie Snopes","<p>While Abner and Lennie Snopes' older son Flem is one of the most prominent inhabitants of Faulkner's imagination, and their younger son Sarty the central character of one of his greatest short stories, neither of their twin daughters gets much attention in the two texts in which they figure. This is the sister who never gets a first name - or to use a Faulknerian locution, this is 'notNet Snopes.'   In ""Barn Burning"" both are described as ""big, bovine, in a flutter of cheap ribbons"" (9), and extremely lazy: they do very little to help with household chores, leaving most of the work to their mother and aunt. Not even a name enables us to tell them apart in <em>The Hamlet</em>, where they are simply described as “two hulking gals” who still take no part in the intensive labor their mother and aunt engage in (15). We speculate that the sisters are ""the Snopes girls"" referred to in <em>The Town</em> (383): the ""Mrs. Dink Quistenberry"" who is  ""one of Mr Snopes's sisters or nieces or something"" (378).  ""Sister or niece"" is hardly definitive, nor is the reference to Dink himself as Flem's ""brother-in-law or whatever it was"" (378).  But if this identification is correct, then this twin (or perhaps her sister) helps her husband run the Snopes Hotel in Jefferson.</p>","Yes"
"19052","185","Net Snopes","Snopes, Net","Ab Snopes, Lennie Snopes","<p>While Abner and Lennie Snopes' older son Flem is one of the most prominent inhabitants of Faulkner's imagination, and their younger son Sarty the central character of one of his greatest short stories, neither of their twin daughters gets much attention in the two texts in which they figure.  Only one sister - Net, this one - is named.  In ""Barn Burning"" both are described as ""big, bovine, in a flutter of cheap ribbons"" (9), and very lazy: they do very little to help with household chores, leaving most of the work to their mother and aunt.  Not even a name enables us to tell them apart in  <em>The Hamlet</em>, where they are simply described as “two hulking gals” who still take no part in the intensive labor their mother and aunt engage in  (15).  We speculate that the sisters are ""the Snopes girls"" referred to in <em>The Town</em> (383); if that's correct, as grown and married woman they each have a husband's last name.  Net, we assume, is now Mrs. Binford.  She lives with her husband ""near Varner's store"" in Frenchman's Bend (383).  But it has to be emphasized that the connection between Net Snopes and Mrs. Binford is speculative.</p>","Yes"
"19051","184","Flem Snopes","Snopes, Flem","Ab Snopes, Lennie Snopes","<p>In the beginning was Flem Snopes.  He is the very first character who appears in the very first fiction about Yoknapatawpha that Faulkner sat down to write.  He is the ""Father Abraham"" in the title of that unfinished text, which was going to tell the story of Flem's rise from tenant farmer's son in Frenchman's Bend to bank president in Jefferson, from a sharecropper's cabin to <em>The Mansion</em> - as the final volume of the Snopes trilogy that Faulkner finished over three decades later is titled.  From the start Faulkner imagined Flem's story as part of a larger sociological problem called 'Snopesism,' the displacement of the social order of the Old South by the forces of modernity: in the Yoknapatawpha fiction that Faulkner wrote when he put the ""Father Abraham"" manuscript aside, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Flem isn't seen, but the way, ""like Abraham of old,"" he brings his 'tribe' - the other members of his poor white family - into Jefferson is referred to as a kind of rapidly spreading infectious disease (166).  Altogether Flem figures in eleven stories and novels.  The trilogy details the series of steps by which Flem climbs the ladder, though as a symptom of a social disorder he perhaps is most threatening when he himself remains outside the narrative as a kind of pervasive but underlying presence.  He is calculating and completely unscrupulous in the way he exploits people, even his family members.  As a step on his way up, he marries the mythically beautiful Eula Varner, but according to <em>The Mansion</em>, ""the only thing he loved was money"" (159). He even, as his cousin Montgomery Ward Snopes puts it, ""parlayed his wife into the presidency of a bank"" (92).  But as he nears his goal - the life he associates with the planter aristocrats he's replacing - he discovers that respectability may matter more than money.  In the end he is revealed to be sexually impotent, and is emotionally very much alone when he is killed.  In her last conversation, Eula provides a strange epitaph for him when she tells Gavin Stevens in <em>The Town</em>, ""You've got to be careful or you'll have to pity him.  You'll have to"" (347).</p>","Yes"
"19049","183","Lennie Snopes","Snopes, Lennie","","<p>Lennie is Abner Snopes' second wife - at least, he is given a childless first wife named Vynie in <em>The Hamlet</em> - and the mother of Flem.  But her most memorable appearance is as the mother of Flem's younger brother in ""Barn Burning.""  There, amidst all the hardships of a tenant farmer's life, she tries very hard to balance her loyalty to her husband with her love for Sarty.  In one of the few times she speaks it is easy to hear her desperation:  ""Abner. Abner. Please don't. Please, Abner"" (14).  She is talking about the way he ruins a landowner's rug, but that is also probably her perpetual refrain.  In <em>The Hamlet</em> she is not named.  There she is introduced as a ""strapping gal"" (15), at once hardworking and valuable to Ab, who uses her for menial labor and other tasks (15-6).  She also has twin daughters, and a sister named Lizzie who shares her trials.</p>","Yes"
"19048","182","Vynie Snopes","Snopes, Vynie","","<p>In ""Vendee"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em> the woman who opens the door of Ab Snopes' cabin to Bayard and Ringo is presumably his wife - at least, our database makes that presumption.  She tries to throw them off the track by telling them that ""Mr. Snopes"" has gone to Alabama (101, 162).  In <em>The Hamlet</em> Ab has two wives.  This  first one is named Vynie.  As a character she is the same person as the 'Vynie' in the earlier short story ""Fool about a Horse,"" who is the wife of a poor white farmer called ""Pap.""  Vynie's story in <em>The Hamlet</em> is expanded to include the information that she originally came from Jefferson, and that after suffering Ab's foolishness as long as she can, she returns to her father, who threatens to kill Ab if he ever comes back for her. There were no children in this marriage.</p>","Yes"
"19047","181","Ab Snopes","Snopes, Ab","Flem Snopes&#039; Grandmother, Flem Snopes&#039; Grandfather","<p>In the larger Yoknapatawpha saga, Ab Snopes is the patriarch of the Snopes family, the father of Flem, and the memorable 'barn burner' in one of Faulkner's best known stories.  He first emerges in two of the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories, ""The Unvanquished"" and ""Vendee,"" and in the same fictional context reappears in ""My Grandmother Millard"" - all of these are set during the Civil War, but Ab is serving himself rather than the Confederacy as a kind of hanger-on at the Sartoris plantation.  Colonel John Sartoris asks him to look after Rosa Millard while he's away, but indicates how well he knows Ab by also asking Bayard and Ringo to keep an eye on <em>him</em>. In ""Vendee"" he joins up with Grumby's vicious gang and becomes an accomplice to Rosa's murder at their hands.  There is little connection between the story those stories tell about him and the role he plays in the fictions that come later.  In the short story ""Barn Burning,"" a kind of prequel to the Snopes trilogy, he is a violent man embittered by the (decidedly unheroic) wound he got during the Civil War, when he was shot by ""a Confederate provost's man"" while trying to steal a horse (5), and by his impoverished and transient life as a tenant farmer living in cabins that, as he puts it, ""aint fitten for hawgs"" (9).  In the first volume of the trilogy, <em>The Hamlet</em>, he walks on a ""club foot"" which, according to Buck McCaslin's revision of Ab's wounding, is the result of being shot during the Civil War by Colonel Sartoris while trying to steal Sartoris' own horse (18).  That is only one version of Ab's Civil War experience: ""Barn Burning"" says he was shot by a ""Confederate provost's man"" (5), and <em>The Town</em> says he might have been hanged by Confederates during the war as a horse thief (5).  ""Barn Burning"" focuses on his violent relationship with both his younger son, whom he named ""Colonel Sartoris Snopes,"" and with the wealthy landlords whose land he's supposed to work.  At the start of the trilogy he contracts to work a farm for Will Varner in Frenchman's Bend, but from the first Faulkner's focus is on what that means for his older son, Flem.  Ab's most substantial appearance in the trilogy is in the comic story Ratliff tells in <em>The Hamlet</em> about Ab's attempt to best Pat Stamper in a horse trade, a revision of the story ""Fool about a Horse."" Ab married twice, first to Vynie from Jefferson and then to Lennie, with whom he has four children: his sons and twin daughters (one named Net in ""Barn Burning"").  A reference to him in <em>The Mansion</em> suggests he is still alive and living ""two miles"" from Jefferson at least as late as the late 1920s (169).</p>","Yes"
"19046","180","Flem Snopes' Grandfather","Snopes, Grandfather of Flem","","<p>In <em>The Town</em> Flem tells a furniture store owner in Memphis that he had a grandfather, ""because everybody had,"" adding that he never knew his, but ""whoever he was he never owned enough furniture for a room"" (233).  In <em>The Mansion</em> Mink tells the warden of the penitentiary that his and Flem's ""grandpaw had two sets of chillen"" (114).  Those are the only references in the canon to this ur-Snopes, but from them we can infer that he was poor and married twice.  From the Yoknapatawpha fictions as a group we know that he and his wives had a lot of children.</p>","No"
"19045","179","Flem Snopes' Grandmother","Snopes, Grandmother of Flem","","<p>In <em>The Hamlet</em> Mink Snopes tells Ratliff that ""our grandma left us all three ten dollars a piece"" (84).  The three Snopeses here are Mink himself, Flem and Isaac.  This earlier generation of the Snopes family is never clearly brought into focus, but since we know that Flem has more than two 'cousins,' the implication of this bequest is that his grandfather - Ab's father, who is not mentioned in this novel - married twice, and that this grandmother is one of his two wives.  (This inference is supported by what Mink says about his Snopes grandfather in the later novel <em>The Mansion</em>.)</p>","No"
"19044","178","Bobo Beauchamp","Beauchamp, Bobo","Tennie&#039;s Jim|James Beauchamp","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em>, Bobo Beauchamp is ""another motherless Beauchamp child whom Aunt Tennie raised"" on the McCaslin place (223).  The narrative says he is the grandson of Tennie's Jim (21) and the cousin of Lucas Beauchamp (chronologically, however, Tennie's Jim, having been born only about two decades before Bobo, should be his father).  When ""the call of the out-world became too much for him,"" Bobo moved from Yoknapatawpha to Memphis (223), where he worked as a groom for Mr. Van Tosch, the white man who owns the horse Coppermine (i.e. Lightning).  But being ""a young country-bred Negro,"" it was also in Memphis that Bobo got ""mixed up"" with an unscrupulous white man (280), and this was the one thing which led to the other which drives the novel's plot: the loss and very roundabout recovery of Grandfather's automobile.  Lucius refers to him as ""one of us"" (224) - though it's not clear if he means as a member of the extended McCaslin family or as a partisan of the reivers in the horse race.</p>","Yes"
"19043","177","Ned McCaslin","Ned McCaslin","Unnamed Mother of Ned McCaslin","<p>Introduced into <em>The Reivers</em> as ""Grandfather's coachman"" (31), Ned McCaslin plays a major role in the narrative, and becomes, at times at least, one of Faulkner's most complex African American characters.  The novel's narrator, Lucius Priest, calls him ""our family skeleton"" (31).  He was ""born in the McCaslin back yard in 1860,"" at which time he would have been enslaved (31).  His grandfather is Lucius McCaslin, the white man who owned his mother - and after whom Lucius himself is named.  In 1905 he is married to the Priest family's cook (one of his four wives).  Lucius' mother wants her children to call him ""Uncle"" Ned.  She is a McCaslin-Edmonds, and may intend to acknowledge the family relationship, but it is also possible that she is using ""Uncle"" in its familiar cultural sense: to patronize a black male.  Lucius notes, for example, that Ned is ""not Uncle Remus"" around himself, ""members of his own race,"" or when treated as a fellow human being by a white man like Sam Caldwell (178).  The uncertain meaning of 'uncle' in his case reflects the ambiguous way he is depicted in the narrative: at times as a figure of comedy, with a clownish laugh and an affinity for larceny that leads the ""reivers"" into much of the trouble that befalls them; at others as an intelligent man whose race exposes him to shameful abuses, and whose scheming seems entirely justified by his social disenfranchisement.  He dies at age 74.</p>","Yes"
"19042","176","Unnamed Mother of Ned McCaslin","Unnamed Mother of Ned McCaslin","Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin, Unnamed Enslaved Grandmother of Ned McCaslin","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em>, the unnamed mother of Ned McCaslin is ""the natural [i.e. illegitimate] daughter"" of Lucius McCaslin and one of his female slaves (31).  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> the slave with whom McCaslin has a daughter is named Eunice, and their daughter is Tomasina; from her descends the Beauchamp side of the McCaslin family.  These Beauchamps are a major part of the earlier novel's story, and some of them re-appear in <em>The Reivers</em>.  But this novel's brief mention of Ned's lineage does not explain the relationship between the black Beauchamps and the black McCaslins.</p>","Yes"
"19040","174","Lucius Priest III","Priest, Lucius III","Lucius Priest II&#039;s Son","<p>Lucius Priest III is the grandson of Lucius Priest II, who is the grandson of the first Lucius Priest in Yoknapatawpha.  Technically, it is Lucius III who narrates <em>The Reivers</em>, though he speaks only two words in his own first-person voice: the first two words of the text, ""Grandfather said"" (3).  The rest of the novel is apparently being spoken to him by this grandfather, Lucius II, who addresses him as ""you"" in the story's intermittent asides.  We know his name is ""Lucius"" because Lucius II mentions that ""you, me and my grandfather"" were all named after the same person (32), we can tell he is being told the story in 1961, and we can infer that he lives in Yoknapatawpha (though not in either his great-great-grandfather's or his grandfather's homes), and that he already knows something about the major actors and local settings of the story he is listening to.  Otherwise, however, he is not described.  As the invisible source of the narrative, he occupies a complex place in the novel - simultaneously at its center and absent from it.</p>","Yes"
"19039","173","Lucius Priest II's Son","Priest, Son of Lucius II","Lucius Priest II","<p>The narrator of <em>The Reivers</em>, Lucius Priest, at one point mentions ""your father"" to his grandson, the person to whom he is telling the story (25).  From that one reference we can't say definitively if this ""father"" is the narrator's son - or son-in-law.   But if we assume that his grandson bears both Lucius' names (i.e. is a Priest), then it follows that he is a son.  The reference to this ""father"" occurs in connection with the period of ""the mid-thirties"" in Jefferson (25).</p>","Yes"
"19038","172","Roth Edmonds' Child","Unnamed Child of James Beauchamp's Granddaughter and Roth Edmonds","Unnamed Granddaughter of James Beauchamp, Carothers Roth Edmonds","<p>The end of the McCaslin-Edmonds-Beauchamp family line in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> appears essentially as a ""blanket-swaddled bundle"" (340) being carried by his mother; he is the illegitimate child of Roth Edmonds and Edmonds's mistress, the granddaughter of James Beauchamp.  Roth and the young mother are distantly related, making their child the multi-racial product of incest; this an echo of Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin's impregnation of Tomey, the slave girl who was also his daughter.  Roth's rejection of his son means that the child will be raised by his mother, who is planning to return to the North where she grew up.  (An earlier version of this character appears in the short story version of ""Delta Autumn""; see the entry for Unnamed Infant 3 in this index.  The short story and the chapter in the novel are both titled ""Delta Autumn,"" and are almost identical, but by making this infant the youngest descendant of Carothers McCaslin, Faulkner entirely transforms his significance in the larger story of Yoknapatawpha.)</p>","No"

"19034","168","Lucius Priest II","Priest, Lucius II","Alison Lessep Priest, Maury Priest I","<p>Lucius Priest, protagonist and narrator of <em>The Reivers</em>, is both the 11-year-old boy who comes of age among the adventures and misadventures of a trip to Memphis and beyond in 1905, and the 67-year-old grandfather who is recounting that trip for his grandson in 1961.  His lineage is white and aristocratic, but his two companions on the journey are poor white and black.  While other characters remember his class status, he himself is distinguished by his ability to appreciate the various people he encounters - prostitutes, gamblers, Negroes - for their human strengths and weaknesses.  As a protagonist, he is the last of Faulkner's brave, chivalric, young southern gentlemen brought face to face with the traditional patterns of their society (see Quentin Compson, Ike McCaslin and Chick Mallison).  But although he is angered or ashamed at times by the forms of discrimination he sees in his culture, it seems that he ultimately finds his place within its conventional class and race relationships.</p>","Yes"
"19033","165","Carothers Roth Edmonds","Edmonds, Carothers Roth","Zachary Edmonds, Louisa Edmonds","<p>The great-great-great-grandson of Carothers McCaslin, the first Yoknapatawpha McCaslin after whom he is named, Carothers (Roth) Edmonds is the last owner of the McCaslin-Edmonds plantation in the fictions, the white landlord of the Negro tenant farmers who work the fields that he owns.  Among those tenants is his 'black' relative, Lucas Beauchamp, the grandson of Old Carothers.  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> and the stories the precede it - ""A Point of Law"" and ""Gold Is Not Always"" - the relationship between Roth and Lucas is mainly an occasion for comedy.  Roth is choleric and rash, and as a result often exasperated by the shrewder Lucas' ability to manipulate him.  In the ""Delta Autumn"" chapter of the novel, however, in his relationship with a more distant relative - the unnamed Negro woman who is the granddaughter of Lucas' brother James - the flaws in Roth's character become more serious.  Although he doesn't know the young woman is his kin, he does know about the child he and she have had together, but rejects her and their son.  Both the sexual relationship and the cruelty with which Roth denies any human connection to it link him to the sins that his namesake Old Carothers committed a century earlier.  Roth appears in a minor role in ""Race at Morning,"" is only mentioned in ""Pantaloon in Black,"" and is defined by his absence in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>.  He is having surgery in a New Orleans hospital during the events of that novel, which could have meant trouble for Lucas - if two other white characters (not related to McCaslins, Edmondses or Beauchamps) hadn't stepped in to help him.  Roth is apparently still unmarried when Faulkner's last novel, <em>The Reivers</em>, refers to him in 1961 - which leaves the future of the estate up in the air.</p>","Yes"
"19032","167","Alison Lessep Priest","Priest, Alison Lessep","","<p>The most vivid detail that Lucius Priest, the narrator of <em>The Reivers</em>, provides about his mother, Alison, is her love for riding in her father-in-law's automobile: she sits in the back seat with her children, her ""face flushed and bright and eager, like a girl's"" (41).  She is resourceful enough to ""invent a kind of shield"" to keep them all safe whenever Grandfather discharges the tobacco he chews (41).</p>","Yes"
"19031","166","Louisa Edmonds","Edmonds, Louisa","","<p>In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> Zack Edmonds' unnamed wife dies giving birth to their son Roth; that would be around 1898.  In <em>The Reivers</em> ""Cousin Louisa"" is the woman at the McCaslin-Edmonds place who takes care of Lucius' siblings when his parents go to Bay St. Louis (48).  Although that happens in 1905, Louisa is probably Zack's wife, though Faulkner may have instead decided to give Zack a sister named Louisa.  Since there's no sign of that sister elsewhere in the fictions, we assume that Faulkner lost track of the Edmonds family chronology and that Zack's wife and cousin Louisa are the same character.  <em>The Reivers</em> also mentions ""women and children"" in its account of the people who live with Zack and his father, but only Louisa is particularized (25).</p>","Yes"
"19030","164","Samuel Worsham Beauchamp","Beauchamp, Samuel Worsham","","<p>In ""Go Down, Moses,"" and again in the chapter with that title in the novel <em>Go Down, Moses</em> - the only texts he appears in - Samuel is the grandson of Lucas and Molly Beauchamp. As he tells the census taker, to whom he identifies himself by his real name, Samuel Worsham Beauchamp was ""born in the country near Jefferson, Mississippi"" (256, 351). Like well over a million rural black southerners by the 1930s, he has relocated to the urban north. According to him, his ""occupation"" in Chicago before he shot and killed a policeman was ""getting rich too fast"" (256, 352); according to Gavin Stevens, he was a criminal involved in the numbers racket. Gavin calls him ""Butch Beauchamp"" (258, 354). According to the narrator, in the brief firsthand account he provides of the character, Beauchamp is a flamboyant dresser (his ""Hollywood clothes"" are probably a zoot suit), with ""treated"" hair, eyes that ""had seen too much"" and a voice that was ""deliberately and consistently not Southern"" (257, 351).  The texts present him as hardened and indifferent to his imminent execution.  Stevens blames ""some seed"" he inherited from ""the father who begot him,"" ""not only violent but bad"" (258, 354).  His grandmother explains his life with a scriptural parallel, blaming his misfortune on Roth Edmonds, the white landowner who, she says, ""sold him in Egypt"" when he chased him off the plantation (258, 353).</p>","Yes"

She is 'white' enough to pass as 'white' - until the fact that her aunt ""took in washing"" makes Ike realize that she is a Negro (though Ike uses a more offensive term, 343).  She was born and educated in the North, and has taught school in Mississippi.  Roth refuses to marry her, and even her ""Uncle Isaac"" tells her to take her child and ""Go back North.  Marry: a man in your own race"" (345).  With considerable dignity, she rejects both Roth's money and Ike's advice.</p>","No"
"19028","162","Maury Priest I","Priest, Maury I","Sarah Edmonds Priest, Lucius Quintus Priest I","<p>Like William Faulkner's father Murry in real life, Lucius' father Maury Priest owns a livery stable. In the first chapter of <em>The Reivers</em>, Maury displays considerable force of character when he handles the trouble caused by Boon's rash anger.  And the ""gentlemanly"" way he treats even his black employees is worth noting (8).  But after that he becomes almost invisible, even before departing with the rest of the adults in the family for Bay St. Louis.  In what the narrative says about his affinity for local idlers (38), there is an implied comparison between his lack of ambition and his own father's commanding presence.</p>","Yes"
"19027","161","Zachary Edmonds","Edmonds, Zachary","Alice Edmonds, Carothers McCaslin Edmonds","<p>Zachary Edmonds is the son of Cass and Alice, the father of Roth, and the great-great-grandson (on the ""distaff"" side) of the patriarch Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin, from whom the Edmondses inherit the big plantation which Zack runs during the late 19th and early 20th century.  In the <em>Go Down, Moses</em> stories he is characterized mainly through his relationship to the Negro tenant farmer Lucas Beauchamp - who is also his cousin.  Like Bayard Sartoris and Ringo, the white and black boys grow up together, living ""almost as brothers lived"" (54).  As adults, however, Zack lives in the big house and Lucas in a sharecropper's cabin, and when Zack brings Lucas' wife Molly into his house to care for his son Roth after his wife dies in childbirth, the relationship between the cousins festers to the point of erupting into homicidal violence.  To his credit, Zack comprehends the other's rage.  In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> Faulkner revises Zack's role in the family history a bit: here Lucas lives on his own ten acres in the middle of the plantation, property that Zack has given to him ""and his heirs in perpetuity"" (8).  Zack appears for the last time, very briefly, in Faulkner's last novel, <em>The Reivers</em>.</p>","Yes"
"19026","160","George Wilkins","Wilkins, George","","<p>Like Lucas Beauchamp, George Wilkins is a tenant farmer on the Edmonds plantation who is at times Lucas' rival and at others his assistant; he is also Lucas' son-in-law, though the time at which that happens is hard to pin down.  He appears first in ""A Point of Law,"" as competition for Lucas' moonshine business; Lucas' attempt to foil him lands them both in essentially comic trouble with the law.  Their get-out-of-jail card is the (possibly forged) certificate of marriage between him and Lucas' daughter Nat.  In ""Gold Is Not Always"" he obeys Lucas' orders in a successful scheme to manipulate a white man.  In the first story the judge who oversees the case against him and Lucas calls George a ""jimber-jawed clown"" (223), and that is essentially the way the stories and then the novel <em>Go Down, Moses</em> depict him.  He 'appears' one last time, <em>in absentia</em>, in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>: after his mother-in-law's death George and Nat move to Detroit, making him part of what social historians have called the Great Migration, the movement of six million African Americans from the South to the cities of the North and West.</p>","Yes"
"19025","159","Nat Beauchamp Wilkins","Wilkins, Nat Beauchamp","Molly Worsham Beauchamp, Lucas Quintus Carothers McCaslin Beauchamp","<p>Lucas and Molly's daughter Nat is described in ""A Point of Law"" and again in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> as ""small, thin as a lath, young; she was their youngest and last - seventeen"" (71).  She struggles against her domineering father and with her lazy husband, determined to get what she deserves.  Despite her shrewdness as a bargainer, she can't ultimately overcome her circumstances.  The troubles depicted in those texts are kept in a comic context, and never involve her relationship to the white social system outside her domestic life, but interestingly, the last time she is mentioned is in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>; there, after her mother's death, she moves with her husband to Detroit.  The novel doesn't say any more, either about what made her want to leave or what she found in the city, but her action makes her part of what social historians have called the Great Migration, the 20th century movement of six million African Americans from the South to the cities of the North and West.</p>","Yes"
"19023","157","Henry Beauchamp","Beauchamp, Henry","Molly Worsham Beauchamp, Lucas Quintus Carothers McCaslin Beauchamp","<p>Henry Beauchamp is the oldest child of Lucas and Molly Beauchamp in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>.  He is raised alongside Roth Edmonds as the white child's ""black foster-brother"" (106), just as his father was raised alongside Roth’s father, Zack.  When Roth, however, insists on drawing the color line between them, the seven-year-old Henry accepts the new terms of their relationship, but tells Roth, ""peacefully,"" that ""I aint shamed of nobody . . . Not even me"" (110).</p>","Yes"
"19022","156","Unnamed Son of James Beauchamp's Son","Unnamed Son of James Beauchamp","Tennie&#039;s Jim|James Beauchamp","<p>The young woman who has an affair and a child with Roth Edmonds in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> tells Ike that her father died while his family lived in Indianapolis.  No mention is made of her mother.  One of her ""folks"" is a child of James Beauchamp, and so descended from Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin, but we cannot say definitively that it was her father rather than her mother (343).  (In the magazine version of ""Delta Autumn,"" the young woman and her family are not connected to the McCaslin-Beauchamp-Edmonds family, so her father in that story has his own entry in the database.)</p>","No"
"19021","155","Lucius Quintus Priest I","Priest, Lucius Quintus I","","<p>In <em>The Reivers</em>, his last Yoknapatawpha fiction, Faulkner invents yet another county patriarch along the lines he had laid down with the Sartoris family.  Although ""only fourteen"" when the Civil War began, and so too young to fight or to be directly involved in slave-owning, like Colonel John Sartoris, Lucius Priest was originally from Carolina (278).  Lucius made his way to Mississippi in 1865, where after marrying into the McCaslin family he was already ""distantly"" related to (278), he eventually ""moved in [to town] from McCaslin to become a Jefferson banker"" (118) - like Colonel Sartoris' son Bayard.  His class origins are not as clearly aristocratic; his father serves in Lee's army as a non-commissioned officer.  But in Jefferson the Priest family is clearly as prominent and prestigious as the Sartorises.  Lucius and Bayard's lives are linked by automobiles as well as competing banks, and the narrative links their deaths together as well (30).  Although as ""reivers"" his grandson and namesake Lucius, Boon and Ned are all engaged in a kind of rebellion against him, they also all mention him with great respect and admiration.  And the frequency with which they mention him makes him a major figure in the narrative even though he only appears in person at the beginning and end of the story.</p>","Yes"
"19020","154","Alice Edmonds","Edmonds, Alice","","<p>Alice is the wife of McCaslin (Cass) Edmonds and the mother of Zack Edmonds.   She is mentioned only once in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>: ""[Cass'] wife Alice had taught Fonsiba to read and write too a little"" (263).  (However, in the earlier chapter titled ""The Fire and the Hearth,"" the narrative claims that it was Ike's mother, Sophonsiba, who taught the Beauchamp children to read, 106.)</p>","Yes"
"19019","153","Sarah Edmonds Priest","Priest, Sarah Edmonds","Mrs. Edmonds, Edmonds","<p>Lucius' paternal Grandmother in <em>The Reivers</em> is an Edmonds by birth, which accounts for the fact that the Priests belong to the ""cadet branch"" of the McCaslin-Edmonds family (17).  Married at fifteen, she is now ""just past fifty"" (41).  While afraid at first of the family's new car, she soon learns to enjoy riding in it - until the first (and last) time the wind blows her husband's expectorated tobacco juice into her face.</p>","Yes"
"19018","152","Carothers McCaslin Edmonds","Edmonds, Carothers McCaslin","Edmonds, Mrs. Edmonds","<p>McCaslin Edmonds (also called ""Cass"") is the great-grandson of ""Old Carothers"" McCaslin, the slave-owner who built the large plantation in northeast Yoknapatawpha.  Cass is descended from Old Carothers by the ""distaff"" (5) or female side of the family (his grandmother was Carothers McCaslin's daughter), and would not ordinarily inherit the McCaslin property.  But when Ike McCaslin renounces that inheritance, his cousin Cass comes into possession of it, and in turn he bequeaths it to his son, Zachary Edmonds. He appears in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> as the nine-year-old narrator of ""Was,"" the novel's first chapter, and as Ike's surrogate father in ""The Bear,"" where during a long conversation that revolves around Ike's determination to relinquish the property, they discuss and argue about race and Southern history.  As a defender of the Lost Cause, Cass is trying to talk Ike out of his idea - even at his own expense.  Cass' role in the family history is mentioned briefly in <em>The Town</em> and muddied in Faulkner's last novel, <em>The Reivers</em>, when the narrative mentions a ""McCaslin Edmonds"" who is Zack's father (17) and another ""McCaslin Edmonds"" who is ""Zack's uncle"" (118).  But it's very likely that ""uncle"" was just a lapse on Faulkner's part.</p>","Yes"
"19017","151","Molly Worsham Beauchamp","Beauchamp, Molly Worsham","Unnamed Mother of Molly Worsham Beauchamp, Unnamed Father of Hamp and Mollie","<p>The wife of Lucas Beauchamp figures in five different texts.  In the first two (""A Point of Law"" and ""Gold Is Not Always"") she is unnamed.  In the first one she speaks a thick, essentially mistrelish dialect (""Yawl and your Gawge Wilkins!"" 223), in the second she is only mentioned, once.  In the short story ""Go Down, Moses,"" however, she becomes a character with a biography - she grew up side by side with the privileged white daughter of one of Jefferson's oldest families - and though she is ""a little old Negro woman with a shrunken, incredibly old face beneath a white headcloth and a black straw hat which would have fitted a child"" (257), her stature as the deeply religious, grieving grandmother of a young man who left the plantation she and Lucas live on is morally and emotionally impressive.  Faulkner combined and revised these three stories into <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, where she is ""Molly"" until the final chapter, which calls her ""Mollie.""  <em>Go Down, Moses</em> is dedicated to the black woman, Caroline Barr, who was Faulkner's own ""Mammy""; the praise he bestows on Barr in the novel's Dedication recurs later in the novel in a description of Mollie (113), an extra-textual linkage that gives this character a status unlike any other in the canon.  There are other inconsistencies besides her name in Molly's character in the novel, which remains comic in scenes transposed from the first two stories but becomes even more poignant in some new scenes involving the tension between being a 'mammy' to Roth Edmonds and the wife of Lucas.  Given how hard it is to get her character into <em>a</em> focus, it is interesting that in her last appearance, in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, she is presented and re-presented simultaneously when a young white boy is confronted with the contrast between her appearance in person as ""a tiny almost doll-sized woman"" who is wearing ""an immaculate white cloth on her head"" (10) - a completely familiar image for a white southerner in Faulkner's time - and a large mounted photograph of her in the same room, outside that socially imposed costume and culturally defined character, looking ""like nobody he has ever seen before"" (14).  That moment of cognitive dissonance marks the beginning of this young boy's re-education, and makes Molly a potentially subversive figure.</p>","Yes"
"19016","150","Unnamed Husband of Fonsiba","Unnamed Husband of Fonsiba","Unnamed Father of Fonsiba&#039;s Husband","<p>The man who marries Fonsiba in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> looks and talks ""like a white man,"" though he is a Negro ""from the North,"" where he has lived ""since a child"" (261).  He owns a farm in Arkansas, which he inherited from his father, who acquired it in return for his ""military service"" during the Civil War in what McCaslin calls ""the Yankee army"" but which Fonsiba's future husband corrects to ""the United States army"" (261).  He dresses carefully, in ""ministerial"" clothing, though the narrative calls attention to the emptiness of his pretensions - for example, he wears a ""pair of gold-framed spectacles"" to read, but ""they did not even contain lenses"" (265).  He seems to live mainly off his father's pension.  At least, when Ike traces Fonsiba to the Arkansas farm, he is dismayed to find it a ""waste of unfenced fallow and wilderness jungle - no barn, no stable, not so much as a hencoop"" (264).</p>","Yes"
"19015","149","Lucas Quintus Carothers McCaslin Beauchamp","Beauchamp, Lucas Quintus Carothers McCaslin","Tennie Beauchamp, Tomey&#039;s Turl","<p>Lucas Beauchamp appears in seven fictions, all written after 1940.  In Faulkner's last published novel, <em>The Reivers</em>, he is only mentioned, but the brief description of him there that one white character gives another sums him up well: ""except for color,"" Lucas ""looked (and behaved: just as arrogant, just as iron-headed, just as intolerant) exactly like"" Lucius the first, the patriarch of the McCaslin family who is both Lucas' grandfather and his great-grandfather (223), and whom Lucas himself claims as his birthright.  As he puts it, proudly, in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, ""I am a McCaslin"" (19).  Of course, you cannot escape 'color' in the world Faulkner represents, and the fact that Lucas is the result of that first McCaslin's sexual affairs with one of his slaves and then, fifteen years later, with his own enslaved daughter, while it means Lucas has more 'McCaslin blood' in him than any of the white descendants, also means that he is not recognized as ""a McCaslin"" legally or socially or in any way that might give him rights as an heir.  He lives his whole life as a sharecropper on the McCaslin-Edmonds plantation.  In the fictions, however, his character undergoes considerable evolution.  In the first two stories in which he appears, ""A Point of Law"" and ""Gold Is Not Always,"" he speaks in a very thick 'Negro' dialect and is cast in an essentially comic part as a schemer whose schemes seldom prosper but do exasperate the family relative, Roth Edmonds, on whose land he labors.  When Faulkner combined those stories and two more in which Lucas is mentioned, into the novel <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, he retained the comic misadventures but added a number of new episodes in which, for one of the first times in his career, he used his imagination and his capacity for empathy to occupy the space that Jim Crow culture forced a black man to inhabit.  The results of this are even more impressive in <em>Intruder</em>.  There Lucas owns ten acres of land that Zack Edmonds gave him in the middle of their plantation, and on that space Lucas lives as a man who refuses to accept the racist terms laid down by the segregated society around him despite the longing of ""every white man"" in Beat Four (as Chick McCaslin puts it with a crudeness that reminds us of how demeaning those terms were) ""to make a nigger out of him"" (18, 31). The novel describes him with adjectives like ""friendless opinionated arrogant hardheaded intractable independent"" (76) ""damned highnosed [and] impudent"" (148). In jail and on the verge of being lynched for a murder he didn't commit, he finds a way to save himself and to expose the real killer. Although offstage for most of the narrative, he is probably Faulkner's most impressive African American character.</p>","Yes"
"19014","148","Sophonsiba Beauchamp","Beauchamp, Sophonsiba","Tomey&#039;s Turl, Tennie Beauchamp","<p>In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> Fonsiba Beauchamp is the fifth child of Tomey’s Turl and Tennie Beauchamp.  She is named Sophonsiba after white mistress of the plantation where Tennie was enslaved.  In 1886, at the age of seventeen, she marries a Northern black, and moves with him to a farm in Arkansas, where Ike McCaslin finds her and arranges for her $1000 inheritance to be issued to her in monthly installments.  Although Ike attempts to remove her from the squalor of her new life in Arkansas, her priorities are evident in the two words she offers in return: ""I'm free"" (267).</p>","Yes"
"19013","147","Tennie's Jim|James Beauchamp","Tennie's Jim|James Beauchamp","Tennie Beauchamp, Tomey&#039;s Turl","<p>Although always a minor character, this black man reveals a lot about how Faulkner's imagination led him into and out of the haunted issue of slavery and its legacy.  In his first published appearance he is ""Tennie's Jim"" in the hunting story ""The Bear""; in that character he's a revised version of ""Jimbo,"" one of the servants Major de Spain takes with him in ""The Old People"" on his annual hunting trips into the big woods.  He assists the camp's cook, ""pours whisky from the demijohn into the tin dipper"" of the ""Brunswick stew"" (287), tends the fire, and ""passes the bottle"" among the white hunters (293).  He's still ""Tennie's Jim"" and still playing that menial role when he first re-appears in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, but tracing the tangled thread of his character through the complete narrative shows how Faulkner evolved the novel from a set of previously published short stories and from his own awakened interest in the stories of the black inhabitants of Yoknapatawpha.  In the book's central chapter, ""The Bear,"" it's ""Tennie's Jim"" who appears in sections 1, 2 and 3, mostly in the woods but once at the Edmonds-McCaslin place (220), although there he remains just one of the family's black servants. However, in the new material that Faulkner wrote for the novel (Section 4 of ""The Bear""),  he includes a black character named ""James Beauchamp"": he is the fourth child of Tomey’s Turl and Tennie Beauchamp, which makes him a part of the McCaslin family. Born a slave in 1864 (259), James left Yoknapatawpha and ""vanished sometime on night of his twenty-first birthday"" (260), without claiming the $1000 inheritance left by Lucius McCaslin, the white slave-owner who was his grandfather and great-grandfather. The novel makes no explicit connection between the black servant in the woods (""Tennie's Jim"") and the exiled biracial child of the McCaslin family (James Beauchamp) until its second to last chapter, ""Delta Autumn."" There his granddaughter arrives at the white hunters' camp in the Delta woods and in a pointed moment identifies ""James Beauchamp"" as her grandfather, telling Ike McCaslin that ""you called him Tennie's Jim though he had a name"" (343).   It is almost as if Faulkner is reproaching himself.  He appears again, one last time, in Faulkner's last book, <em>The Reivers</em>.  Unfortunately, that text returns him to the role of servant.  Here too he has a grandchild, but Bobo Beauchamp is a much more stereotypical figure than that woman in ""Delta Autumn.""  This novel never mentions the fact that ""Tennie's Jim"" has that other name, and is the grandson of Lucius McCaslin.</p>","Yes"

"19009","143","Mrs. Isaac McCaslin","McCaslin, Mrs. Isaac","","<p>Isaac McCaslin's ""dead wife"" is very briefly referred to in ""Delta Autumn.""  <em>Go Down, Moses</em> evokes her from the start, by identifying Ike as a ""widower"" twice on its first page (5).  His wife - who may be the daughter of the bank president who hires Ike and his partner to put a new roof on his stable - remains in the background for most of the novel, but in her brief appearances Faulkner emphasizes her hostility, as Ike meets her ""tense bitter indomitable voice"" with a posture of familiarity (104).  Ike's wife considers the McCaslin plantation Ike's property, and her husband a fool for handing it over to Cass Emonds.  When Ike first meets her, ""an only child, a small girl yet curiously bigger than she seemed at first . . . with dark eyes and a passionate heart-shaped face,"" she makes her ambition clear to the reader, if not to Ike: ""Papa told me about you.  That farm is really yours, isn't it?"" (296).  The naked truth about her desire, however, is revealed to Ike in the chapter called ""The Bear"" (296-300); that's when he really ""lost her"" (335), as he sadly muses in the novel's revised version of ""Delta Autumn.""</p>","Yes"

The novel doesn't allow us to decide between these alternatives.  All it says about this character is that she died, presumably when her son was very young: his grandmother, McCaslin's daughter, ""raised him following his mother's death"" (9).</p>","Yes"

The first Edmonds in this line may have been the man who married that daughter, or could just as easily be the man who married the daughter of that daughter - the novel provides no information about the sequence, nor any information at all about this man.  The novel does say that Cass Edmonds, the grandson of Lucius McCaslin's daughter, ""bears his father's name,"" that is, Edmonds (9, 43) - but whether that was also the name of Cass' grandfather cannot be determined.</p>","Yes"
"19006","140","Isaac McCaslin","McCaslin, Isaac","Sophonsiba Beauchamp McCaslin, Theophilus McCaslin 1","<p>Few characters in the Yoknapatawpha canon are as protean as Isaac (Uncle Ike) McCaslin.  If you only read ""A Bear Hunt"" (1934), ""Lion"" (1935), ""The Old People"" (1940), <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> (1948) and ""Race at Morning"" (1955), Uncle Ike is one of the men who are part of the annual hunting parties into the big woods.  He's a very accomplished woodsman - as the narrator of the last story on that list puts it, ""he had been hunting deer in these woods for about a hundred years, I reckon, and if anybody would know where a buck would pass, it would be him"" (297) - but in those texts neither 'hunting' nor Uncle Ike have a larger significance.  If you read only ""Fool about a Horse"" (1934), <em>The Town</em> (1957) and <em>The Mansion</em> (1960), you would think of Isaac essentially as a merchant, owner of a hardware store in Jefferson.  But if you read <em>Go Down, Moses</em> (and you should!), you know Ike as a major character who belongs at what could be called Faulkner's 'Round Table,' where you find the sons of the old plantation aristocracy who take on the sins of their fathers and of the South in a quest for social justice.  Quentin Compson, for instance, confronts that legacy in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, and the part Ike ends up with when Faulkner revised ""Lion"" and ""The Old People"" for <em>Go Down, Moses</em> was originally played by Quentin.  As someone who has already committed suicide at age twenty in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, however, Quentin cannot ultimately give Faulkner a way to move through the past toward a new future.   When a ten-year-old Ike begins his apprenticeship with Sam Fathers, himself a victim of that past, hunting and the wilderness open up the possibility of a spiritually redemptive world outside time, and in particular outside Southern history.  When Ike chooses to renounce his McCaslin inheritance - a Southern plantation haunted by the curse of slavery - he announces that ""Sam Fathers set me free"" (285).  The price of that freedom goes beyond the material one: although in earlier texts he has children, when he sacrifices his inheritance he becomes ""husband but no father, unwidowered but without a wife"" (268).  Even with that sacrifice, unfortunately, Ike's story in <em>Moses</em> doesn't end with his freedom.  In the first publication of ""Delta Autumn,"" Uncle Ike is a minor character.  In the revised ""Delta Autumn"" chapter in the novel, he's the central character; he's back in the woods, but if earlier that realm had promised a way to transcend the legacy of slavery and racism, here it becomes the setting where Ike essentially repeats the past.  Ike remains alive throughout the fictions; he's over 90 in his last appearances.  Faulkner's very last novel mentions him three times, recalling all the parts he plays across the Yoknapatawpha saga.  He is ""the best woodsman and hunter this county ever had"" and the merchant who owns the hardware store on Courthouse Square (14) and the quixotic hero who ""abdicated the McCaslin plantation"" (17).   But as in the other texts that precede or follow <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the role he plays in <em>The Reivers</em> is a very small one.</p>","Yes"
"19005","139","Tennie Beauchamp","Beauchamp, Tennie","","<p>Tennie was born a slave and worked on the Beauchamp plantation. In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> she is won in a card game by Buddy McCaslin, and brings the surname ""Beauchamp"" with her when she comes to the McCaslin plantation and marries a McCaslin slave (and half-brother to Buddy and Buck McCaslin) named Tomey's Turl.  Together they have six children, three of whom - James (""Tennie's Jim""), Sophonsiba (""Fonsiba""), and Lucas - survive into adulthood. Also at the McCaslin place, she nurses the infant Ike McCaslin.

The name by which he is known, Tomey’s Turl, instead of simply Terrel, underscores his ties to his mother, Tomey, but Hubert Beauchamp puts in words the paternal identity that makes white men nervous around Tomey's Turl: he is ""that damn white half-McCaslin"" (7). And actually, as Ike discovers in the plantation ledgers, he is 'three-quarters' McCaslin, though his incestuous origin is not ever mentioned explicitly. Tomey’s Turl is a slave on the McCaslin plantation owned by his half-brothers/uncles Amodeus and Theophilus. Tomey’s Turl marries Tennie, from the Beauchamp plantation, with whom he has six children, including Lucas Beauchamp.  In <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, where Lucas is a major character, his father is referred to - but not named - as ""one of old Carothers McCaslin's"" slaves and ""his son too"" (7); the darkest part of his story, that as a result of incest as well as miscegenation he is <em>also</em> the grandson of old Carothers, is not mentioned.  (There is also a ""Tomey's Turl"" in Faulkner's later novel, The Town [1957], but he was born about 50 years later; the relationship between these two characters, if any, is not explained.)</p>","Yes"

Cass is more fascinated by her ""roan tooth"" any other aspect of her character (12), but even from his naive perspective it's clear how determined she is to marry Buck McCaslin.

She is at the head of the ""distaff"" side of the white McCaslins (5), ""the woman"" through whom Cass inherits both McCaslin blood, and, since Ike renounces his inheritance, the McCaslin property (243).

"19000","134","Amodeus (Buddy) McCaslin","McCaslin, Amodeus (Buddy)","Mrs. Carothers McCaslin, Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin","<p>Amodeus (Uncle Buddy) McCaslin is the son of Old Carothers McCaslin and the twin brother of Theophilus (Uncle Buck).  He is an outstanding poker player, a good cook and housekeeper, and a less significant presence in the fiction that his brother.  During the Civil War present of <em>The Unvanquished</em> Buddy is in Virginia fighting in Tennant's brigade after beating his brother in a card game for the privilege of serving in the Confederate regiment that was raised in Yoknapatawpha.  But a passage that Faulkner wrote for the novel and interpolated into the ""Retreat"" chapter describes in some detail the ""ideas about social relationships"" between classes and races that shows how both brothers were ""ahead of their time"" (48).  Buddy appears most vividly in the ""Was"" chapter of <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, where his poker prowess is again called upon.  As Old Carothers' sons and Ike McCaslin's immediate ancestors (Buddy is his uncle, Buck his father) they maintain the plantation ledgers where in the fourth section of ""The Bear"" chapter, the adolescent Ike hopes to learn more about ""his own flesh and blood"" (254).  What he finds is a terrible truth about his family past, and it seems potentially significant that he learns to distinguish Buddy's handwriting from Buck's  just at the moment when he first begins to realize that truth (253).  Apparently Buddy is the first brother to realize what their father has done to his own (enslaved) daughter.  However, the elliptical notes the twins write each other in that ledger give readers a lot of interpretive room to decide how either brother feels about their father's monstrous actions.</p>","Yes"
"18999","133","Theophilus McCaslin 1","McCaslin, Theophilus 1","Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin, Mrs. Carothers McCaslin","<p>Theophilus McCaslin - better know as ""Uncle Buck"" - is a son of Old Carothers McCaslin, the twin brother of Buddy, and the father of Ike.  While Buddy appears in only two texts, Buck is present or mentioned in ten of them.  He is actually called ""Theophilus"" when he attends the burial of Charles Bon in <em>Absalom!</em> and sends him off as a ""Confedrit soldier"" (122); the passage contains no hint of the larger McCaslin family or this man's place in it.  But in the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories that Faulkner had already begun to publish while writing <em>Absalom!</em> Faulkner is clearly beginning to imagine that larger narrative.  Buddy is away from Yoknapatawpha, serving as a Confederate sergeant in Virginia, but in Bayard's accounts of the Sartorises during the war Buck becomes an increasingly important element, appearing in ""Raid"" before joining Bayard and Ringo in ""Vendee"" on a quasi-military mission of their own - not against Yankees but against an outlaw named Gumby.  When Faulkner revised the stories into the novel <em>The Unvanquished</em>, he adds the detail that the McCaslins ""have a big bottom-land plantation about fifteen miles from town"" (46), and describes in some detail the advanced ideas about slavery and class that the brothers are putting into practice on that plantation.  Buck is also mentioned, briefly, in <em>The Hamlet</em>.  But it is in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> that he plays the most significant role, though it's an abstract one.  How he became Ike's father - how he and Sophonsiba Beauchamp became man and wife - is a story that remains untold.  But the ledgers that Buck and his brother kept about the affairs of the slave plantation they inherited from their father lead Ike to realize how cursed is his inheritance; that is the story, written in the hands of his father and his uncle, about a father and a daughter as well as fathers and sons, that gives the various parts of the novel's narrative an extremely powerful, dark center to revolve around.  The novel, however, doesn't shine enough light into that past to let us see how Buck responds to the truth his son learns at secondhand.  Buck makes one last appearance in Faulkner's last novel.  Faulkner revises the story there to make Buck rather than Buddy the brother who served during the Civil War.</p>","Yes"

Eunice was bought by Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin in New Orleans in 1807 for $650.  Although she is never physically described, our decision to identify her race as 'Mixed' rather than 'Black' is based on the extravagant amount of money Old Carothers paid for her on the New Orleans slave market, which is associated elsewhere in Faulkner with the sale of quadroons as concubines to wealthy white men.  She is already pregnant with Carothers McCaslin's child when he marries her to Thucydus, another slave on the McCaslin plantation.

It is her Bible that Ned, the only one of her husband's illegitimate and biracial descendants who is named McCaslin rather than Beauchamp, carries in his bag - a symbolic gesture that is extremely interesting and opaque.  Lucius identifies her as ""Great-great-grandmother McCaslin"" (69), but based on the McCaslin genealogy as developed in detail in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, he should have added one more ""great.""</p>","Yes"
"18995","129","Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin","McCaslin, Lucius Quintus Carothers","","<p>Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin - often referred to as ""Old Carothers"" - was one of Yoknapatawpha's earliest and wealthiest white settlers, the slave-owning patriarch of the racially diverse family that Faulkner puts at the center of two novels: <em>Go Down, Moses</em> and <em>The Reivers</em>. In two other texts - <em>The Unvanquished</em> and <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> he is a minor presence.  He himself is never physically present in any of these four novels, having died well before the Civil War, but his legacies - material and moral - haunt many of his descendants on both sides of the color line. This is especially the case in <em>Moses</em>, where the 'black' branch of his family, the Beauchamps, is the result not just of miscegenation and concubinage but incest, when he has sex with his own enslaved daughter.  ""Old Carothers"" is one of the most powerful examples in the fiction of how, as Faulkner famously put it, ""the past is never dead.""  He is also ""an evil and unregenerate old man"" (280), and as such a radical re-vision of the figure of the Old Southern planter, the type that Faulkner had originally embodied in the glamorous Colonel Sartoris.  When Faulkner returns to the extended McCaslin family in his last novel, this 'past' is not dead, but it is revised.  Although <em>The Reivers</em> also includes a ""family skeleton"" (31), its re-presentation of the sins of the father is much less dark, and his ""actual grandson,"" though illegitimate and biracial, is a newly created character who is conceived without any hint of incest (126).</p>","Yes"

"18990","127","Unnamed Granddaughter of Issetibbeha|Mohataha","Unnamed Granddaughter of Issetibbeha|Mohataha","","<p>This is one of the several Faulkner characters whose inconsistencies cannot be reconciled.  In the short story ""A Name for the City,"" it is this unnamed granddaughter of <em>Issetibbeha</em> who marries a white man, Doctor Habersham's son; together the couple ""emigrated to Oklahoma"" in ""the thirties"" (i.e. the 1830s) along with the rest of the Chickasaws (202).  In the prose introduction to Act I in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, the Chickasaw woman who marries Doctor Habersham's son and ""emigrates"" with him to Oklahoma in the 1830's is identified as ""one of Issetibbeha's grand-daughters"" (7).  In the prose introduction to Act 3, however, the ""bride"" of Doctor Habersham's son is ""Mohataha's grand-daughter"" and the daughter of Ikkemotubbe (170).  Issetibbeha and Mohataha are siblings, but there is no suggestion of incest, and therefore no explanation for the inconsistency except as a lapse of Faulkner's memory.  The additional genealogical detail in the second reference to her - that Ikkemotubbe is her father - strengthens the idea of her as Mohataha's granddaughter.</p>","Yes"

He should have grown up to succeed his father as the chief of the tribe.  However, in all three texts he dies within the same sentence in which he is first mentioned and within a few days after Ikkemotubbe, his father's cousin, returns to the tribe from New Orleans with a white powder that kills at least a puppy - and probably, though none of the texts say so explicitly, this child.

"18985","123","Unnamed Enslaved Grandmother|Mother of Sam Fathers","Unnamed Enslaved Grandmother|Mother of Sam Fathers","","<p>The woman who is the mother of Sam Fathers appears in four texts, though never as exactly the same person; her character changes as Faulkner's idea of the character Sam Fathers changes.  In ""A Justice,"" Sam is the son a slave whom Doom wins on a steamboat; she is married to another slave, but forced into a sexual relationship with one of the Indians, Crawford, who is the biological father of Sam.  The next time she appears, it is actually as ""Sam's grandmother"" (202), though it's possible that Faulkner meant her to be his mother; again she is a slave owned by Doom and, in this text, impregnated by him, so that Sam is the (illegitimate) son of a Chickasaw chief.  Doom forces her to marry another slave, then sells all three - including Sam - to the great-grandfather of the story's white narrator. In ""The Bear,"" she is ""a slave woman"" who was impregnated by a Chickasaw chief (282).  In <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, by adding one word to her description, Faulkner gives Sam a different racial identity.  In this text Sam's mother is a ""quadroon slave woman"" (157). A ""quadroon,"" in the dictinary of Faulkner's South, is someone with three white and one black grandparents.   Legally Sam is still a 'Negro,' but being the son of this mother means that he has four times as much 'Indian blood' and three times as much 'white blood' as 'Negro blood' - though of course all human blood is the same color.

She is described as having ""broad, solid thighs,"" a ""sound back"" and a ""serene face"" (321).  Her race is not specified.  Our identification of her as ""Black"" and ""Enslaved"" (rather than ""Indian"" and ""Tribal Member"") is based on her clothing (a ""shift"") and the fact that she is engaged in field labor, along with the way seeing her reminds Issetibbeha of his ""own mother,"" with ""her Negro blood"" (321).

She is mainly white, but when her son Issetibbeha remembers her a few pages later, the narrative explicitly refers to ""her Negro blood"" (321).  Given the casualness of the later reference, Faulkner might have expected his readers to read the designation ""West Indian"" as code for racial mixing in the first description, though that's by no means certain.  ""Six months"" after Doom leaves her in New Orleans, and pregnant with Doom's child (318), this unnamed ""city woman"" follows him to the Indian plantation in Yoknapatawpha, where they marry (321).</p>","Yes"

"18974","114","Sam Fathers","Fathers, Sam","Ikkemotubbe, Unnamed Enslaved Grandmother|Mother of Sam Fathers","<p>This is not the Indian named ""Had-Two-Fathers"" who plays a minor role in ""Red Leaves.""  This is the character best known as Sam Fathers, though as he tells Quentin Compson in Faulkner's second Indian story, ""A Justice,"" his Indian name was ""Had-Two-Fathers"" too (345).  In that story he is the child of a Choctaw named Crawfish-ford and an enslaved woman whom Doom, the chief, won gambling on a Mississippi riverboat.  In later fictions he is first the grandson and then the son of Ikkemotubbe; making his father a Chickasaw chief raises his imaginative status in the class-conscious world of Faulkner's fiction.  His mother is usually identified only as ""a Negro slave"" (""The Bear,"" 294), but in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, the text that gives him his most prominent role, she is identified as a ""quadroon"" slave (158) - that is, someone who has three white grandparents; giving Sam this 'white blood' (as the fictions put it) along with his Negro and Indian ancestry symbolically makes his very body the site of Yoknapatawpha's conflicted racial history.  The story Sam tells Quentin in ""A Justice"" - about the injustices of slavery and race that gave him existence in the first place and that then determined the alienated existence he has led as someone whose Indian culture has vanished and who has no home in either the black or the white cultures that remain - is very powerful, and leaves a very young Quentin in a world that feels ""faintly sinister"" (360).  This anticipates the way the story of Sutpen and the Southern past will haunt Quentin in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>  But in the larger Yoknapatawpha canon, Sam's role is to provide Quentin and then Ike McCaslin, another son of the plantation aristocracy, with a possible path to a better world, a place outside the injustices of Southern history, outside time itself: the big woods.  As Ike puts it in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, ""Sam Fathers set me free"" (285).  In short stories that are revised and incorporated into that novel, Sam fathers first Quentin and then Ike by initiating them into the lessons taught by the wilderness as a spiritual realm and by hunting as a way of being a man.  Ultimately Sam's role is the mythic one of the holy teacher, but in more culturally specific terms it recalls the trope of 19th-century American romanticism, and the redemptive relationships outside social and racial conventions between Cooper's Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook or Melville's Ishmael and Queequeg.  But it has to be noted that Faulkner comes too late to that trope to deploy it uncritically; the hunting camp where Sam shows Quentin or Ike 'the way' is in the woods, but in Faulkner's fiction it is also already inside the bloody human past, as the exact spot where Wash Jones had to kill Thomas Sutpen.</p>","Yes"
"18973","113","Moketubbe","Moketubbe","Issetibbeha, Unnamed Mother of Moketubbe","<p>In five texts Moketubbe is the son of Issetibbeha, and so, according to Faulkner's representation of Indian society, the heir to the title of 'The Man,' or chief of the tribe that lives in Yoknapatawpha when the white settlers begin arriving. The only one that shows him as the chief is ""Red Leaves,"" Faulkner's first 'Indian story,' which begins after the death of his father.  In that story he is an extremely unprepossessing young man, characterized by phrases like his ""monstrous shape"" (327) and ""diseased with flesh"" (321) and whose ""complete and unfathomable lethargy"" (320) seems to be a form of retardation.  He is obsessed with the pair of ""slippers with red heels"" that his father brought back from Paris before he was born (318).  Once he gains possession of these shoes, perhaps by killing his father, he shows no interest in fulfilling any of his responsibilities as chief.  Although <em>Go Down, Moses</em> refers to him as ""Doom's fat cousin"" (158), the other four stories that mention him do not describe him as 'diseased,' just very prudent.  In them his role is essentially defined by the speed with which he abdicates his position to avoid being killed by his cousin.</p>","Yes"
"18972","112","Ikkemotubbe","Ikkemotubbe","Mohataha","<p>The Choctaw|Chickasaw chief Ikkemotubbe appears in fourteen texts, more than any of the other Indian characters in the fictions.  His significance in most of them is either as Sam Fathers' father or as the chief who sold or traded Indian land to white settlers like Compson and Sutpen, but his own story is a fascinating one.  It is first told - in two pages! - in ""Red Leaves"": he is the son of the chief's sister who travels to New Orleans, where he acquires his soubriquet ""Doom"" from a decadent French aristocrat and a child from the ""daughter of a fairly well-to-do West Indian family,"" then returns to Yoknapatawpha to become the chief himself after ""his uncle and cousin both die"" (318).  His own role, if any, in their deaths is not explained.  In that story Issetibbeha is his son.  In ""A Justice,"" one of the two stories that feature him as a major character, Issetibbeha is his uncle, and the ruthless means by which Ikkemotubbe clears his male relatives out of his path to power is described explicitly.  As the chief - ""The Man,"" in the Indians' vocabulary - he is a despot, treating his tribe and the slaves they own as instruments of his will.  More than once Faulkner explains how he became ""Doom"": that aristocratic Frenchman assumed he was already 'The Man,' which according to Faulkner translates into the French ""<em>du homme</em>,"" which is anglicized into ""Doom."" Several of the retellings make a point of saying that it was then Ikkemotubbe who choose to take that name as his own.  He thus becomes an ironist like the author who created him.  For Faulkner, Ikkemotubbe's fierce determination to rule plays out against his own inevitable dispossession by the larger forces of history.  But if Ikkemotubbe <em>is</em> doomed, like his culture and like so many other Faulkner characters, at least he can write his own epitaph with economy and wit.  The other story in which he's a major character is ""A Courtship,"" where he cannot escape the less portentous irony of defeating a romantic rival in a kind of frontier tall tale test of strength only to be defeated when the object of his desire chooses an artist instead of him.  That story is the last of Faulkner's 'Indian tales,' and set before Ikkemotubbe leaves for New Orleans.  It complicates this biographical sketch by describing him not as the feared potential regicide but as a beloved member of his tribe - ""one of the young men, the best one"" (363).  Perhaps, however, we are meant to think that his frustration at the hands of Herman Basket's sister is the seed out of which his ruthlessness grows.</p>","Yes"
"18971","111","Mohataha","Mohataha","","<p>In the first five texts that mention this character, she is referred to as either ""The Man's|Issetibbeha's sister"" or ""Ikkemotubbe's|Doom's mother.""  She is a member of the family of chiefs in the tribe of Indians who lived in Yoknapatawpha when the white settlers began arriving, but Faulkner defines the tribe (variously called Choctaw or Chickasaw) as patriarchal, and so as a woman neither she nor her son is in the direct line of succession.  How her son becomes ""The Man,"" as the chief is ceremonially titled, is a story Faulkner often re-tells, but over the course of the 9 texts in which Doom's mother appears - beginning with ""Red Leaves"" (1930) and ending with <em>The Mansion</em> (1960) - her place in the culture of the tribe and the saga of Yoknapatawpha becomes more powerful.  In the sixth text in which she appears - <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> (1951), Faulkner's most sustained account of the settlement's early existence - she is finally given a name and is referred to as the ""Chickasaw matriarch""  (210).  Even in that role, however, her story is still constrained, in this case by the historical circumstance of dispossession and exile: after signing ""all the conveyances as her son's kingdom passed to the white people"" (17), she leads the tribe away to the land they have been promised west of the Mississippi, riding ""in a wagon behind two mules, under a silver-handled Paris parisol held by a female slave child"" (25). And in her last appearance Faulkner misremembers the name he had given her: <em>The Mansion</em> calls her Mahataha instead of Mohataha (367).  (A number of scholars have noted how the Mahataha|Mohataha of these late texts is loosely derived from a real Chickasaw matriarch named Hota, who similarly signed land conveyances for much of the property in Oxford, Mississippi.)  She is also either the great-grandmother (in ""The Old People"") or (in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>) the grandmother of Sam Fathers, but not named in either case.</p>","Yes"
"18970","110","Issetibbeha","Issetibbeha","Ikkemotubbe","<p>Issetibbeha is a chief of the tribe of Indians who are living in Yoknapatawpha when the white settlers arrive.  The Indians are called Choctaws in Faulkner's earlier fictions, and Chickasaws, the more historically appropriate name, in the later ones.  Issetibbeha is identified as the son of Doom (AKA Ikkemotubbe) in the earliest 'Indian story,"" ""Red Leaves,"" but later becomes Ikkemotubbe's uncle - although at one point in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> he is identified as ""Ikkemotubbe's father old Issetibbeha"" (245).  He is consistently identified as the father of Moketubbe.  Moketubbe does succeed him as the chief in ""Red Leaves,"" and may even have killed him to gain that title and the ""shoes with red heels"" that, along with other decadent artifacts of European high culture, Issetibbeha brings back to the woods from a trip to Paris (316).  ""Red Leaves"" goes into the most detail about Issetibbeha's life and character, as he finds himself caught between the traditions of his culture and seductions of the white world that arrives with the incoming settlers' European ways, their material wealth, their African slaves and their determination to own the land. ""A Courtship"" notes that he is the chief, ""the Man,"" who signs the treaty with General Jackson that formalizes the process of dispossession (361). In the other seven fictions that mention him, he is essentially a totemic figure for that idea of loss.</p>","Yes"

S-V.","","<p>The ""inescapably negro"" woman whom Charles Etienne Saint-Valery Bon marries in <em>Absalom!</em> (168) is apparently somewhat mentally deficient; at least, ""her mentality"" is mentioned disparagingly (167), and she is described as ""existing"" in an ""automaton-like state"" (166).  The phrase ""inescapably negro"" is attributed to Judith; the phrases that Mr. Compson uses to describe her include ""coal black and ape-like"" (166); ""resembling something in a zoo"" (169), and ""the black gargoyle"" (170).  She is from a ""two dimensional backwater"" somewhere (166) outside Yoknapatawpha, and is already pregnant when she and Bon come to Sutpen's Hundred to live.  She is not mentioned again after her husband's death, but since Clytemnestra assumes guardianship of her child, it seems likely that she also dies - though there is no stone for her in the Sutpen graveyard.</p>","Yes"

"18945","107","Milly Jones","Jones, Milly","Wash Jones&#039; Daughter|Melicent","<p>Milly Jones appears in both ""Wash"" and <em>Absalom!</em> as the poor white and illegitimate grandaughter of Wash, who is described in the novel's ""Genealogy"" as a ""hanger-on of Sutpen"" (308).  She is ""eight-years-old"" when first mentioned in the short story, and an ""infant"" when first mentioned in the novel (536, 99).  In both texts she is ""a fifteen-year-old gal,"" as Wash puts it in the story, when Sutpen begins a kind of courtship of her, and ""already mature [i.e. sexually], after the early way of her kind"" (541).  Sutpen's intentions are complex but dishonorable: he seeks a son to replace the one he has lost.  During Milly's pregnancy in <em>Absalom!</em> Sutpen's daughter actually helps sew a wedding dress for her, to be worn when she gives birth to that son.  This is the second wedding dress Judith sews in the novel; neither is ever worn.  When Milly's newborn turns out to be a girl, Sutpen dismisses her with a contemptuous insult that results in death for him, for Wash, for her, and for her child.   Readers never get a clear sense of how Milly herself feels about any of this, but there is no suggestion in either text that Milly ever has any control over what happens to her.</p>","Yes"
"18944","106","Wash Jones' Daughter|Melicent","Jones, Daughter of Wash|Melicent","Wash Jones","<p>The ""daughter"" of Wash Jones and the mother of Milly is not named either in the short story ""Wash,"" were she is first mentioned (536), or in <em>Absalom!</em>, where she plays a somewhat more visible role, but she has her own entry as ""MELICENT JONES"" in the ""Genealogy"" at the end of the novel (308).  In the novel itself, she lives with her father for some years in the ""abandoned"" fishing camp at Sutpen's (99). The daughter she gives birth to there is ""fatherless"" (139).  Rosa tells Quentin that she ""heard once"" that this woman ""died in a Memphis brothel"" (139) - a ""rumor"" which the Genealogy repeats (308).</p>","Yes"
"18943","105","Wash Jones","Jones, Wash","","<p>The title character of ""Wash"" can hardly be called its hero, but his story there and again in <em>Absalom!</em> acquires great moral force before it ends in blood and fire.  Described in the novel as a ""gaunt gangling man malaria-ridden with pale eyes and a face that might have been any age between twenty-five and sixty"" (69), he survives as a ""hanger-on of Sutpen,"" the richest planter in Yoknapatawpha (308).  While most of the white men of the county are off fighting in the Civil War, Wash remains on the plantation, often being laughed at by the slaves for his apparent cowardice while in his own mind believing that he is taking care of the place in Sutpen's absence.  Though he is not allowed to enter the mansion house, and is treated with contempt by other characters as a ""brute"" and ""that brute progenitor of brutes"" - to quote Rosa Coldfield in the novel (107) - he admires ""the fine figure of the man"" that Sutpen makes on his horse (226), and feels even a kind of pride when, after the War, Sutpen impregnates his fifteen-year-old granddaughter Milly, sure that a man of Sutpen's status will behave honorably.  His devout faith in that ""fine figure,"" however, and in the Southern cause that men like Sutpen epitomized, is destroyed after Milly gives birth to a daughter instead of the son Sutpen wants.  The vengeance that Wash takes has its own unconventional nobility, although he and all that remains of his family perish along with Sutpen.</p>","Yes"

He arrived in Jefferson from Tennessee half a decade before Sutpen, with a single wagonload of merchandise as the basis for his business.  Mr. Compson calls him a ""queer silent man whose only companion and friend seems to have been his conscience"" (47), though apparently he compromises that when he and Sutpen work a mysterious deal that provides the rich furnishings for Sutpen's mansion.  When he acquires two slaves ""though a debt . . . not purchase"" (68), he immediately manumits them, but withholds their free papers until as servants they earn the equivalent of their market value.   During the Civil War he nails himself inside the attic of his house, where Rosa provides him with food until his death.  Early on the narrative calls him ""a conscientious objector on religious grounds"" (6), but later it is suggested that the basis of his objection was not scriptural, but mercantile: ""the idea of waste: of wearing out and eating up and shooting away material in any cause whatsoever"" (65).  The name ""Coldfield"" appears again twice in the fictions, on lists of the ""oldest names in the county"" (""Appendix Compsons,"" 330) and of the ""new names"" that began appearing not long after the first settlers arrived in Jefferson (<em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, 8).</p>","Yes"
"18941","103","Ellen Coldfield Sutpen","Sutpen, Ellen Coldfield","Goodhue Coldfield","<p>This character is barely mentioned as ""Mrs. Sutpen,"" Thomas' only wife, in ""Wash,"" but as Ellen Coldfield Sutpen, his second wife in <em>Absalom!</em>, she presents a different image of the plantation mistress than someone like Rosa Millard, who presides over the Sartoris plantation in <em>The Unvanquished</em>.  In <em>Absalom!</em> Ellen is the daughter of a merchant.  She is described as ""small-boned"" but also ""what is known as fullbodied"" (51). According to the storytellers, Sutpen marries her to gain respectability. The novel does not speculate on why she married Sutpen, but it describes her as very happy in the ""the part which she had written for herself"": ""chatelaine to the largest [plantation], wife to the wealthiest, mother of the most fortunate"" (54), blithely encouraging the courtship and anticipating the marriage of her daughter with the apparently very eligible Charles Bon - until reality, in the form of the trouble between her husband and her son and the exactions of the Civil War, prostrate her. She is last seen in 1863 ""dying in bed in a darkened room"" where she had spent the last two years of her life (61, 62).</p>","Yes"

He is also the great-grandson and last living descendant of Thomas Sutpen, ""the scion, the heir, the apparent (though not obvious)"" (296).  He is described as ""hulking slack-mouthed saddle-colored"" (173) and again as ""a hulking young light-colored negro man in clean faded overalls and shirt, his arms dangling, no surprise, no nothing in the saddle-colored and slack-mouthed idiot face"" (296).  Both his parents were legally 'black,' according to the Jim Crow laws of the South, but Shreve says he ""had inherited what he was from his mother and only what he could never have been from his father"" (174).  Shreve also says, on the penultimate page of the novel, that ""the Jim Bonds are going to conquer the western hemisphere"" (302).</p>","Yes"

Since his daughter is described as ""Haiti-born"" (268), it seems likely that he himself is originally from France.  He is apparently a widower, since he tells Sutpen that his daughter's ""mother had been a Spanish woman"" (283).</p>","No"
"18938","100","Judith Sutpen","Sutpen, Judith","Thomas Sutpen, Ellen Coldfield Sutpen","<p>Sutpen's daughter Judith first appears in the prequel to <em>Absalom!</em>, the short story ""Wash""; though her character is barely sketched, her actions often anticipate her story in the novel.  As ""Miss Judith"" she lives alone in the big house on the Sutpen plantation during much of the Civil War, after the deaths of her mother and brother and while her father is away fighting (541).  After the war, she remains with her father, helping Wash Jones put him to bed when he gets drunk and helping Wash's fifteen-year-old granddaughter Milly sew a dress for the wedding that, although it never happens, would have made Milly her step-mother.  Her character comes into much clearer - and more poignant - focus in <em>Absalom!</em>, though as the daughter and sister in this novel about fathers and sons.  Mr. Compson describes her as ""the hoyden who could - and did - outrun and outclimb, and ride and fight both with and beside her brother"" (52).  Mr. Compson also refers to the  ""curious and unusual relationship"" between these siblings (79), calling them ""that single personality with two bodies"" (73), but on the whole the narrative emphasizes the differences in their character and their fates.  Stronger than her brother, Judith is nonetheless left at home while he rides away twice - first with her fiance and next after killing her fiance.  Her story is largely neglected and she herself largely silent.  In her one long speech, she talks to Quentin's grandmother about the human longing to leave ""something that would make a mark"" to outlast time in words that are not only eloquent but recognizably Faulknerian (101), but the written words she passes on preserve her dead fiance's voice and experience, not her own.  What the novel does show about Judith's life, however, testifies to her emotional and psychological strength: the girl who could stoically watch her father wrestling with his slaves becomes the woman who can keep up the failing plantation while her father is away at the war, who invites the woman she thinks was her fiance's mistress to visit the grave she made for him, and who, a ""unwived widow"" (110), adopts the orphan son of her murdered fiance and does the best she can to help him escape his vexed inheritance.  She cannot escape hers.  She dies of smallpox contracted while taking care that son inside her father's house.</p>","Yes"
"18937","99","Henry Sutpen","Sutpen, Henry","Thomas Sutpen, Ellen Coldfield Sutpen","<p>In two of the three texts in which this son of Thomas Sutpen is mentioned, he is not named and his story is relatively uncomplicated.  In ""Wash,"" the prequel to <em>Absalom!</em>,  he was ""killed in action"" during the Civil War (538).  In <em>The Unvanquished</em>, published soon after <em>Absalom!</em>, the narrator writes that Sutpen's ""son killed his daughter's fiance on the eve of the wedding and vanished"" (222).  In <em>Absalom!</em> itself, however, he is given the name Henry, and his action provides the narrative with the mystery that haunts it from beginning to end.  As the only son of the largest plantation owner in Yoknapatawpha, Henry is expected to inherit and perpetuate his father's  dynasty. Instead, on the eve of the Civil War he ""adjures his father and renounces his birthright and the roof under which he had been born"" (62). Mr. Compson describes him as both a ""humorless yokel"" (86) and a ""romantic"" (97), and refers more than once to Henry's ""curious relationship"" with his sister Judith (62, 79). At college he meets Charles Bon, for whose sake he renounces his patrimony and with whom he serves throughout the Civil War, before killing him at the gate to Sutpen's Hundred during the war's last days.  As a fratricide he is a kind of double-exile for decades, but despite his renunciation and his disappearance, in the end he cannot escape the legacy of his father's ""design,"" and the huge mansion his father had built is the roof under which he dies.</p>","Yes"
"18936","98","Clytemnestra","Clytemnestra","Thomas Sutpen, Unnamed Mother of Clytemnestra","<p>In <em>Absalom!</em> Clytemnestra (Clytie) is the daughter of Thomas Sutpen and one of the two enslaved women he brings with him to Yoknapatawpha.  She is first mentioned by Rosa, as the ""negro girl"" with a ""Sutpen face"" beside Judith Sutpen, Clytie's half-sister (22); later Rosa refers to her ""Sutpen coffee-colored face"" (109).  Sutpen ""named [Clytemnestra] himself,"" after a legendary Greek queen, though Mr. Compson ""likes to believe"" that Sutpen ""intended to name her Cassandra,"" after another figure from Greek tragedy (48).  Clytemnestra grows up enslaved, but alongside Sutpen's white children; she and Judith sleep ""in the same room, but with Judith in the bed and she on a pallet on the floor"" (112).  After slavery is abolished Clytemnestra remains in the house, where, after she travels alone to New Orleans to find Charles Bon's orphaned son, she and Judith try to raise him, and later, alone, she raises Bon's grandson.  She dies presiding over the final act of the fall of the house of Sutpen, an enigmatic presence to the end.  She could say, like Dilsey in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, that she has seen the first and the last, but Dilsey is a much more transparent character: Clytie's thoughts and motivations remain hidden.</p>","Yes"
"18935","97","Mrs. Charles Bon","Bon, Mrs. Charles","","<p>While almost nothing is certain in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, it is particularly difficult to know how to identify this character.  When she first appears in the narrative she is first called ""the other woman"" (other than Judith, that is) whose photograph Charles Bon is carrying when he is killed (71).  Mr. Compson calls her ""the octoroon mistress"" (75), Bon's ""eighth part negro mistress"" (80), and ""a hereditary negro concubine"" (168).  Shreve (who as a non-Southerner is unfamiliar with the caste term ""white trash,"" 147) refers to her as ""the octoroon"" (249, 286).  (According to the racial categories once in widespread use, an ""octoroon"" is someone with seven white and one black great-grandparents.)  Most of the published scholarship on the novel follows Mr. Compson and identifies this character as ""the octoroon mistress,"" but that is an interpretive, not to say racially loaded choice.  If she and Bon were married, she is his wife.  The novel repeatedly refers to a wedding ""ceremony,"" often qualifying that noun with the adjective ""morganatic"" (80) - usually meaning a marriage between spouses of different social ranks in which no claim can be made on the property or title of the more highly ranked spouse; in the novel, it apparently means a wedding between two different races, which would not have been a legal marriage in Louisiana or Mississippi.  But if both Bon and this woman are part 'black,' there's no legal barrier to the marriage, or to granting the woman the title Mrs. Bon, as our representation of her does.  Her character is just as problematic as her name.  Almost all references to her are attributable to Mr. Compson.  His description of her probably tells us more about him than about her, given the extent to which he relies on stereotypical associations of her 'blackness' with the trope of the tragic mulatto and the sexualized black body.  Mr. Compson has never seen her, but says she has ""a face like a tragic magnolia, the eternal female, the eternal Who-suffers"" (91); her ""white blood"" gives ""the shape and pigment to what the white man calls beauty,"" while her blackness links her to ""the hot equatorial groin of the world"" that pre-dates ""that white one of ours"" (92).  Mrs. Bon does come to Yoknapatawpha once, at Judith's invitation.  The description of her during her visit to Bon's grave is also provided by Mr. Compson, who calls her ""the magnolia-faced woman a little plumper now, a woman created by and for darkness"" (157).   Not even the photograph of her and their son that Bon carries is described in any detail.  Shreve says he substituted it for Judith's as a signal to the white woman that ""I was no good"" (287), another interpretive act.  Like the phrase ""octoroon mistress,"" however, that is by no means the only way to understand her or that photograph in the larger contexts - narrative or racial - of the story that the novel tells.</p>","Yes"

When Judith and Clytemnestra bring him from New Orleans to Sutpen's Hundred after his mother dies, Judith tells him to ""Call me Aunt Judith"" (169), perhaps without realizing that he is in fact her half-nephew and her father's grandson.  A ""thin delicate child with a smooth ivory sexless face"" (157) dressed in ""expensive Fauntleroy clothing"" (158), he grows up into a tortured adult who wears ""harsh and shapeless denim"" overalls, the ""burlesque uniform and regalia of the tragic burlesque of the sons of Ham"" (160), married to a ""coal black"" woman (166) and living as a tenant farmer on his grandfather's plantation ""in one of the dilapidated slave cabins which he rebuilt"" (167).  Mr. Compson says he lives in a ""Gethsemane which he had decreed and created for himself"" (169), but it would be more accurate to say he is crucified by the cross in his blood, as 'blood' was racially defined by the world into which he was born.

Faulkner's first account of him appears in ""Evangeline,"" a story he tried unsuccessfully to sell in mid-1931; there 'Charles Bon' is an orphan from New Orleans who marries Judith Sutpen and is killed by Judith's brother Henry at the end of the Civil War, apparently because Henry discovers he is already married to a woman with ""negro blood.""  The story contains no hint that he is either Thomas Sutpen's son or part Negro.  Why Henry kills Bon is the mystery that organizes <em>Absalom</em>.  It is apparently resolved when two of the novel's narrators, Quentin and Shreve, learn at the end that Bon himself is part Negro, although that fact is not known to anyone in Yoknapatawpha except Bon's father, his half-brother and Quentin Compson, and in the end it may not even be a 'fact' at all.  Such is the ambiguous nature of <em>Absalom!</em> as a story about the way people construct stories and histories.  Each of its narrators casts Bon in a different kind of narrative. To Mr. Compson, for whom Bon is ""the curious one"" (74), he is an ""indolent fatalist"" (83), ""miscast for the time and knowing it"" (78).  To Rosa, he is ""Charles Bon, Charles Good, Charles-Husband-soon-to-be"" (119), one of the Confederate heroes about whom she writes poetry.  Shreve and Quentin first cast him as an unloved and psychologically homeless child longing for his father's recognition, before Shreve ends up calling him a ""black son of a bitch"" (286).  The chronology that Faulkner provides as an appendix to the novel says that Bon's mother ""has negro blood"" (305), but the chronology contains unmistakable errors and is arguably unreliable.  Bon is referred to again, though not by name, in <em>The Unvanquished</em>; in that one mention - Sutpen's ""son killed his daughter's fiancé on the eve of the wedding and vanished"" (222) - the powerful questions that the character of ""Bon"" raises in <em>Absalom!</em> don't come up at all.  Ultimately Faulkner's readers have to answer the question ""who is Charles Bon?"" for themselves - or decide that, like the past itself, he is inescapable but unknowable.</p>

She is the ""Haiti-born"" daughter of a French sugar planter (268).  When she first appears in the narrative, it is as ""a shadow that almost emerged for a moment and then faded again"" (199) - the elusiveness of this is entirely appropriate.  Sutpen tells General Compson that her mother ""had been a Spaniard"" (203), but later tells his son Henry that in fact she was ""part negro"" (283), which is the reason why Sutpen felt he had to divorce her.  The novel does provide one detailed description of her, as an embittered old woman living in New Orleans: ""the slight dowdy woman with untidy gray-streaked raven hair coarse as a horse's tail, with parchment-colored skin and implacable pouched black eyes which alone showed no age because they showed no forgetting . . .""   This description seems entirely convincing, until the narrator adds ""whom Shreve and Quentin had invented . . .""   This seems conclusively to discredit the description, until the narrator adds ""and which was probably true enough"" (268).  Whether, as Sutpen believes, she was ""part negro,"" and thus, by the ideological terms of the South in which he seeks to establish a dynasty, it was ""impossible that this woman"" could ""be incorporated in my design"" (212); or whether, as Shreve and Quentin's reconstruction asserts, she in fact did raise her son to seek revenge on the man who ""cast you and me aside"" (238) - these are questions that remain unresolved in the text.</p>","No"

"18923","85","Thomas Sutpen","Sutpen, Thomas","Thomas Sutpen&#039;s Father, Thomas Sutpen&#039;s Mother","<p>As the central figure in one of Faulkner's greatest novels, <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, Thomas Sutpen is a very different character, depending on which of the novel's story-tellers is telling his story.  On the opening pages, for example, he is a dominant if demonic force that, according to Miss Rosa, is responsible for destroying the culture of the Old South.  When he gets to tell his own story, however, as transmitted through three generations of Compsons, he appears as a traumatized small boy who is himself determined if not destroyed by the culture of the Old South.  At the same time, Sutpen is also a character whom Faulkner himself revises several times across the course of the eight Yoknapatawpha fictions in which he appears.  Faulkner probably has no larger design for him in mind when, the the very first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, John Sartoris' sister refers elliptically to the ""better colonel"" who replaced her brother in command of the Confederate regiment from the county (238), but later the replacement colonel is Sutpen - though in ""Retreat"" (and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>) Buck McCaslin calls him ""a damn whippersnapper"" and an incompetent soldier (21).  In ""Wash,"" the first publication to give him a name, he is ""Colonel Sutpen"" - overbearing owner of a large plantation in Yoknapatawpha, a Confederate officer who earns a citation from Robert E. Lee, a man obsessed with producing a male heir after his son is killed in the War, and the father of a female child with a poor white teenager, Milly Jones, whose grandfather Wash kills him.  This short story gives no information about Sutpen's pre-Yoknapatawpha biography, nor any reason to question his aristocratic pedigree.  The same events recur in <em>Absalom!</em>, but there the narrative ultimately exposes his very humble beginnings and reveals his determination to build a dynasty - his ""design"" - as his attempt to revenge himself upon the plantation aristocracy that denied his humanity. His design fails - tragically, or ironically, or perhaps even justly. But it also becomes the means for Faulkner to take one of his hardest looks at the Southern past and the legacy it has left. Quentin Compson raises the novel's implicit question when he wonders if it took ""Thomas Sutpen to make all of us"" (210).  But even as he was writing <em>Absalom!</em>, Faulkner was working on the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories, and in them he imaginatively returns to John Sartoris as the epitome of the Old South.  Late in that novel, in a conversation with Drusilla comparing the two colonels, Bayard essentially reduces Sutpen to an ""underbred"" and ""a cold ruthless man"" (222).  Sutpen's name is mentioned in four additional fictions, but mainly in a still more reduced role as the landowner who sold Major de Spain the camp in the wilderness where Faulkner sets his hunting stories.  While Quentin remains haunted by Sutpen's ghost at the end of <em>Absalom!</em>, Faulkner's later fictions seem to seek to exorcize him.</p>","No"

Her husband calls her ""a fine wearying woman,"" and it is suggested that she made him move from coastal Virginia to the mountains (180).

The novel does not mention anything else about her, but what it says later about the second wife - Buddy's mother, from whom he gets his coloring - suggests this wife was the mother of Virginius' five other sons: unlike Buddy, for instance, they all have ""brown eyes and black hair"" (354).  In ""The Tall Men"" Anse McCallum (Faulkner's new names for Virginius) has only been married once, so we assume the Mrs. Anse McCallum who is buried beside her husband in the family graveyard in that short story is this 'first wive' from <em>Flags</em>.</p>","Yes"

He is only mentioned in <em>As I Lay Dying</em> as the twin brother of the MacCallum (Stuart) whose first name Samson can't remember (119).  In ""The Tall Men"" he remains largely silent, but when he shakes hands with the outsider in the room where his brother Buddy lies seriously injured, the hand he offers is ""hard enough, but the grasp quite limp, quite cold"" (47).  In ""Knight's Gambit"" the fact that he ""had bred and raised and trained and sold horses all his life"" and ""knew more about horses probably than any man in the country"" becomes relevant when he unknowingly sells a weapon - a very dangerous horse - to a potential murderer (176), an episode that is recalled in <em>The Mansion</em>, the last text in which he figures.

Much to his father's disgust, he is attempting to transform hunting by interbreeding a fox and a hound.  In ""The Tall Men"" his brothers seek his counsel as the eldest, the one who ""knowed father longer than the rest of us"" and would best know how Old Anse would have acted (57), but he is not portrayed as the most dominant personality in the family: when Dr. Schofield asks Jackson for his opinion about whether to operate on brother Buddy with only whiskey for anesthesia, it is brother Stuart who answers instead.</p>","Yes"

In view of that absence, the descriptions of his character in the novel in which he does appear are significant.  He is ""squat"" and ""slightly tubby,"" with ""something domestic, womanish"" about him (335). Unlike his brothers, he spends ""most of the time"" inside: he superintends the kitchen, is ""a better cook"" than the black woman who is the family's official cook, and is locally famous for the quality of his homemade whiskey (335). Given his brothers' names - Lee, Jackson, Stuart and Raphael Semmes all pay homage to prominent Confederate military heroes - it's possible that Henry is named after Henry Clay, the antebellum Kentucky Senator.  Based on the quality of Henry's moonshine in <em>Flags</em>, we assume that Ratliff's reference to ""some of McCallum's best"" when he offers a bottle to Ab Snopes in <em>The Hamlet</em> is Faulkner's only other mention of him (54).

He returns to Yoknapatawpha, resumes his place in the yeoman family (though he doesn't display the medal, in deference to his un-reconstructed ex-Confederate father who refuses to believe his son fought in a ""Yankee"" army, 342), and continues his life as a countryman and avid hunter.  The only one of the father's sons not named after a Confederate hero (Buddy's given name is Virginius too), Buddy is the MacCallum whom his brothers are counting on to marry someday and perpetuate the family name. That name changes in the fictions Faulkner wrote after 1940, when he revised 'MacCallum' into 'McCallum,' but Buddy <em>does</em> marry, appearing with his twin sons in ""The Tall Men"" and a son in <em>The Town</em>.

At the start of the Civil War he walked from Mississippi to Virginia to enlist (because his mother came from Virginia) and served til the surrender at Appomattox.  After the war he walked home, married, and (as a character puts it in ""The Tall Men"") ""started getting them boys"" (54) - his six (or five) sons, who continue to live in the house he built in the northeastern corner of Yoknapatawpha.  He appears as a very 'unreconstructed' Confederate in <em>Flags</em>, he is referred to in <em>The Hamlet</em> as one of the men who bought a Texas pony at the auction in Frenchman's Bend, and he's been dead for about fifteen years before ""The Tall Men"" takes place.

In the account of the Compsons and the Gibsons that Faulkner wrote 16 years after <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> was published - familiarly known as ""Appendix Compson"" - Faulkner says that Frony ""married a pullman porter and went to St Louis to live"" (343).  Faulkner may be thinking of these two men as one character, but the novel's reference to Jefferson rather than Memphis as his ""home"" suggests otherwise.

It's also possible that this character is the man whom Dilsey refers to as Luster's ""pappy"" in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (59), though there's not enough textual evidence to establish that connection.

While he clearly resents the demands of that job, and can be intentionally and inadvertently cruel to the helpless Benjy, he performs the task as well as he can.   That much is clear.  There are, however, several unanswerable questions associated with his character.  The novel gives no indication who his father is, or what, if Frony is married, Luster's last name is.  And Luster's next appearance, as the servant who accompanies Mr. Compson and Quentin on a hunting excursion in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, is a chronological impossibility, since in the earlier novel Luster wasn't born until after Quentin committed suicide.  (While treating time a-chronologically might be consistent with the ambiguities of <em>Absalom</em>, it would be much too ingenious to suggest that Faulkner deliberately introduces Luster into an impossible past; instead, he probably confused Luster with one of his uncles, Versh or T.P., both of whom had earlier taken care of Benjy and either one of whom might have been there in <em>Absalom!</em>)  In his final appearance in the fictions Luster remains in the time and place and role that defined him in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>.  He has his own entry in ""Appendix Compson,"" and it pays him a compliment:  ""A man, aged 14.  Who was not only capable of the complete care and security of an idiot twice his age and three times his size, but could keep him entertained"" (343).  But despite the 1940s setting of the ""Appendix,"" Luster's life as ""a man"" in his 20s and probably living with his mother and family in Memphis remains unacknowledged.</p>","Yes"

In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> she appears in Benjy's memories as a child about the same age as Quentin and Caddy Compson, and in the last section as an adult who still lives close enough to Dilsey to walk to church with her mother on Easter Sunday.  She is also Luster's mother, though the novel does not indicate if she has a husband or if, like Caddy's daughter, Luster was conceived out of wedlock.  As a person (and unlike Quentin and Caddy) she seems realistic, even stoical, about life: when in Benjy's section Caddy says that ""white folks dont have funerals,"" she replies ""Your grandmammy dead as any nigger can get, I reckon"" (33); when in the last section Dilsey asks her what she'll do if it rains on her new dress, she replies, ""Git wet, I reckon"" (290).  She is only mentioned in ""That Evening Sun,"" but appears again in the ""Appendix Compson"" that Faulkner wrote 16 years after the novel.

P. calls it (37) - that has been bought for Caddy's wedding.  In 1928 he no longer lives on the Compson property, but still drives the carriage for Mrs. Compson's Sunday afternoon trips to the cemetery.  His absence from the place on the afternoon of Easter Sunday makes the novel's brilliant ending possible; this is one of the most impressive uses of ""absence"" in the canon.  T.P. is briefly mentioned in ""That Evening Sun.""  In the ""Appendix Compson"" that Faulkner wrote in the mid-1940s,  ""TP"" (the name is written without any punctuation) has, like the rest of his family, left Compsons and Yoknapatawpha for a new and possibly freer existence, wearing ""fine bright cheap intransigent clothes"" ""on Memphis's Beale Street"" (343).</p>","Yes"

He is mentioned again, briefly, in ""That Evening Sun,"" but otherwise does not appear again in the fictions - not even in ""Appendix Compson,"" where his mother, sister, brother and nephew are described living in Memphis in the early 1940s.</p>","Yes"
"18899","62","Roskus Gibson","Gibson, Roskus","","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Roskus is husband to Dilsey and father to Versh, T.P., and Frony. He drives for the Compsons while also caring for the farm animals, although over the years his rheumatism makes that increasingly hard.  He is slightly less loyal than his wife to the white family he works for, complaining that there ""aint no luck on this place"" (29). Dilsey reproaches him for giving their son Versh ""them Memphis notions"" - that is, presumably, encouraging Versh to leave Yoknapatawpha (31).  Roskus' death is recorded among the jumbled memories that recur in Benjy's consciousness, but the date of it is uncertain.  Benjy remembers when ""Dilsey moaned"" in her grief and Luster said he saw Roskus' ghost, ""waving his arms in the barn"" (33).  His only other appearance in the fictions is at the start of ""A Justice,"" when he is briefly described driving the surrey that carries Grandfather, Quentin, Caddy and Jason to the Compson family farm.</p>","Yes"
"18898","61","Dilsey Gibson","Gibson, Dilsey","","<p>Dilsey is the matriarch of the Gibson family and the source of whatever emotional stability there is in the Compson family.  A major character in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, she is married to Roskus, the mother of Versh, Frony, and T.P., and the grandmother of Luster.  She is a devout Christian, a loyal servant and a very caring human being. As a character she is both related to the ""mammy"" stereotype and one of Faulkner's most dignified and impressive creations.  Although she is offstage for most of ""That Evening Sun,"" ""sick"" with an illness that is not described (290), when she does appear in that story she shows the same nurturing generosity toward another black woman, Nancy, as she shows toward the Compson children in the novel.  She no longer lives in a cabin on the Compson property or works for the white family in ""Appendix Compson""; instead, she lives with her daughter in ""the Negro residence section of Memphis"" (336).  In that text Faulkner gives her and her family their own brief sections at the end: ""These others were not Compsons.  They were black"" (343).  Dilsey's personal entry is a kind of epitaph: ""They endured"" (343).  It is in part a testament to her extraordinary strength of character, and at the same time a reminder that, as an artist, Faulkner depicts Dilsey (and her family) as foils, in terms of the story of the Compson family - which does not endure.</p>","Yes"
"18897","60","Mother of Quentin MacLachan Compson","Compson, Mother of Quentin MacLachan","","<p>In the ""Appendix"" to <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> that Faulkner published in 1946, the mother of Quentin MacLachan Compson I apparently dies early in his life.  He is an ""orphan"" who is raised by her family in ""the Perth highlands"" (326).</p>","No"
"18896","59","Father of Quentin MacLachan Compson","Compson, Father of Quentin MacLachan","","<p>In the ""Appendix"" to <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> that Faulkner published in 1946, the family line begins with this man: a printer in Glasgow, Scotland, who is the father of Quentin MacLachan Compson.

"18895","58","Damuddy Bascomb","Bascomb, Damuddy","","<p>The grandmother whom the Compson children call ""Damuddy"" in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> does not appear elsewhere in the fictions.  The day of her death, in the summer of 1898, is the earliest scene in Benjy and Quentin's memories.  The novel does not explicitly say that she is their maternal grandmother, but Mrs. Compson's reaction to her death and Damuddy's association with Jason - until Damuddy got ""sick,"" for example, Jason apparently slept in her bed with her (26) - suggest she is a Bascomb rather than a Compson.  This identification seems borne out by the Compson grandmother who appears in the later <em>Unvanquished</em> stories.</p>","Yes"
"18894","57","Mrs. Quentin Compson II","Compson, Mrs. Quentin II","","<p>The ""Mrs. Compson"" who appears in ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" as both a short story and a chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em> is a hard character to identify.  Throughout the other four <em>Unvanquished</em> stories that mention ""Mrs. Compson"" it seems clear that she is married to General (Quentin) Compson, who is off fighting the Civil War until the final story, ""Odor of Verbena,"" when he makes a brief appearance (245). But in ""Skirmish at Sartoris,"" readers are told that the ""only husband [Mrs. Compson] had ever had had been locked up for crazy a long time ago"" (193), and that cannot be the general. Faulkner may just have completely forgotten about General Compson when he wrote that, but we have decided to assume that this husband is the general's father, Quentin Compson II. However, the confusion Faulkner creates here cannot resolved. The only way to provide this institutionalized ""husband"" with a wife is to add a second ""Mrs. Compson"" to the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories, which is what we are doing - but it has to be added that the ""Mrs. Compson"" here (who brings Aunt Louisa's letter out to John Sartoris) seems exactly like the ""Mrs. Compson"" in those other four stories and chapters.</p>","Yes"
"18893","56","Mrs. Jason Compson II","Compson, Mrs. Jason II","","<p>The wife of General Compson first appears in the mid-1930s in at least four of the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories and the novel <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>  In the stories she appears mainly in the pieces of a lady's equipment that she lends Rosa Millard on two occasions: a hat, a shawl and a parasol. But she appears in person at Rosa's funeral, where as a lady herself she wants a prominent minister to officiate and as a compassionate human being she invites Bayard and Ringo, a white boy and a black one, to ""come home and live with her"" until Bayard's father returns from the war (98) - both offers are rejected.  Her own husband, General Compson, is also off at the war.  (Half a dozen years later she is represented in Faulkner's reprise of the <em>Unvanquished</em> tales, ""My Grandmother Millard,"" by the strategic way she deployed the sacred status of a 'lady' to successfully keep the Compson silver away from the Yankees.)  In the novel <em>Absalom!</em> she appears in three different roles.  At the time of her marriage she is ""a stranger in Jefferson"" who is left ""in hysterics"" after a visit from Rosa's aunt; in a comic variation on the theme of the continuing presence of the past, ""even twenty years after that day"" she refuses to discuss what happened (42). She is mentioned again as the source from whom her son learns about the way the slaves at Sutpen's mock Wash Jones during the Civil War (225) - perhaps because as a woman she remains in Yoknapatawpha after most of the local white men are, like her husband, away at the war. And because Judith Sutpen gives her the letter that Charles Bon wrote near the end of the war, this Mrs. Compson is the source of the one authenticated document from the story that is being reconstructed in the novel as a whole: from her hands through her son's that letter is passed on to Quentin and to us.  Her last mention is in <em>The Town</em>, where in an intriguing variation on the theme of lending her hat to Rosa Millard, she is identified as the ""old Mrs. Compson"" who gave Old Het - an impoverished Negro - the ""purple toque"" that she has worn for ""fifty years"" (242). (She certainly may also be the ""Mrs. Compson"" who appears in another pre-<em>Absalom!</em> <em>Unvanquished</em> story, ""Skirmish at Sartoris."" We decided she isn't, but there's plenty of leeway for questioning our decision; see the entry on ""Mrs. Quentin Compson II"" for more information.)</p>","Yes"
"18892","55","Caroline Bascomb Compson","Compson, Caroline Bascomb","Damuddy Bascomb","<p>In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Caroline Compson is the sister of Maury Bascomb (Uncle Maury), the wife of Jason Compson III, and the mother of Quentin, Candace, Jason and Maury|Benjamin. She is probably also the daughter of the woman called ""Damuddy"" whose death is the earliest event (and loss) in Benjy and Quentin's memories.  A bed-ridden neurotic and a hypochondriac, Caroline seems hopelessly preoccupied with herself.  She is obsessed with the social standing of the Bascomb family and largely oblivious to the misery of her own. She often speaks of how badly her children have let her down, but readers are likely to be appalled by how badly she fails them. The only child she recognizes as truly hers is Jason; she is ashamed of Benjy, and hostile towards Caddy and Quentin. Given how consistently she is portrayed as an uncaring and incompetent mother, it is easy to appreciate the depth of feeling in Quentin's (repeated) phrase, ""if I'd just had a mother so I could say Mother Mother"" (172, also 95).  It's like the golfers' ""caddie"" that Benjy keeps believing means ""Caddy"" is close by: for Caroline's children the word ""mother"" is basically just an empty sound, a name for what isn't there.  She appears next in ""That Evening Sun,"" which is narrated by Quentin.  He never describes ""Mother,"" as he calls her, but her spoken words characterize her as the querulous, self-centered person readers meet in novel: ""You'll leave me alone, to take Nancy home?"" she complains to her husband (293).  According to the ""Appendix Compson"" she dies in 1933.  The last two volumes of the Snopes trilogy mention her briefly.  Given her fastidiousness about her public image, it probably gave Faulkner pleasure in <em>The Town</em> to make her the owner of the building that Montgomery Ward Snopes rents for his Atelier Monty, a fancy name for a business that gave the men in and around Yoknapatawpha access to pornographic French postcards.  In her last mention she and Faulkner create a new ending to the Compson story.  Although in the ""Appendix"" Jason ships Benjy to the state mental institution after her death, in <em>The Mansion</em> we learn that not only is she still alive when Jason does that, but once it's done her ""whining"" and tears force him to bring Benjy back home.  Readers of those earlier texts are familiar with her whining, but her maternal grief here may come as a surprise.</p>","Yes"
"18891","54","(Miss) Quentin","Quentin, (Miss)","Candace Compson","<p>It's not easy to know what to call Yoknapatawpha's one female ""Quentin"" - of two in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and of four altogether on the Compson family tree.  She's the daughter of Caddy, but even Caddy seems not to know who her father might be (many readers and even quite a few scholars assume it's Dalton Ames, the man who took Caddy's virginity in that novel, but Caddy tells the other Quentin in the novel that before she married she had ""too many"" lovers, 115).  Caddy named her Quentin in honor of her brother, who committed suicide before his niece was born. The ""Appendix Compson"" that Faulkner wrote sixteen years later titles her genealogical entry ""QUENTIN"" (341; her uncle's entry is ""QUENTIN III,"" 331).  It also calls her ""The last.  Fatherless nine months before her birth, nameless at birth and already doomed to be unwed from the instant the dividing egg determined its sex"" (341).  Our decision to call her ""Miss Quentin"" might seem too Victorian, given all the 'improprieties' in her behavior, especially her sexual promiscuity.  There is reason to think that she is already pregnant before the novel begins: the money she is desperately expecting her mother to send was probably supposed to pay for an abortion.  However, her uncle Jason steals that - along with $3000 that Caddy has sent over the years.  Between his cruelty and the lovelessness of her grandmother, Quentin grows up without a chance, though also without any of the generosity of spirit that makes her mother such an appealing character.  Miss Quentin isn't doomed only to be unwed.  On the night before Easter she runs away from a place that has never been a home with a man she has just met.  Like her promiscuity and pregnancy, her running away repeats the grim pattern of her mother's life, but the narrator of the ""Appendix"" measures the distance between the tragedy of Caddy's fate and the emptiness of Miss Quentin's when he ends her section by insisting that ""whatever occupation overtook her"" would not appear in the glamorous forms that her mother's has taken (342).</p>","Yes"
"18890","53","Benjamin Compson","Compson, Benjamin","Jason Compson III, Caroline Bascomb Compson","<p>Benjy Compson is one of the most original characters in American literature.  To Mrs. Compson, who originally named him Maury in honor of her brother, Benjy's severe mental handicap is shameful, and a reason to change his name to Benjamin - apparently on her son Quentin's suggestion, though tellingly he gets the Biblical significance of the name Benjamin wrong.  To Faulkner, Benjy's mind is a brilliant way to begin his high Modernist novel <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> by dropping his readers into a world where the past is always present, a world that has lost just about everything, including that Bible, that once gave life meaning, a world where reality is the sound and the fury that signifies nothing.  Benjy's 'reality' is defined by his incomprehension and his memories from a childhood that is gone, especially his memories of his sister Caddy.  His section ends as he remembers the moment thirty years earlier when Caddy promised their father that she will ""take good care of Maury"" (75).  But Caddy - like that name - is gone, and Benjy spends his thirty-third birthday (as presumably he spends every day since she left) trying in vain to find her again.  The golfers on the land that once was his beloved ""pasture"" keep calling ""Here, caddie"" (3), but even the sounds of words are empty tokens of what is absent.  Although it takes readers some time to orient themselves inside Benjy's 'reality,' once they do it is impossible not to be deeply moved by his embodiment of the metaphysics of absence, ""trying"" and failing ""to say"" what he has lost (53).  Given how much he means to that novel's project, it's not surprising that Faulkner doesn't even mention him in the other early stories with his three siblings in them (""A Justice,"" ""That Evening Sun"").  As BENJAMIN he has an entry in the ""Appendix Compson"" that Faulkner wrote 16 years later, which is somewhat surprising in its business-like rehearsal of the sad outlines of his home life, especially the way it seems to agree with his brother Jason about why the adolescent Benjy accosted that school girl (<em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, 52-53; ""Appendix,"" 339).  Still more surprising is the new ending to the story that Faulkner adds three decades later.   In  <em>The Mansion</em> Benjy's mother - apparently in a very rare fit of maternal concern - makes Jason bring his brother home from the state mental institution in Jackson; ""less than two years"" later Benjy starts a fire that destroys both himself and the Compson house.</p>","Yes"
"18889","52","Jason Compson IV","Compson, Jason IV","Jason Compson III, Caroline Bascomb Compson","<p>In ""Appendix Compson"" Faulkner calls Jason the one ""sane"" male Compson (338).  Readers of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, aware of his extraordinary mental cruelty to his siblings and his niece, not to mention his bigotries and venalities, are likely to use an even harsher term.  But if we set his story in the context of the past that matters most in this novel, the Freudian landscape of compulsions and projections, it seems more accurate to say that Jason is as much the victim of his childhood as any of those siblings.  Nearly everything he does during his section repeats the script that was laid down for him by that childhood, from following his niece around in the same way his mother had made him follow his sister years earlier, to locking up the money he embezzles from his niece and counting it every day at least once as a subsitute for the job he'd 'lost' years earlier in Herbert Head's bank, though he never had that job to begin with.  Jason' day as a thirty-five-year-old adult begins with him in his mother's bedroom, and though he gets as far from home during that day as Ab Russell's farm half a dozen miles from Jefferson, he never breaks free from his mother's field of gravity.  He sees his role as trying ""to protect my own Mother"" and ""holding on to what little we have left"" (206), though what he's trying to protect either never existed to begin with, or is already gone.  Or is going - the irony of Jason's story is that for him Easter morning means the box in which he'd hoarded that money is 'empty.' This recalls the New Testament and the empty tomb, with all the difference in a world where only Dilsey and her fellow congregants can find redemption.  Jason spends Easter ""passing churches"" ""from time to time,"" ""carrying ancient wounds"" to a battle he's already lost, chasing after the purely material money that was supposed to give his life a larger significance (306).  Through it all, however, Jason's meanness of spirit equips him for modernity in a way that his siblings aren't, and although he never gets away from Jefferson, in the later fictions he does find a purely material place in it, selling the Compson estate and setting himself up as a cotton broker.  As the ""Appendix"" notes, he even ""competes and holds his own with the Snopeses who took over the little town"" (338).  Or almost.  <em>The Mansion</em> makes him out to be as underhanded as Flem, but when he tries to outmaneuver Flem in a real estate deal he ends up losing again.</p>","Yes"
"18888","51","Candace Compson","Compson, Candace","Jason Compson III, Caroline Bascomb Compson","<p>Speaking outside the pages of his art, Faulkner called Caddy Compson his ""heart's darling,"" and <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> his attempt to draw her ""picture.""  It's a very modern portrait, however, defined by her absence everywhere in the novel except in the minds of her three brothers, each of whom attempts to fill the absences at the center of his own life with what he tries to make her represent or (to use the term that is both there and absent in the novel's Shakespearean title) to 'signify.'  On her own terms, Caddy almost too good to be believable.  During their childhoods she always knows what Benjy is ""trying to say"" (53).  She loves Quentin despite his self-hatred, and as Quentin's long memory of the evening after she loses her virginity makes clear, she would die to save him (149-64).  In the midst of her own anguish as an outcast at her father's funeral she sincerely tells Jason she is ""sorry"" about ""that job"" (202) - the one her ex-husband had merely promised Jason.  Her first spoken words in the novel express her sympathy for the pigs at Christmas, ""because one of them got killed today"" (4).  Her marriage to Herbert Head, whom her mother calls ""my Harvard boy"" (93), can be seen as her last attempt to win her mother's love.  Mrs. Compson dons black to mourn the daughter who she sees kissing a boy and who is henceforth dead to her, and there's no question how destructive Caddy's promiscuity is for her brothers, who each in his own way needs her to remain unchanged.  But her sexuality seems to be her attempt to live - though as she tells Quentin about her lovers, ""when they touched me I died"" (149).  As a girl with muddy drawers she climbs that symbolic tree looking for the ""party,"" but Faulkner arranges his ironies so that what she sees instead is a ""funeral"" (36).  He sums this up in the ""Appendix Compson"" he wrote sixteen years later, where her entry begins ""Doomed and knew it"" (332).  The picture of Caddy displayed in that text is an uncaptioned photograph in a news magazine, of a ""cold serene and damned"" woman in an expensive car beside a ""German staffgeneral"" (334).  Associating the granddaughter of a Confederate general with a Nazi officer during World War II may be Faulkner's way of linking the antebellum South to another racist aristocracy that will not win the war it started.  It is certainly an extreme way to establish how lost she is.  In the two early short stories that Quentin narrates, she is a young girl, though both appearances show hints of her sexuality - as you would expect from Quentin. She is mentioned one last time, briefly, in <em>The Mansion</em>: ""she disappeared,"" the narrator says; ""nobody knew where"" (354).</p>","Yes"
"18887","50","Quentin Compson III","Compson, Quentin III","Jason Compson III, Caroline Bascomb Compson","<p>Quentin Compson is a major character in two of Faulkner's greatest novels, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> and <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, and the narrator of four early short stories.  He is also the oldest son in one of the most prominent Yoknapatawpha families but born after the South's defeat in the Civil War and at the end of the 19th century, and so has to try to grow up in a modern world that that has no place for him.  At the beginning of his section in the first novel he wakes up in his Harvard dorm room remembering his father handing him his grandfather's watch, symbol of what ""Compson"" and tradition are supposed to mean.  That watch is still in his pocket at the end of his section, still ticking though he's pulled the hands off it, as he leaves that room to commit suicide - because death is the only way he can escape time as an ongoing series of wounds and losses.  The past that haunts him in that novel is personal, the list of his failures - as the son of a mother who is incapable of loving him, a father who tells him that nothing means anything but a Compson must nonetheless be a gentleman, and especially as the oldest brother who cannot protect his sister - that constantly replays in his mind as he wanders in exile through the streets of a northern city.  In <em>Absalom!</em> the past that haunts him is cultural: the legacy of an Old South, as manifest in the character of Thomas Sutpen, that can neither be recovered nor escaped.  <em>Absalom!</em> takes place in the interval between Quentin leaving Yoknapatawpha for college in 1909 and killing himself in 1910.  Since in the larger canon his future is already in the past when Faulkner makes him the vehicle by which to ""tell about the South,"" as his roommate puts it (142), any hope that knowing the sins of the fathers might provide a way to move forward beyond them is stillborn from the start.  Quentin's larger story takes the futility of Horace Benbow's character (in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>) to what Quentin himself beautifully and terribly calls ""an unvarying nil: stalemate of dust and desire"" (124).  And yet it's easy to understand why Faulkner himself did not easily give up on Quentin's character, even though chronologically the short stories he narrates are incompatible with his biography in the novels.  In them he resurrects Quentin as an imaginative resource, a way to explore the parts of 'Yoknapatawpha' that lie outside the bounds of the aristocracy.  In ""That Evening Sun"" it's the experience of a black woman.  In ""A Justice,"" it's the experience of slavery and race as expressed by a biracial Indian, a member of the culture that was dispossessed decades before the plantation South lost the War.  In ""A Bear Hunt"" and ""Lion"" Quentin even allows Faulkner's imagination to take its first steps into the big woods, a world that (like death in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>) seems to lie outside time itself.  As his career goes on, Faulkner will go further in each of these directions, though without Quentin.  The two later texts that mention him (""Appendix Compson"" and <em>The Mansion</em>) briefly repeat his story but don't develop it.</p>","Yes"
"18886","49","Jason Compson III","Compson, Jason III","Jason Lycurgus Compson II, Mrs. Jason Compson II","<p>The third Compson named Jason and the father of Quentin, Caddy, Jason and Benjy was born around the time the South was defeated in the Civil War and as a result, his story suggests, grew up to become what Faulkner's ""Appendix Compson"" calls a ""cultured dipsomaniac"" (335).  His story, however, is never directly told.  Instead, his character is defined chiefly by his role in the life and death of his oldest son, Quentin.  ""Father said"" is a phrase that sounds again and again from the first to the penultimate page of Quentin's section in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>  (76, 178).  What Father says are variations on the idea that all human desires, including the longing for any kind of meaning, can be reduced to the ""reducto absurdum of all human experience"" (76) - but, as he reminds his son on that penultimate page, a Compson must go through the motions of being a gentleman: ""no compson has ever disappointed a lady"" (178).  Behind his nihilism is actually a set of humane impulses, and we are meant to understand that he is actually trying to give his son good advice; as the ""Appendix"" notes, he ""sold the last of his patrimony not to buy drink but to give one of his descendants at least the best chance in life he could think of"" - a Harvard education, or at least the prestige associated with the sound ""Harvard"" (335).  But Quentin's decision to kill himself before finishing even his freshman year can be understood as both the only way he can think of to drown out his father's internalized voice and his ultimate determination to prove his father wrong.  Mr. Compson's voice also plays a major role in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, not just in the three chapters where he and his son sit on the veranda of the Compson house talking about Thomas Sutpen and the Southern past but also in the chapters set in Quentin's Harvard dorm room.  In that setting, hundreds of miles away from Mississippi, both Quentin and his roommate Shreve note how each of them sounds ""just like Father"" (147, 210).  Mr. Compson's reconstructions of the Sutpen story are inflected with his skepticism, but there may be a detectable note of envy and nostalgia for the lost South in the way he sexualizes the life of his 'Charles Bon,' the young aristocrat who knows the ""secret and curious and unimaginable delights"" that can be purchased in the slave market in New Orleans (89).  While many commentators on <em>Absalom!</em> give more credence to Mr. Compson's narrative than to the other narrators' accounts, it's hard to see any objective reason for locating his perspective outside his own frustrations and desires.  He is not named in three of the other four texts that mention him, though again as ""Father"" his humane instincts are perceptible in ""That Evening Sun,"" where despite his wife's scolding he tries (while staying within the boundaries of race and class and his own indolence) to help Nancy, the black servant who is afraid for her life.  The other two short stories depict him in the context of Major de Spain's annual hunt for the bear; in ""Lion"" what 'Father says' about good hunting practices actually is good advice.</p>","Yes"
"18885","48","Jason Lycurgus Compson II","Compson, Jason Lycurgus II","Quentin Compson II, Mrs. Quentin Compson II","<p>General Jason Compson, the grandfather of Quentin, Caddy, Jason and Benjy, appears in thirteen different texts, the most of any Compson.  Given Faulkner's willingness to sacrifice consistency to the needs of a particular story, it's not surprising that it's hard to pull all his appearances into one cumulative biography. He is seen through Quentin's eyes in the first two of those texts, with ""Colonel Sartoris"" beside him as an avatar of an idealized Southern past in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (""and Grandfather was always right,"" 176), and as the plantation aristocrat in ""A Justice"" (""we all believed that he did fine things, that his waking life passed from one fine (if faintly grandiose) picture to another,"" 360).  <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> develops his own story in more detail - early settler in Yoknapatawpha, big planter, Confederate officer who lost an arm at the battle of Shiloh - but his role in that text is mainly defined by the fact that he was Thomas Sutpen's ""only friend"" (220); he is essentially the novel's fifth narrator, so much of the Sutpen story derives from what ""Grandfather"" told Mr. Compson that Sutpen told him, as retold in turn to Quentin by Mr. Compson.  He doesn't earn an entry of his own in either the ""Genealogy"" that <em>Absalom!</em> includes (307-09) or the ""Appendix Compson"" that Faulkner wrote in the mid-1940s, though the entry there for the first Jason Lycurgus Compson provides enough detail about him to dramatically revise the image Quentin had, calling Jason II the man who began the tradition of Compson men who ""fail at everything [they touch] save longevity or suicide"" (330).  But he acquires yet another identity (and apparently a new arm!) in the hunting stories Faulkner wrote.  As a member of Major de Spain's hunting parties he is an impressive figure.  While in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin sees grandfather's watch as yet one more symbolic reminder of failure, in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> the exemplary Ike McCaslin, who renounces his own grandfather's legacy, cherishes among his very few possessions the hunting horn, ""bound with silver,"" that ""General Compson left him left him in his will"" (345).  The General does succeed at longevity - he dies in 1900 - and last appears in Faulkner's last novel.  There the motif of failure creeps back into his biography: as an old man he keeps ""getting lost"" in the woods, a problem that grows worse when ""his hearing begins to fail"" (20).</p>","Yes"
"18884","47","Quentin Compson II","Compson, Quentin MacLachan II","Jason Compson I","<p>There are a few references to Quentin's great-grandfather in the early fictions about the family.  In <em>The Sound and The Fury</em> Mr. Compson mentions him when he gives Quentin his grandfather's watch (76).  In ""A Justice"" Sam Fathers tells Quentin the ""your great-grandpappy"" bought him and his mother as slaves (344).  In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> Quentin himself thinks about the ""one of our forefathers [who] was a governor"" (101), and when Faulkner added ""Appendix Compson"" to that novel sixteen years later he gave Quentin's great-grandfather <em>his</em> grandfather's name (Quentin MacLachan Compson, 329) and explicitly identified this Quentin II as the ""brilliant and gallant governor"" (335) on the family tree.  That part of his biography seems to hang together, but other aspects of it conflict with the story of the Compson family as Faulkner tells it elsewhere, and yet other aspects remain conjectural.  Faulkner's late novel <em>The Mansion</em>, for example, says explicitly that it is Quentin II who is the first Compson in Yoknapatawpha, that he arrives there in 1821, and acquires the land that became the Compson plantation from Mahataha (mother of Ikkemotubbe); this flatly contradicts what Faulkner says in the ""Appendix,"" where it is Quentin II's father Jason who first arrives in 1811 and acquires the land from Ikkemotubbe.  And while our database does identify Quentin II as 'first Compson in Yoknapatawpha' in ""A Name for the City,"" when Faulkner interpolated that story into <em>Requiem for a Nun</em> he explicitly says its Quentin II's father who is 'first Compson.'  These inconsistencies cannot be reconciled.  Nor can we say with any certainty who is the ""Compson"" mentioned in ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" (and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>): the husband of ""Mrs. Compson"" who was ""locked up for crazy a long time ago"" (62, 193).  Elsewhere in the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories ""Mrs. Compson"" is married to General (Lycurgus) Compson, who is fighting for the Confederacy; the only possible Compson who could have been ""locked up for crazy"" at the time is Quentin II - no matter how hard it is to see the man who shoots potatoes off the heads of enslaved children as the same man as the ""brilliant and gallant governor.""  The several narrators of <em>Absalom!</em> cannot agree on who 'Thomas Sutpen' was in that one text.  Who ""Quentin MacLachan Compson"" was across the seven texts in which he appears or (mainly) is mentioned, or which account of him is most reliable - those are equally if not more unanswerable questions.</p>","Yes"
"18883","46","Jason Compson I","Compson, Jason Lycurgus I","Charles Stuart Compson","<p><em>Requiem for a Nun</em> identifies the first member of the family in Yoknapatawpha as ""a man named Compson"" (11) - but which Compson?  Faulkner's fictions answer that question three different ways; there is no way to reconcile them, but this Compson is probably the one with the best claim.  In the prose introduction to Act I of <em>Requiem</em>, which actually takes place in the earliest days of the frontier settlement that will become Jefferson, the ""Compson"" who takes charge of a tense situation is not given <em>any</em> first name.  The prose part of Act III names him Jason (169), and develops his story in a bit more detail: he trades a race horse to Ikkemotubbe ""for a square of land"" (169), becoming one of the county's largest planters; he also becomes the partner of Ratcliffe in owning the settlement's store (173).  He is also identified as the father of ""General Compson, the first Jason's son"" (187).  In the main that account is consistent with what Faulkner says about Jason in the ""Appendix Compson"" that he wrote in the mid-1940s, where he has a middle name too. In 1799, as an ""infant,"" Jason Lycurgus was taken by his grandfather - the first Compson in America - from Carolina to Kentucky (326). He arrived at the Mississippi settlement in 1811. By racing his mare against the horses of Ikkemotubbe's men, Jason I won from Ikkemotubbe the ""solid square mile of land"" that would become the Compson Domain (328). His leadership role in <em>Requiem</em> makes plausible the suggestion that he is the ""Governor"" whom both Quentin III and Jason IV in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> refer to as ""one of our forefathers"" (101), but there are other candidates on the family tree for that title, as well as for the title 'first Compson in Yoknapatawpha' (see the entries for both this Jason's son, Quentin Compson II, and his grandson, Jason II).  As a man and an example of Yoknapatawpha's planter class, the outlines of his character recall Thomas Sutpen more than John Sartoris: an enterprising and ambitious man who works his way up to the big house on the big plantation.  As an inconsistency in the history of Yoknapatawpha, he's a reminder that Faulkner seldom worried about keeping all his imaginative 'facts' straight.</p>","Yes"
"18882","45","Charles Stuart Compson","Compson, Charles Stuart","Quentin Compson I","<p>According to the early genealogy that Faulkner's 1946 ""Appendix"" creates for the Compson family, Charles Stuart Compson is the first member to be born in the new world.  Named after Charles Stuart the Young Pretender, for whom his father fought in Scotland, Charles Stuart Compson served under the British commander Banastre Tarleton in the American Revolutionary War; Charles Stuart was thus part of the military serving the monarchy his father had formerly opposed.  After he is ""left for dead"" on a colonial battlefield (326), and with an amputated leg, he joins his son and father in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, where he tries a series of ventures: teaching school, gambling, and plotting against the American government to give Spain the Mississippi Valley.  Charles Stuart is notably ""vocal and vociferant,"" a trait that contributes to his self-imposed exile from the United States (327).</p>","No"
"18881","44","Quentin Compson I","Compson, Quentin MacLachan I","Father of Quentin MacLachan Compson","<p>When Faulkner creates four earlier generations of Compsons in the ""Appendix"" he wrote in 1945, Quentin MacLachan Compson - the great-great-great grandfather of the Quentin Compson who appears in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> - is the first one who is given a first name.  This Quentin I is the ""son of a Glasgow printer, orphaned and raised by his mother's people"" (326) in the Perth Highlands.  He is driven from Culloden Moor, presumably as a result of the rebel Jacobites' last battle against the Hanovarian government of Britain, which occurred at that site in 1746, and flees across the Atlantic to Carolina.  In 1779, at age eighty, he flees from the American Revolutionary War to Kentucky with his grandson.  His entry in the ""Appendix"" is marked by repeated references to his tartan, which accompanies him through every stage of his migration.</p>","No"
"18879","43","Caspey Strother","Strother, Caspey","Simon Strother, Euphrony Strother","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Caspey is the son of Simon Strother and the brother of Elnora.  He is also one of the five men in the novel who are returning from France after the end of World War I.  Caspey served in a non-combatant role with the U.S. Army over there; when he returned home to Jefferson, he brought with him some wildly exaggerated tales about his military service, and a set of new ideas about racial equality which made his family very nervous and drove Old Bayard to knock him down with a stick of stove wood. After that he seems willing to accept his place as a servant of the Sartorises, at least for the rest of the novel.  He is mentioned again in ""There Was a Queen,"" where he is now identified as ""Elnora's husband"" (727).  He is no longer on the Sartoris place, but instead serving a sentence in the penitentiary ""for stealing"" (727).  No other details about his life are provided.</p>","Yes"
"18878","42","Philadelphy","Philadelphy","","<p>Philadelphy - almost certainly a corruption of ""Philadelphia,"" the name she has in ""My Grandmother Millard"" (668) - is, like her husband Loosh, a slave on the Sartoris plantation.  She is what is sometimes called a 'house slave,' i.e. one of the slaves who work inside the white family's mansion rather than in the cotton fields. We see her serving as a maid in ""My Grandmother Millard,"" which Faulkner wrote half a dozen years after <em>The Unvanquished</em> was published. But Philadelphy's essential role the two <em>Unvanquished</em> stories in which she appears is to try to resist Loosh's desire for freedom.  ""I tried to stop him, Miss Rosa,"" she tells her mistress three times in ""Retreat"" (35); she agrees with Rosa that following the Union army will only lead them ""into misery and starvation,"" but goes because ""he my husband"" (35).  While she's away with him, her name appears in ""Raid"" as a source of miscommunication when a Yankee soldier mistakes it for the name of a town in Mississippi (Philadelphia).  Loosh has returned to Sartoris by the end of <em>The Unvanquished</em>, but after she ""went on"" with him at the end of ""Retreat,"" Philadelphia is not mentioned again.</p>","Yes"
"18877","41","Isom Strother","Strother, Isom","Elnora Strother","<p>Isom is Elnora's only child in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, ""a negro lad lean and fluid of movement as a hound"" (20). He is responsible for a number of chores around the Sartoris household, but most enjoys wearing Caspey's military uniform and taking the wheel of Bayard's car. There is no hint of how, if at all, he is being educated.  He is at the wheel of a car again ten years later in <em>Sanctuary</em>, where he is ""the negro driver"" who works for Narcissa Sartoris (110) - and the only member of the Strother family who is included in the novel.  And the issue of his education arises in ""There Was a Queen,"" where he is one of three children of Elnora; along with her and a sister, he still lives in the cabin at the Sartoris place that his family has occupied since some of them were enslaved and still works for the Sartoris family as a servant who ""tends the grounds"" (728).  But it's noteworthy that this text does mention the fact that he has been to school, though it's also worth noting that based on what he tells his mother about what he ""learnt"" there (732) - ""what the book say in school"" about the distance between Carolina and Yoknapatawpha (733) - that education was not very effective.</p>","Yes"
"18876","40","Saddie","Saddie","Elnora Strother","<p>One of Elnora's three children in the short story ""There Was a Queen,"" Saddie works as Miss Jenny's caretaker, ""tending her as though she were a baby"" (728).  ""Saddie"" may be a corruption of 'Saturday.'  She sleeps in the big house, ""on a cot beside Virginia Du Pre's bed"" (728). Genealogically, she is Miss Jenny's great-niece, the illegitimate granddaughter of her brother John, though that relationship is not discussed by any of the characters.  (In the earlier novel <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Elnora has only one child - Isom.)</p>","Yes"
"18875","39","Joby 2","Joby 2","Elnora Strother, Caspey Strother","<p>This Joby is Elnora's son and the (presumably) older brother of Isom and Saddie.  The only information we have about him is that he has ""gone to Memphis to wear fine clothes on Beale Street"" (727).  He plays no role in the plot of the story.  (There is another Joby in the Strother family - during the Civil War he is a slave and afterwards a servant of the Sartorises - but he is the great-grandfather of this Joby.  This Joby only appears in ""There Was a Queen."")</p>","Yes"
"18874","38","Elnora Strother","Strother, Elnora","Euphrony Strother, John Sartoris I","<p>The very first time Elnora appears in the very first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, she is described as ""a tall mulatto woman"" (9).  Although that term is no longer in use, Faulkner's contemporaries knew it meant a person with one white and one black parent.  The story that lies latent in that term is never developed in <em>Flags</em>, where as ""Simon's tall yellow daughter"" (36), the sister of Caspey and the mother of Isom, Elnora's role seems mainly to provide a kind of African American soundtrack for the Sartoris story, or as one passage puts it: ""In the kitchen Elnora crooned mellowly as she labored"" (222).  Her loyalty to the Sartoris family she serves appears again in ""All the Dead Pilots,"" which mentions the socks that she knitted and sent to a young Sartoris away at the First World War.  But in the story ""There Was a Queen"" Faulkner excavates that term ""mulatto"" a bit more when he reveals that Elnora's father is Colonel John Sartoris, and so she is an (illegitimate) member of the family she serves.  The story that story goes on to tell is <em>not</em> Elnora's, though she narrates a good bit of it.  From her position in the kitchen as a black servant rather than as a Sartoris who is half white, she recounts for her children Isom and Saddie the Sartoris family history, referring to her own (unacknowledged) father as ""Old Marse John"" and explaining why Miss Jenny, born a Sartoris and the ""queen"" of the title, is ""quality"" while Narcissa, who marries a Sartoris, is ""trash"" (734).  Letting Elnora identify an upper class white woman as ""trash"" does confer a kind of narrative authority on her, but she never seems aware of the irony of laboring so hard to establish the idea that Narcissa ""won't never be a Sartoris woman,"" when it's even truer that, despite her genealogical credentials, she won't ever be one either (730).  After ""There Was a Queen,"" however, Faulkner will go on to write novels like <em>Absalom!</em> and <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, which look much more deeply into the cultural and moral depths that reside in that term ""mulatto.""</p>","Yes"
"18873","37","Euphrony Strother","Strother, Euphrony","","<p>Euphrony is briefly mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> as Simon's dead wife, which presumably also makes her the mother of Elnora and Caspey (300).  Since Elnora is described by the narrator as a ""tall mulatto woman"" (9), it seems to follow that Euphrony must have had a sexual relationship with a white man, but this novel makes no attempt to explore that issue.  On the other hand, in ""There Was a Queen"" Elnora's mother is not named, but her (white) father is identified as Colonel John Sartoris.  Again, however, no more is said about that.  But the story here, about how sex and family cross the lines between white and black and master and slave, is one Faulkner will return to.</p>","Yes"
"18872","36","Ringo","Ringo","Simon Strother","<p>Ringo - short for Marengo, the name of Napoleon's horse - was born into slavery as a member of the black family that has served the Sartorises for several generations.  He appears in all the stories that Bayard Sartoris narrates, as a major character in the seven that were collected in <em>The Unvanquished</em> and a somewhat reduced one in the later ""My Grandmother Millard.""  Even as a slave he occupies an intimate place in the Sartoris family, as both Bayard's personal servant and his friend. He even calls Colonel Sartoris' mother-in-law Rosa ""Granny,"" just like Bayard, a detail that suggests to some readers that he may in fact be an illegitimate child of the Colonel's; however, the stories never acknowledge that possibility, nor, curiously, ever mention his mother.  (He is not given a father either, until Faulkner revised ""Ambuscade"" as the first chapter in <em>The Unvanquished</em>: there Bayard says that Simon is ""Ringo's father,"" 17).  According to Bayard, as boys he and Ringo are so close that there is no color line separating them.  While this isn't quite true (for example, Ringo serves the white family in the dining room but eats his own meals with his family in the kitchen) the adventures he shares with Bayard during the Civil War do transform the conventional profile of a slave: he helps Bayard, for example, shoot a rifle at a Yankee, and still more transgressively, at another point whips Ab Snopes, a white man, in revenge for Granny's death.  Both the Colonel and Bayard acknowledge that Ringo is the ""smarter"" of the two boys, and his actions as the second-in-command of Granny's non-military campaign against the Union troops in Mississippi display his considerable executive skills.  But Ringo is entirely loyal to the Sartoris family and its interests.  Even after Emancipation he continues to live at Sartoris, although in a cabin rather than in the mansion that he helps rebuild after the war, and actively participates in the actions taken by the white men of Jefferson to keep other freedmen from voting during Reconstruction.  By then the color line between him and Bayard has become impermeable.  Ten years after the war, Bayard is studying law at the University of Mississippi, while Ringo remains at Sartoris as a servant of some kind.  He is also mentioned by a character in one other text, <em>The Hamlet</em>, though by a racial epithet rather than by name.</p>","Yes"
"18871","35","Loosh","Loosh","Joby 1","<p>Loosh - or Lucius, as he's called in ""My Grandmother Millard"" and, presumably, as he was actually named - appears or is mentioned in four of the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories as well as ""My Grandmother.""  Biologically, he is the son of Joby and Louvinia, the husband of Philadelphy, and the uncle of Ringo.  Thematically, he is the only slave on the Sartoris plantation (and one of the few in the Yoknapatawpha fictions) who openly rebels against his enslavement.  He eagerly awaits the coming of the Union army as his opportunity for freedom, helps them pillage the Sartoris property, and, before following them away, eloquently defends his actions: ""I don't belong to John Sartoris now,"" he says in ""Retreat"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>; ""I belongs to me and God"" (35, 75).  We never learn what he and his wife experienced after they emancipate themselves.  At the end of <em>The Unvanquished</em>, however, which takes place a decade after the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, Loosh is back working in the stable at Sartoris, apparently content in that place.  When Faulkner returns in ""My Grandmother Millard"" to Sartoris and the story of the white and black families that live there during the Civil War, Lucius' quest for freedom is portrayed as a kind of comedy.  In that story too he proclaims his plans ""to be long gone"" as soon as the Yankee army arrives in Yoknapatawpha (669), and soon the Yankees are at hand, but when Rosa sends Lucius on an errand, instead of finding and following them, he gets lost for four days before returning to the plantation (690).</p>","Yes"
"18870","34","Simon Strother","Strother, Simon","Joby 1","<p>Simon first appears, in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, as the elderly father of Elnora and Caspey and the coachman and butler at the Sartoris place where he has lived his whole life.  He is defined by his loyalty to both the Sartorises and his own appetites.  The grandson of Joby, Simon was born a slave, but he has only good memories of the old plantation, and still calls Colonel Sartoris ""Marse John"" when he talks to him, and he still talks to him although ""Marse John"" has been dead for forty years (112). Simon is shrewd enough to know how to manipulate his current employer, John's son Bayard, whom Simon calls ""Cunnel,"" but the language the narrator uses to describe Simon is often extremely racist, i.e. ""his apelike head"" (239).  At the end of this novel Simon is found murdered in the cabin of a ""mulatto"" woman to whom he had given money that he embezzled from the Baptist church (394).  He re-appears as a slave in <em>The Unvanquished</em>, which mentions him early as ""Ringo's father"" (17) and depicts him later as a grief-stricken mourner beside Colonel John's coffin (241).  In between these two texts Faulkner complicates the relationship between Simon's family and the white family it serves across these generations when, in ""There Was a Queen,"" he describes Simon not as Elnora's father but as ""Elnora's mother's husband"" (727) - a locution that reflects the fact disclosed at the start of the story: that Elnora's father is in fact Colonel John.  ""There Was a Queen"" takes place ten years after Simon's death, so how Simon himself lived with that fact remains a question that Faulkner's texts never ask, much less answer.</p>","Yes"
"18869","33","Louvinia","Louvinia","","<p>Born into slavery, Louvinia appears in two novels and seven stories as the cook at the Sartoris plantation and, along with her husband Joby, the head of the enslaved family that serves the Sartorises over many generations.  When we first meet her, in the story Will Falls tells in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> about the day the Yankees arrived at Sartoris hoping to capture Colonel John, Louvinia is ""shellin' a bowl of peas fer supper"" (20); she helps her master escape out the back door.  She plays a larger part in the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories about the plantation during the Civil War that John's son Bayard narrates.   As the mother of Loosh, the one member of her family who rebels against his enslavement, she tries to protect him from his own anger, and after he follows the Union army toward freedom she pleads with Rosa Millard in ""Raid"" to ""whup him"" until he agrees to come back home (38).  But she also 'mothers' Bayard and Ringo, her grandson, and in ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" emotionally consoles another member of the white family she continues to serve, even after the abolition of slavery: ""holding Drusilla in her arms,"" Bayard writes, ""like she used to hold me"" (65).  She even takes charge of Rosa once, holding her to keep her from confronting the Yankees who are sacking the plantation.  Louvinia is still in the kitchen at Sartoris ten years later, when we see her for the last time in <em>The Unvanquished</em> (242).</p>","Yes"
"18868","32","Joby 1","Joby 1","","<p>Joby is the oldest among the family of enslaved people who serve as the 'house slaves' of the Sartoris family in two novels and more than half a dozen short stories.  He first appears, very briefly, in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, in the stories Jenny tells about the old days on the plantation; there he is ""Simon's grandfather"" who helped bury the white family's silver under ""the ammoniac barn floor"" to hide it from Yankees during the Civil War (37).  In the stories Bayard tells later in the <em>Unvanquished</em> series, he is Simon's father, and he helps bury the silver (repeatedly) in the plantation's orchard.  What remains the same in every text is his loyalty to the Sartoris family. ""Skirmish at Sartoris,"" for example, takes place after Emancipation, but even then Joby remains on the plantation, helping to rebuild - or to use a more loaded term, 'reconstruct' - the Sartoris mansion that the Yankees have destroyed.  He is the husband of Louvinia and the grandfather of Ringo, both also enslaved and loyal, and the father of Loosh, the one Sartoris slave who rebels against his enslavement.  Joby himself, however, is invariably depicted serving his masters in one or another way, though he allows himself to complain quietly against some of their commands.  He is either the great- or the great-great-grandfather of the Joby who appears in ""There Was a Queen,"" which was published between <em>Flags</em> and the first <em>Unvanquished</em> stories.</p>","Yes"
"18867","31","Horace Benbow","Benbow, Horace","Will Benbow, Julia Benbow","<p>In the larger narrative of Yoknapatawpha Horace Benbow's place is a curious one.  One of the two central characters in the first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, Horace becomes the first major recurring character in the canon when Faulkner casts him as the protagonist of <em>Sanctuary</em>. After that second appearance he essentially disappears.  In <em>Flags</em> he is, like Bayard Sartoris, both the male descendant of one of the county's most aristocratic families and also a member of the 'lost generation.'  Though he went to World War I as a non-combatant, his attempt to come home afterwards is as unsuccessful as Bayard's.  His affair with the married Belle Mitchell comes between him and his sister Narcissa, and ends up sending him too into a very modernist exile at the end of the novel.  He is again trying to go home again ten years later in <em>Sanctuary</em>.  Although his passion for Belle is gone, he remains a squeamish idealist.  But the sexual anxieties he is fleeing from are only exascerbated by the Gothic world he enters at the Old Frenchman place, a decaying antebellum plantation house that becomes the site of murder and rape.  His quest to discover the truth about what happened there makes him the first of the many 'detectives' in Faulkner's fiction, but it is compromised by his futile longing to protect his own innocence.  ""Futility,"" in fact, sums up the essential truth about his character: as a kind of artist and lover in <em>Flags</em> or as an attorney and detective in <em>Sanctuary</em>.  In the end of the second novel he goes back to his marriage, and is seen again only once in the fictions, when the narrator of ""There Was a Queen"" mentions that Narcissa has a ""brother"" (735).  On the other hand, in a sense Horace does return in later texts: there are a lot of affinities between him and Faulkner's favorite character, Gavin Stevens.</p>","Yes"
"18866","30","Narcissa Benbow Sartoris","Sartoris, Narcissa Benbow","Will Benbow, Julia Benbow","<p>Narcissa is born into one of Yoknapatawpha's leading families and marries into another.  She plays a major role in three early fictions, which together even form a kind of asymmetrical trilogy.  In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> she is the most eligible young woman in Jefferson before she becomes Mrs. Bayard Sartoris.  In that novel her role is essentially passive, as she is courted or stalked by men from three very different classes; by the end of it she is a young widow with a newborn son, whom she names Benbow Sartoris.  In <em>Sanctuary</em>, on the other hand, she plays a more active and less attractive role, as she tries to protect her reputation against her brother Horace's quixotic involvement with a former prostitute and a moonshiner.  The narrator of <em>Flags</em> repeatedly associates with her with the adjective ""serene"" - her brother even calls her ""O Serene"" (172); that word recurs in <em>Sanctuary</em>, but now it is often paired with the word ""stupid"" (25).  The narrative of ""There Was a Queen"" returns to the story of the anonymous quasi-obscene letters Byron Snopes sent her in <em>Flags</em>.  The means by which she recovers them may not prove, as one of the Sartoris servants says, that she is ""trash"" (734), but it does make it clear that despite her pedigree and her possession of the Sartoris estate, ""She won't never be a Sartoris woman"" (730).  Unlike her brother, she is mentioned, briefly, in later texts, though her role in the final two volumes of Faulkner's better-known trilogy about the Snopeses is very minor.</p>","Yes"
"18865","29","Julia Benbow","Benbow, Julia","","<p>Julia Benbow, the wife of Will Benbow, and mother of Horace and Narcissa, is mentioned in both <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and <em>Sanctuary</em>.  According to the first novel, she died when Narcissa was seven years old. Narcissa remembers her as ""a gentle figure . . . like a minor shrine, surrounded always by an aura of gentle melancholy and an endless and delicate manipulation of colored silken thread"" (172).  She is not named in the second novel, and appears only in Narcissa's references to ""my father and mother"" (118) and ""our father and mother"" in conversations with Horace (184).</p>","Yes"
"18864","28","Will Benbow","Benbow, Will","Francis Benbow","<p>Will Benbow is presumably the only son of Francis.  He is mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> and <em>Sanctuary</em>.  He married Julia, with whom he had two children, Horace and Narcissa, and practiced law in Jefferson.  He died a few years before the U.S. entered World War I.  Narcissa remembers him in the first novel as ""a darkly gallant shape"" - ""a being something like Omnipotence but without awesomeness"" (172).  He is not mentioned by name in <em>Sanctuary</em>, but only appears in Narcissa's references to ""my father and mother"" (118) and ""our father and mother"" (184).</p>","Yes"
"18863","27","Percy Benbow","Benbow, Percy","Francis Benbow","<p>In the Yoknapatawpha fictions as a group, the Benbows are among the county's oldest and most prominent families, but the reference in <em>Absalom!</em> to Judge Benbow's son is ""Percy"" is the only mention of this character in the canon (172).  Chronologically it is possible that Percy is brother of Will Benbow, the Benbow who is the father of Horace and Narcissa Benbow, major figures in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> (1929) and <em>Sanctuary</em> (1931), but that is speculation.</p>","Yes"
"18862","26","Francis Benbow","Benbow, Francis","Judge Benbow","<p>Francis Benbow is the father of Will Benbow, and grandfather of Horace and Narcissa.

When he went to the island, however, or what he did there, is not explained.</p>","Yes"
"18861","25","Judge Benbow","Benbow, Judge","","<p>As a family the Benbows are one of the oldest and most prominent in Jefferson, but the fictions don't provide much detail about the first several generations in town.  ""Judge Benbow"" is mentioned in three fictions from the middle of Faulkner's career.  In <em>Absalom!</em> he is mentioned twice: first as a paragon of genteel manners (35), and later as the unofficial executor of the (non-existent) ""Estate of Goodhue Coldfield"" who chivalrously takes care of Rosa over the years (172); he also has a son named Percy.  In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Judge Benbow dissolves the business partnership between Ben Redmond and John Sartoris.  In <em>The Hamlet</em> he is cited as the source of an epigram about Will Varner: ""Judge Benbow of Jefferson once said of him that ""a milder mannered man never bled a mule or stuffed a ballot box"" (6).  Presumably this is the <em>same</em> Judge Benbow in each case, but that's an assumption.</p>","Yes"
"18860","24","Earliest American Sartoris","Sartoris, Earliest American","","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> Jenny Du Pre refers to the man who built the plantation where she grew up in ""Carolina"" (whether North or South is never specified) as her ""great-great-great-grandfather"" (50).

She is identified mainly by her ""wild bronze swirling"" hair (45), but she is also recognizably a modern woman: she has no proper ideas about ""keeping house,"" at least according to Jenny (51), and the narrator refers to ""the brittle daring of her speech and actions"" (73).  She and her newborn son died, perhaps of influenza, in 1918, while her husband was fighting overseas in World War I.</p>","Yes"

In ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" he accompanies his mother on her trip to Yoknapatawpha, and on the day of the election, without her permission, goes into town with Ringo.

"18855","19","Du Pre","Du Pre","","<p>The husband of Virginia Sartoris (Aunt Jenny) is a man named Du Pre.  According to <em>The Unvanquished</em>, one of the two fictions in which he is mentioned, he was ""killed at the very beginning of the War, by a shell from a Federal frigate at Fort Moultrie"" (235).  Fort Moultrie was one of the forts in the harbor at Charleston, South Carolina, and it's very likely that Du Pre, like the Sartorises, was from ""Cal-lina"" - as Elnora calls it in ""There Was a Queen,"" the other text in which Jenny's husband is mentioned (732).  In that story Elnora agrees that ""the Yankees"" killed him in the Civil War (732).  Neither text says more about him, but from that aristocratic ""Du"" in his name, not to mention the fact that Virginia Sartoris married him, it's safe to say that he also belonged to the upper class.</p>","No"
"18854","18","Louisa Hawk","Hawk, Louisa","","<p>This sister of Rosa Millard appears or is mentioned in three of the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories.  When she first appears, in ""Raid,"" she is named ""Louise""; her husband and son have both been killed in the Civil War, and the large Dennison plantation has been burned by the Yankees.  Louise tries, ineffectually, to keep her daughter Drusilla from helping Rosa conduct her non-military raid on the Union troops in the area.  As ""Louisa"" in ""Skirmish at Sartoris,"" on the other hand, she takes a much more aggressive line of attack against Drusilla's attempts to ""flout and outrage all Southern principles of purity and womanhood,"" as she herself puts it (62).  For Louisa ""the highest destiny of a Southern woman"" is to be ""the widow of a lost cause"" (61), and she enlists the ladies of Yoknapatawpha in a campaign to make Drusilla put on the dress that is the uniform of that ideal, let her hair grow longer, and marry John Sartoris. Louisa's character is defined by the handkerchief she carries ""that made the whole cabin smell like dead roses"" (67), and the ""wad of some kind of black knitting"" that she is always working on but never finishes (68).</p>","Yes"
"18853","17","Millard","Millard","","<p>First mentioned but not named by Will Falls in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> when he mentions that Bayard's two sisters went to stay with his ""gran'pappy"" in Memphis during the Civil War (20), he comes into a little more focus in ""My Grandmother Millard"" when Bayard notes that his grandmother's dead husband owned a ""supply house"" in Memphis (688).  One of his customers was Nathan Bedford Forrest, who (although the story never mentions it) was a well-known Memphis planter and slave-dealer at that time.  He and Forrest ""sometimes"" sat together on the front porch and ""sometimes"" ate together too (688).</p>","No"
"18852","16","Virginia Sartoris Du Pre","Du Pre, Virginia Sartoris","Colonel John Sartoris&#039; Mother, Colonel John Sartoris&#039; Father","<p>Virginia Du Pre - or as she is called more frequently, Aunt Jenny - is the sister of Colonel John and the first in the series of formidable dowagers in the Yoknapatawpha fictions.  She traveled to Yoknapatawpha a few years after the end of the Civil War that saw her father and husband killed and the family mansion in Carolina burned down.  She brought with her a handful of flower cuttings from the ancestral estate which in Mississippi's less congenial soil she nurtures into an equally lush garden.  She also tends the 'Sartoris' legend with a mixture of feigned exasperation and genuine affection, keeping alive the stories of past greatness before and in the War.  She is not as un-Reconstructed as some of Faulkner's ladies, but in ""All the Dead Pilots"" she does tell her great-nephew to quit fighting in that ""Yankee"" war - i.e. World War I (531).  She is most impressive in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>; in <em>Sanctuary</em> (where as usual she does a lot of scolding but is not named) she is already in the wheel-chair in which she is sitting above her garden when she dies at twilight in ""There Was a Queen.""  How highly Faulkner's imagination regards her is indicated by the title of that story, which Faulkner also considered calling ""An Empress Passes.""  There is no one to take her place in the Sartoris family - in fact, the precipating factor in her death is the way the current 'Mrs. Sartoris,' Narcissa, betrays the ideals Jenny has sought to preserve - but in the fiction Faulkner writes she will be re-incarnated more than once.</p>","Yes"
"18851","15","Rosa Millard","Millard, Rosa","","<p>Rosa Millard - ""Granny"" to two boys, one white and one black - is one of Faulkner's most formidable old women. As John Sartoris' mother-in-law, she runs his plantation while he's away fighting in the Civil War.  She is the central figure in four of the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories, and her death provides the occasion for a fifth, ""Vendee""; several years after collecting those stories into <em>The Unvanquished</em>, Faulkner returned to her in the short story ""My Grandmother Millard and General Bedford Forrest and the Battle of Harrykin Creek.""  This story provides the most information about her life before she became part of the Sartoris family: her husband owned a ""supply house"" in Memphis, where the guests at her table included Forrest, who was at the time a slave trader (688).  In many ways she represents the ideal of the plantation mistress as imagined by the eulogists of slavery: she treats both the children and the slaves at Sartoris with firmness, and a kind of fond exasperation for their misbehavior - though she is quite severe with any slaves, including one on the plantation and the many whom she takes temporary charge of in ""Raid,"" who think they should be free from masters like herself.  On the other hand, she allows Ringo, the slave who calls her ""Granny,"" to become the second-in-command of her bloodless but dishonest campaign to make the Union troops in Mississippi provide for her family as well as the larger population of Yoknapatawpha.  She displays a command of traditionally feminine roles - teaching correct behavior and nurturning the community as well as sewing, cooking and gardening - but she proves equally up to the new challenges brought home by the war: she even shows General Forrest how to maintain command of his troops. But one can read the arc of her narrative in <em>The Unvanquished</em> more critically, as the record of her decline from a genteel, morally upright southern lady to one who is willing to lie, cheat, and even steal as the world around her is threatened with collapse.</p>","Yes"
"18850","14","Colonel John Sartoris' Daughter 2","Sartoris, Daughter of Colonel John2","John Sartoris I, Mrs. John Sartoris","<p>Faulkner's first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, explicitly mentions the two daughters of Colonel John Sartoris.  This is the younger one, who is two years younger than Bayard; with her older sister she was sent to Memphis during the Civil War, but is back at the Sartoris plantation at Christmas time, 1869, to hear Aunt Jenny tell the story of ""Carolina"" Bayard's death.  Other than that, like her sister she remains very elusive as a character.  (Faulkner presumably includes this daughter in the later short story ""There Was a Queen"" when Elnora mentions the Sartoris children, but that is an assumption.  Neither sister is mentioned in the still later novel <em>The Unvanquished</em>, although that is set during the Civil War and includes the idea of seeking refuge in Memphis.)</p>","Yes"
"18849","13","Colonel John Sartoris' Daughter 1","Sartoris, Daughter of Colonel John 1","John Sartoris I, Mrs. John Sartoris","<p>Like their mother, John Sartoris' two daughters are almost invisible members of the family.  This is the older of the pair, Bayard's older sister.  She is twenty-two when Jenny Du Pre arrives in Mississippi in 1869; beyond that she is not named or described. From one of Will Falls' stories in Flags in the Dust we learn that she and her younger sister were sent to Memphis during the Civil War; the narrator tells us later that she is planning to marry in June, 1870.  Although John Sartoris' 'children' are mentioned again in ""There Was a Queen"" (733), there is no further mention of either of his daughters.</p>","Yes"
"18848","12","Drusilla Hawk Sartoris","Sartoris, Drusilla Hawk","Dennison Hawk I","<p>Although she only appears in the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories, Drusilla Hawk Sartoris is one of the more memorable women in the Yoknapatawpha fictions.  She was born in Alabama into the plantation aristocracy, where her role as a lady seemed clearly defined - until the Civil War gave her the opportunity to redefine it. After her father and fiance are killed at the Battle of Shiloh, she ""deliberately tries to unsex"" herself (189), according to her appalled mother, by refusing to mourn them and instead cutting her hair short and riding off ""astride"" her horse (not sidesaddle) to join the Confederate unit led by her cousin, John Sartoris, in the fighting. Faulkner never describes her behavior in combat, though she doesn't mince words about saying that she ""went to the War to hurt Yankees"" (197).  When she comes to Yoknapatawpha with John after the surrender, she continues to dress and act like the males rebuilding the Sartoris plantation until she herself is forced to surrender - not to the Yankees but to her mother and the other ladies who demand that she put on a dress and marry the man she has been fighting and sleeping beside. When John appoints her ad hoc ""voting commissioner"" of Yoknapatawpha, a very implausible role for a woman, she is wearing a wedding dress (210). As John's wife she is (briefly) her step-son's temptation in the garden at Sartoris - or as Bayard puts it, the ""woman of thirty, the symbol of the ancient and eternal Snake"" (228).  As John's widow at the end of <em>The Unvanquished</em> she exhorts Bayard to avenge John's death with the pair of phallic pistols she holds out to him; having put the dress back on, she apparently never considers firing them herself.  When Bayard resists that temptation, she leaves Yoknapatawpha to be with her younger brother Denny in Alabama. Before she departs, however, she leaves on Bayard's pillow a single sprig of verbena which, according to her, has the only odor one can smell above the ""smell of horses and courage"" (220).</p>","Yes"
"18847","11","Dennison Hawk I","Hawk, Dennison I","","<p>Like John Sartoris, Dennison Hawk was a large plantation- and slave-owner who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War; he was killed at the Battle of Shiloh.  He never appears directly in the fictions, but is mentioned in ""Raid"" and ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" and again in <em>The Unvanquished</em>.  His Alabama plantation, Hawkhurst, was burned by the Yankees sometime after his death. He is the husband of Louisa, who is Granny's sister, and hence he is Bayard's uncle as well as Drusilla's and Denny's father.</p>","No"
"18846","10","Mrs. John Sartoris","Sartoris, Mrs. John","Rosa Millard, Millard","<p>Colonel John Sartoris' wife and (Old) Bayard's mother is a very elusive figure.  In the <em>Unvanquished</em> series it emerges that her maiden name was Millard, and it can be assumed that she originally came from Memphis (where Rosa Millard and her husband lived before the Civil War). In ""My Grandmother Millard"" Bayard notes that Cousin Melisandre is married in the same wedding dress that both her grandmother and mother wore at their weddings, and says that ""Mother wasn't much older than Cousin Melisandre even when she died"" - and Melisandre is a very young woman (698-99).  In <em>The Unvanquished</em> Bayard says that that death took place ""when I was born,"" but in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, the other novel in which Mrs. John Sartoris is mentioned, it is clear that Bayard has a younger sister.  The only time Mrs. Sartoris appears in the fictions occurs very fleetingly in that novel, in Simon's account of Bayard's birth, when all the slaves from the quarters came up to the big house to wish ""Mistis en de little marster well"" (392).</p>","Yes"
"18845","9","Bayard Sartoris IV","Sartoris, Bayard IV","Bayard Sartoris III, Caroline White Sartoris","<p>This is the only child of young Bayard's short-lived marriage to Caroline White.  According to Jenny Du Pre, Caroline named him Bayard ""nine months before it was born"" (51).  He and his mother both died while Bayard was in France, though <em>Flags in the Dust</em> does not explain the cause.</p>","Yes"
"18844","8","Benbow Sartoris","Sartoris, Benbow","Bayard Sartoris III, Narcissa Benbow Sartoris","<p>The country boy who narrates ""Shall Not Perish"" notes that Sartorises ""still lived in our county"" in 1942 (112).  In the collected fictions, however, there is only one Sartoris left by that time, the son of Bayard Sartoris III and Narcissa Benbow who was born on the same day his father died in 1920, at the end of <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, and given his name as his mother's attempt to avoid the apparent curse on the various Bayards and Johns in the Sartoris line of succession.  Given Faulkner's imaginative investment in the Sartoris family (they appear in 26 stories and novels, more than any other recurring family), after this first novel he pays surprising little attention to the boy.  He re-appears at age ten in <em>Sanctuary</em> and ""There Was a Queen.""  He is briefly mentioned in three other texts, including ""Knight's Gambit,"" which reports that he has been sent to England on ""something hush hush"" for the war effort in World War II (251), keeping alive the Sartoris tradition of serving in the military.  Even the later fictions, however, are equally secretive about the fate of the Sartorises as a family.</p>","Yes"
"18843","7","John Sartoris III","Sartoris, John III","John Sartoris II, Mrs. John Sartoris","<p>Johnny Sartoris, the twin brother of Bayard, is one of the two Sartoris ghosts who haunt the present in Faulkner's first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>.  Confederate Colonel John haunts all his living descendants.  'British' aviator Johnny is instead the shadow that his brother cannot emerge from.  He is remembered very fondly by the novel's other characters, and with a great deal of survivor guilt by Bayard.  Before World War I Johnny attended the University of Virginia and Princeton University.  Serving in France, he is killed in aerial combat while his brother looks on helplessly, embracing his death with a gesture that combines noblesse oblige with modern insouciance, and apparently fulfilling his destiny as a 'Sartoris' in a way Bayard can never compete with (though his own death in an airplane in the skies over Ohio has to be understood as a diminished echo of John's in the skies over France).   Most of the other five texts in which Johnny is mentioned don't add anything to the story that in a sense is already over before <em>Flags</em> even begins, but Johnny is a major character in ""All the Dead Pilots,"" one of the short stories Faulkner set in World War I Europe.  There his experiences in the 'Great War' are considerably less mythic.  They involve an ongoing rivalry with another pilot named Spoomer, where they fight over women rather than a more noble cause.  In that story Johnny is ""humorless"" (515), sardonic, and self-confident, all of which appear in his offer to teach Spoomer how to fly just to ""run him out of the sky in four minutes. I will run him so far into the ground he will have to stand on his head to swallow"" (521).  Even this ironic (anti)war story, however, is introduced by a narrator who says he is telling it to explain how ""all the pilots"" - especially the ones who survived physically - were killed by what happened to them in the war.</p>","Yes"
"18842","6","Bayard Sartoris III","Sartoris, Bayard III","John Sartoris II, Mrs. John Sartoris","<p>Although this Bayard, the third on the Sartoris family tree, has a son, <em>The Mansion</em>, the second to last text Faulkner published, is not wrong to call this Bayard ""the last Sartoris Mohican"" (210).  He appears or is mentioned in seven texts. His one major appearance is in the first, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, which is organized around his story as a member of the 'Lost Generation' who cannot go home again after going through the First World War as an aviator - or as Faulkner puts it in <em>Requiem for a Nun</em>, using the terminology of a later World War, as ""a combat airman"" (190). The great-grandson of Colonel John Sartoris, he survives the war physically.  Psychologically wounded, however, by having witnessed the death of his twin brother and fellow aviator Johnny he returns to a South that has never recovered from the earlier Civil War.   Dispossessed by both wars, Bayard sends himself into exile at the end of that first novel, and dies in a meaningless accident.  In ""Ad Astra,"" one of the stories Faulkner set in World War I France, he appears among a group of similarly afflicted and alcoholic veterans.  But while several other texts repeat his story, only one of them develops his character any further: in <em>The Mansion</em> at the other end of his career Faulkner has Gavin Stevens and his twin sister Maggie Mallison suggest other, much less glamorous explanations for Bayard's self-destructive despair (210-12) than the ""glamorous fatality"" (404) he mourns and exalts in <em>Flags</em>, the tragic fate of being born into a world that no longer has a place for a 'Sartoris.'</p>","Yes"
"18841","5","John Sartoris II","Sartoris, John II","Bayard Sartoris II, Mrs. Bayard Sartoris","<p>Bayard Sartoris names his only son John, after his father the Colonel.  This John II is a very minor character, even in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, the only text to describe him or rather his life in any detail.  He married Lucy Cranston,  with whom he fathered the twin sons, Bayard (III) and John (III), who are both important characters in that first Yoknapatawpha fiction. Unlike his father, he followed the family's military tradition, fighting for the U.S. in the Spanish-American War.  He died in 1901, succumbing to yellow fever and a wound suffered during the war.</p>","Yes"
"18840","4","Bayard Sartoris II","Sartoris, Bayard II","John Sartoris I, Mrs. John Sartoris","<p>This Bayard Sartoris, the second on the family tree, is the son of Colonel John.  In many of the eighteen texts in which he appears he is often called ""Colonel Sartoris"" too, even though he never fought in any war.  In the larger story of Yoknapatawpha he is a transitional figure between the heroic past, when his father fought Yankees and built railroads, and modernity.  His greatest achievement is to establish a bank in Jefferson, though it ultimately ends up in the hands of a Snopes.  The war he carries on is not against Yankees but against time and change: at home this means beating an uppity black servant back into his place (<em>Flags</em>, 80); during his tenure as mayor of Jefferson, he passes an ""edict that no Negro woman should appear on the streets without an apron"" (""A Rose for Emily,"" 119-20).  The futility of his fight, however, is signified by the way, after his staunch antipathy to automobiles, he ends up dying as the result of an automobile accident involving a Ford.  In the larger story of Faulkner's art, he is the narrator of the seven <em>Unvanquished</em> stories, where his young perspective is the lens through which Faulkner looks at the 'old plantation' as it is challenged by the exigencies of war and emancipation.  At the (chronological) end of those stories, Bayard inherits the title of ""The Sartoris"" (214), and in that role suggests, with a heroism that looks less glamorous than his father's swashbuckling but is nonetheless impressive, a way to reconcile the code of the Southern aristocrat with the values of the New Testament.  But by a paradox that recurs often in Faulkner, the possible future that Bayard's action might portend has already been placed in the past by the a-chronological way Faulkner tells his story: we see him first as the old man standing guard over the gestures of a lost world before we see him as the young man who might provide a way - to use a loaded term - to reconstruct his own time and place.</p>","Yes"
"18839","3","Bayard Sartoris I","Sartoris, Bayard I","Colonel John Sartoris&#039; Mother, Colonel John Sartoris&#039; Father","<p>This is the first of the four 'Bayards' on the Sartoris family tree.  When Colonel John Sartoris' sister Virginia (Aunt Jenny) Du Pre comes to Yoknapatawpha from Carolina, she brings with her the story she loves to tell the younger members of her family about her bother Bayard's death in the Civil War.  To her, at least, and in these stories, this Bayard is an incredibly romantic figure, likened to ""Richard First . . . before he went crusading"" (11). During the Civil War he is Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's dashing aide-de-camp who is killed when he rides alone into a Union camp to disprove the assertion that ""No gentleman has any business in this war"" (17).  There is nothing particularly glamorous about the actual fact of his death: he is shot in the back by an unnamed Union cook.  But in Jenny's tellings the event becomes ""a gallant and finely tragical focal-point to which the history of the race had been raised"" (10) - and ultimately, in the way it surrounds the name and legend of ""Sartoris"" with similarly grandiloquent rhetoric, the novel seems to support Jenny's myth-making.</p>","No"
"18838","1","John Sartoris I","Sartoris, John I","Colonel John Sartoris&#039; Mother, Colonel John Sartoris&#039; Father","<p>The first published Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, begins by conjuring up the spirit of Colonel John Sartoris.  Dead since 1876, he haunts much of that text and many of the others; the 21 texts he appears in is the most of any inhabitant of Faulkner's imaginative world.  As Faulkner acknowledged, his story is basely on the life and death of Colonel William Falkner, the author's great-grandfather.  His fictional biography is established in that first novel.  He came from Carolina to Jefferson around 1837, where he built a large cotton plantation four miles north of town.  (<em>Requiem for a Nun</em> goes into the most detail about his arrival.)  Before the Civil War he married a woman who remains essentially invisible, with whom he fathered three children, two daughters whose names are never revealed and a son, Bayard.  That son narrates the <em>Unvanquished</em> stories that depict Sartoris' actions during and immediately after the War, as the head of an irregular Confederate troop, a violent opponent of Reconstruction, and the creator of the railroad that runs through the middle of Yoknapatawpha on both the maps that Faulkner drew. (<em>The Mansion</em> calls that railroad ""the biggest thing to happen in Yoknapatawpha County,"" 446.)  Beyond noting how loyal all but one of his slaves are to him, the fictions are not interested in his behavior as a slave owner (though ""There Was a Queen"" acknowledges that one of the servants at Sartoris is his illegitimate, biracial child).  To Quentin Compson in <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> he appears in his Confederate uniform as an image of a nobler past that is gone.  The justice of the peace in ""Barn Burning"" is sure that anyone named after Colonel Sartoris can be trusted (4).  Bayard's vision of his father is more ambivalent, acknowledging the (white) men whom the Colonel killed in his quest for power.  He is by turns a cavalier and a capitalist, but in general the fictions hold him up as a contrast to the other, less admirable plantation- and slave-owners, like Thomas Sutpen or Carothers McCaslin.  At the end of <em>Flags</em> his statue stands tall over the cemetery in Jefferson that contains his male descendants, an apt symbol of the great past that is never dead but is nonetheless gone.</p>","Yes"
"18837","2","Colonel John Sartoris' Mother","Sartoris, Mother of Colonel John","","<p>The mother of John and (the first) Bayard Sartoris and Virginia Du Pre is never named, and only mentioned in three texts, each time briefly.  ""There Was a Queen"" notes that the ""Cal-lina"" (Carolina, probably South) mansion she lived in was burned down by the Yankees during the Civil War (732).  But her presence remains in the mansion that her son builds in Yoknapatawpha - in the panes of colored glass that adorn a doorway, referred to in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> as her ""deathbed legacy to her son"" (10) and brought to Mississippi in 1869 by Aunt Jenny; and in the ""medallion"" of her that John's mother-in-law keeps out of the hands of the Yankees in ""My Grandmother Millard"" (670).</p>","No"
