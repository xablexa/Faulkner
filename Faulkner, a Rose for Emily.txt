“A Rose for Emily”
by William Faulkner (1930)
I
WHEN Miss Emily Grierson died, our whole town went to her funeral: the
men through a sort of respectful affection for a fallen monument, the
women mostly out of curiosity to see the inside of her house, which no
one save an old man-servant--a combined gardener and cook--had seen
in at least ten years.
It was a big, squarish frame house that had once been white, decorated
with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome
style of the seventies, set on what had once been our most select street.
But garages and cotton gins had encroached and obliterated even the
august names of that neighborhood; only Miss Emily's house was left,
lifting its stubborn and coquettish decay above the cotton wagons and
the gasoline pumps-an eyesore among eyesores. And now Miss Emily had
gone to join the representatives of those august names where they lay in
the cedar-bemused cemetery among the ranked and anonymous graves
of Union and Confederate soldiers who fell at the battle of Jefferson.
Alive, Miss Emily had been a tradition, a duty, and a care; a sort of
hereditary obligation upon the town, dating from that day in 1894 when
Colonel Sartoris, the mayor--he who fathered the edict that no Negro
woman should appear on the streets without an apron-remitted her
taxes, the dispensation dating from the death of her father on into
perpetuity. Not that Miss Emily would have accepted charity. Colonel
Sartoris invented an involved tale to the effect that Miss Emily's father had
loaned money to the town, which the town, as a matter of business,
preferred this way of repaying. Only a man of Colonel Sartoris' generation
and thought could have invented it, and only a woman could have
believed it.
When the next generation, with its more modern ideas, became mayors
and aldermen, this arrangement created some little dissatisfaction. On
the first of the year they mailed her a tax notice. February came, and
there was no reply. They wrote her a formal letter, asking her to call at
the sheriff's office at her convenience. A week later the mayor wrote her
himself, offering to call or to send his car for her, and received in reply a
note on paper of an archaic shape, in a thin, flowing calligraphy in faded
ink, to the effect that she no longer went out at all. The tax notice was
also enclosed, without comment.

They called a special meeting of the Board of Aldermen. A deputation
waited upon her, knocked at the door through which no visitor had
passed since she ceased giving china-painting lessons eight or ten years
earlier. They were admitted by the old Negro into a dim hall from which a
stairway mounted into still more shadow. It smelled of dust and disuse-a close, dank smell. The Negro led them into the parlor. It was furnished
in heavy, leather-covered furniture. When the Negro opened the blinds of
one window, they could see that the leather was cracked; and when they
sat down, a faint dust rose sluggishly about their thighs, spinning with
slow motes in the single sun-ray. On a tarnished gilt easel before the
fireplace stood a crayon portrait of Miss Emily's father.
They rose when she entered--a small, fat woman in black, with a thin
gold chain descending to her waist and vanishing into her belt, leaning
on an ebony cane with a tarnished gold head. Her skeleton was small and
spare; perhaps that was why what would have been merely plumpness in
another was obesity in her. She looked bloated, like a body long
submerged in motionless water, and of that pallid hue. Her eyes, lost in
the fatty ridges of her face, looked like two small pieces of coal pressed
into a lump of dough as they moved from one face to another while the
visitors stated their errand.
She did not ask them to sit. She just stood in the door and listened
quietly until the spokesman came to a stumbling halt. Then they could
hear the invisible watch ticking at the end of the gold chain.
Her voice was dry and cold. "I have no taxes in Jefferson. Colonel Sartoris
explained it to me. Perhaps one of you can gain access to the city records
and satisfy yourselves."
"But we have. We are the city authorities, Miss Emily. Didn't you get a
notice from the sheriff, signed by him?"
"I received a paper, yes," Miss Emily said. "Perhaps he considers himself
the sheriff . . . I have no taxes in Jefferson."
"But there is nothing on the books to show that, you see We must go by
the--"
"See Colonel Sartoris. I have no taxes in Jefferson."
"But, Miss Emily--"

"See Colonel Sartoris." (Colonel Sartoris had been dead almost ten years.)
"I have no taxes in Jefferson. Tobe!" The Negro appeared. "Show these
gentlemen out."

II
So SHE vanquished them, horse and foot, just as she had vanquished
their fathers thirty years before about the smell.
That was two years after her father's death and a short time after her
sweetheart--the one we believed would marry her --had deserted her.
After her father's death she went out very little; after her sweetheart went
away, people hardly saw her at all. A few of the ladies had the temerity to
call, but were not received, and the only sign of life about the place was
the Negro man--a young man then--going in and out with a market
basket.
"Just as if a man--any man--could keep a kitchen properly, "the ladies
said; so they were not surprised when the smell developed. It was another
link between the gross, teeming world and the high and mighty
Griersons.
A neighbor, a woman, complained to the mayor, Judge Stevens, eighty
years old.
"But what will you have me do about it, madam?" he said.
"Why, send her word to stop it," the woman said. "Isn't there a law? "
"I'm sure that won't be necessary," Judge Stevens said. "It's probably just a
snake or a rat that nigger of hers killed in the yard. I'll speak to him about
it."
The next day he received two more complaints, one from a man who
came in diffident deprecation. "We really must do something about it,
Judge. I'd be the last one in the world to bother Miss Emily, but we've got
to do something." That night the Board of Aldermen met--three
graybeards and one younger man, a member of the rising generation.
"It's simple enough," he said. "Send her word to have her place cleaned
up. Give her a certain time to do it in, and if she don't. .."
"Dammit, sir," Judge Stevens said, "will you accuse a lady to her face of
smelling bad?"

So the next night, after midnight, four men crossed Miss Emily's lawn and
slunk about the house like burglars, sniffing along the base of the
brickwork and at the cellar openings while one of them performed a
regular sowing motion with his hand out of a sack slung from his
shoulder. They broke open the cellar door and sprinkled lime there, and
in all the outbuildings. As they recrossed the lawn, a window that had
been dark was lighted and Miss Emily sat in it, the light behind her, and
her upright torso motionless as that of an idol. They crept quietly across
the lawn and into the shadow of the locusts that lined the street. After a
week or two the smell went away.
That was when people had begun to feel really sorry for her. People in
our town, remembering how old lady Wyatt, her great-aunt, had gone
completely crazy at last, believed that the Griersons held themselves a
little too high for what they really were. None of the young men were
quite good enough for Miss Emily and such. We had long thought of them
as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her
father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and
clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front
door. So when she got to be thirty and was still single, we were not
pleased exactly, but vindicated; even with insanity in the family she
wouldn't have turned down all of her chances if they had really
materialized.
When her father died, it got about that the house was all that was left to
her; and in a way, people were glad. At last they could pity Miss Emily.
Being left alone, and a pauper, she had become humanized. Now she too
would know the old thrill and the old despair of a penny more or less.
The day after his death all the ladies prepared to call at the house and
offer condolence and aid, as is our custom Miss Emily met them at the
door, dressed as usual and with no trace of grief on her face. She told
them that her father was not dead. She did that for three days, with the
ministers calling on her, and the doctors, trying to persuade her to let
them dispose of the body. Just as they were about to resort to law and
force, she broke down, and they buried her father quickly.
We did not say she was crazy then. We believed she had to do that. We
remembered all the young men her father had driven away, and we knew
that with nothing left, she would have to cling to that which had robbed
her, as people will.

III
SHE WAS SICK for a long time. When we saw her again, her hair was cut
short, making her look like a girl, with a vague resemblance to those
angels in colored church windows--sort of tragic and serene.
The town had just let the contracts for paving the sidewalks, and in the
summer after her father's death they began the work. The construction
company came with riggers and mules and machinery, and a foreman
named Homer Barron, a Yankee--a big, dark, ready man, with a big voice
and eyes lighter than his face. The little boys would follow in groups to
hear him cuss the riggers, and the riggers singing in time to the rise and
fall of picks. Pretty soon he knew everybody in town. Whenever you heard
a lot of laughing anywhere about the square, Homer Barron would be in
the center of the group. Presently we began to see him and Miss Emily on
Sunday afternoons driving in the yellow-wheeled buggy and the matched
team of bays from the livery stable.
At first we were glad that Miss Emily would have an interest, because the
ladies all said, "Of course a Grierson would not think seriously of a
Northerner, a day laborer." But there were still others, older people, who
said that even grief could not cause a real lady to forget noblesse obligewithout calling it noblesse oblige. They just said, "Poor Emily. Her
kinsfolk should come to her." She had some kin in Alabama; but years
ago her father had fallen out with them over the estate of old lady Wyatt,
the crazy woman, and there was no communication between the two
families. They had not even been represented at the funeral.
And as soon as the old people said, "Poor Emily," the whispering began.
"Do you suppose it's really so?" they said to one another. "Of course it is.
What else could . . ." This behind their hands; rustling of craned silk and
satin behind jalousies closed upon the sun of Sunday afternoon as the
thin, swift clop-clop-clop of the matched team passed: "Poor Emily."
She carried her head high enough--even when we believed that she was
fallen. It was as if she demanded more than ever the recognition of her
dignity as the last Grierson; as if it had wanted that touch of earthiness to
reaffirm her imperviousness. Like when she bought the rat poison, the
arsenic. That was over a year after they had begun to say "Poor Emily,"
and while the two female cousins were visiting her.
"I want some poison," she said to the druggist. She was over thirty then,
still a slight woman, though thinner than usual, with cold, haughty black

eyes in a face the flesh of which was strained across the temples and
about the eyesockets as you imagine a lighthouse-keeper's face ought to
look. "I want some poison," she said.
"Yes, Miss Emily. What kind? For rats and such? I'd recom--"
"I want the best you have. I don't care what kind."
The druggist named several. "They'll kill anything up to an elephant. But
what you want is--"
"Arsenic," Miss Emily said. "Is that a good one?"
"Is . . . arsenic? Yes, ma'am. But what you want--"
"I want arsenic."
The druggist looked down at her. She looked back at him, erect, her face
like a strained flag. "Why, of course," the druggist said. "If that's what you
want. But the law requires you to tell what you are going to use it for."
Miss Emily just stared at him, her head tilted back in order to look him
eye for eye, until he looked away and went and got the arsenic and
wrapped it up. The Negro delivery boy brought her the package; the
druggist didn't come back. When she opened the package at home there
was written on the box, under the skull and bones: "For rats."

IV
So THE NEXT day we all said, "She will kill herself"; and we said it would
be the best thing. When she had first begun to be seen with Homer
Barron, we had said, "She will marry him." Then we said, "She will
persuade him yet," because Homer himself had remarked--he liked men,
and it was known that he drank with the younger men in the Elks' Club-that he was not a marrying man. Later we said, "Poor Emily" behind the
jalousies as they passed on Sunday afternoon in the glittering buggy,
Miss Emily with her head high and Homer Barron with his hat cocked and
a cigar in his teeth, reins and whip in a yellow glove.
Then some of the ladies began to say that it was a disgrace to the town
and a bad example to the young people. The men did not want to
interfere, but at last the ladies forced the Baptist minister--Miss Emily's
people were Episcopal-- to call upon her. He would never divulge what
happened during that interview, but he refused to go back again. The

next Sunday they again drove about the streets, and the following day the
minister's wife wrote to Miss Emily's relations in Alabama.
So she had blood-kin under her roof again and we sat back to watch
developments. At first nothing happened. Then we were sure that they
were to be married. We learned that Miss Emily had been to the jeweler's
and ordered a man's toilet set in silver, with the letters H. B. on each
piece. Two days later we learned that she had bought a complete outfit of
men's clothing, including a nightshirt, and we said, "They are married."
We were really glad. We were glad because the two female cousins were
even more Grierson than Miss Emily had ever been.
So we were not surprised when Homer Barron--the streets had been
finished some time since--was gone. We were a little disappointed that
there was not a public blowing-off, but we believed that he had gone on
to prepare for Miss Emily's coming, or to give her a chance to get rid of
the cousins. (By that time it was a cabal, and we were all Miss Emily's
allies to help circumvent the cousins.) Sure enough, after another week
they departed. And, as we had expected all along, within three days
Homer Barron was back in town. A neighbor saw the Negro man admit
him at the kitchen door at dusk one evening.
And that was the last we saw of Homer Barron. And of Miss Emily for
some time. The Negro man went in and out with the market basket, but
the front door remained closed. Now and then we would see her at a
window for a moment, as the men did that night when they sprinkled the
lime, but for almost six months she did not appear on the streets. Then
we knew that this was to be expected too; as if that quality of her father
which had thwarted her woman's life so many times had been too virulent
and too furious to die.
When we next saw Miss Emily, she had grown fat and her hair was turning
gray. During the next few years it grew grayer and grayer until it attained
an even pepper-and-salt iron-gray, when it ceased turning. Up to the day
of her death at seventy-four it was still that vigorous iron-gray, like the
hair of an active man.
From that time on her front door remained closed, save for a period of
six or seven years, when she was about forty, during which she gave
lessons in china-painting. She fitted up a studio in one of the downstairs
rooms, where the daughters and granddaughters of Colonel Sartoris'
contemporaries were sent to her with the same regularity and in the same
spirit that they were sent to church on Sundays with a twenty-five-cent
piece for the collection plate. Meanwhile her taxes had been remitted.

Then the newer generation became the backbone and the spirit of the
town, and the painting pupils grew up and fell away and did not send
their children to her with boxes of color and tedious brushes and pictures
cut from the ladies' magazines. The front door closed upon the last one
and remained closed for good. When the town got free postal delivery,
Miss Emily alone refused to let them fasten the metal numbers above her
door and attach a mailbox to it. She would not listen to them.
Daily, monthly, yearly we watched the Negro grow grayer and more
stooped, going in and out with the market basket. Each December we
sent her a tax notice, which would be returned by the post office a week
later, unclaimed. Now and then we would see her in one of the
downstairs windows--she had evidently shut up the top floor of the
house--like the carven torso of an idol in a niche, looking or not looking
at us, we could never tell which. Thus she passed from generation to
generation--dear, inescapable, impervious, tranquil, and perverse.
And so she died. Fell ill in the house filled with dust and shadows, with
only a doddering Negro man to wait on her. We did not even know she
was sick; we had long since given up trying to get any information from
the Negro
He talked to no one, probably not even to her, for his voice had grown
harsh and rusty, as if from disuse.
She died in one of the downstairs rooms, in a heavy walnut bed with a
curtain, her gray head propped on a pillow yellow and moldy with age
and lack of sunlight.

V
THE NEGRO met the first of the ladies at the front door and let them in,
with their hushed, sibilant voices and their quick, curious glances, and
then he disappeared. He walked right through the house and out the back
and was not seen again.
The two female cousins came at once. They held the funeral on the
second day, with the town coming to look at Miss Emily beneath a mass
of bought flowers, with the crayon face of her father musing profoundly
above the bier and the ladies sibilant and macabre; and the very old men
--some in their brushed Confederate uniforms--on the porch and the
lawn, talking of Miss Emily as if she had been a contemporary of theirs,
believing that they had danced with her and courted her perhaps,
confusing time with its mathematical progression, as the old do, to whom
all the past is not a diminishing road but, instead, a huge meadow which

no winter ever quite touches, divided from them now by the narrow
bottle-neck of the most recent decade of years.
Already we knew that there was one room in that region above stairs
which no one had seen in forty years, and which would have to be forced.
They waited until Miss Emily was decently in the ground before they
opened it.
The violence of breaking down the door seemed to fill this room with
pervading dust. A thin, acrid pall as of the tomb seemed to lie everywhere
upon this room decked and furnished as for a bridal: upon the valance
curtains of faded rose color, upon the rose-shaded lights, upon the
dressing table, upon the delicate array of crystal and the man's toilet
things backed with tarnished silver, silver so tarnished that the
monogram was obscured. Among them lay a collar and tie, as if they had
just been removed, which, lifted, left upon the surface a pale crescent in
the dust. Upon a chair hung the suit, carefully folded; beneath it the two
mute shoes and the discarded socks.
The man himself lay in the bed.
For a long while we just stood there, looking down at the profound and
fleshless grin. The body had apparently once lain in the attitude of an
embrace, but now the long sleep that outlasts love, that conquers even
the grimace of love, had cuckolded him. What was left of him, rotted
beneath what was left of the nightshirt, had become inextricable from the
bed in which he lay; and upon him and upon the pillow beside him lay
that even coating of the patient and biding dust.
Then we noticed that in the second pillow was the indentation of a head.
One of us lifted something from it, and leaning forward, that faint and
invisible dust dry and acrid in the nostrils, we saw a long strand of irongray hair.
