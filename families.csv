""Judge Benbow"" - he is given no other name - is the executor of Goodhue Coldfield's estate.  He also looks out for Rosa Coldfield after the Civil War, and in return she cites him along with Quentin Compson's grandfather as a paragon of breeding and deportment (35).  Chronologically the Judge could be the father of Francis Benbow, who was mentioned in <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, but in this novel his son - the books' only other Benbow - is named Percy.</p>

"19663","<a href=""/content/benbowsinfd"">BenbowsInFD</a>","<a href=""/content/benbowfamily"">BenbowFamily</a>","<p>In <em>Flags in the Dust</em> ""family"" is largely a way to define class.  If Faulkner's first Yoknapatawpha fiction depicts the Sartorises as the county's closest thing to a hereditary nobility, Narcissa Benbow's family pedigree identifies her as a kind of town princess.  The family home she and her older brother Horace live in was designed three generations earlier by an English architect, and features ""mullioned casements brought out from England"" (164).  When readers first meet her on the novel's first day, she is the one lady at Belle Mitchell's party to whom Miss Jenny Sartoris du Pre offers a ride in <em>her</em> family's horse-drawn carriage (29).  The idea that a Snopes could aspire to Narcissa's hand is treated as perverse, a symptom of modernity as chaos, but even the attentions of the middle-class Dr. Alford are depicted as a form of presumption; of course a Benbow should marry a Sartoris, and Narcissa does.  When her new husband dies, she and her infant son are left in possession of the Sartoris plantation.</p>
<p>Two earlier generations of Benbows are briefly referred to, and Horace's adult career as a lawyer is described as another kind of inheritance.  But the only family relationship that the novel develops is the sibling one between Narcissa and Horace.  With them Faulkner also explores ""family"" psychologically, anticipating a thematic emphasis he will develop much more fully in his next two Yoknapatawpha fictions, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (1929) and <em>As I Lay Dying</em> (1930).  ""Horry"" and ""Narcy"" - as they call each other, sometimes with too much affection and sometimes with an anguish that seems over-determined - are pulled together and apart by his sexual desires (which betray him into a sordid relationship with the married Belle, whom he marries at the end) and Narcissa's incompletely sublimated sexual repressions.  The relationship between aristocratic exclusivity and incest, fastidiousness and transgression, is another familiar literary and cultural motif, though it's not clear how deliberately Faulkner is deploying it to challenge, or even complicate his class allegiances elsewhere in the novel.</p>

The General's son, referred to only as Father, becomes the novel's dominant voice as he passes what the General told him about the Sutpens, along with his own commentary, on to his son Quentin.

What Mr. Compson says to Quentin about incest, for instance, may remind readers of the earlier novel of Quentin's relationship with his sister, but this novel's emphasis is unmistakenly cultural rather than Freudian.  As in the earlier short stories ""That Evening Sun"" and ""A Justice,"" Quentin is exposed to a new realm of experience, only here that experience is not found in a Negro cabin or an Indian village but on a plantation that is still grander than the Compson estate.  The novel maintains a sense of the class difference between the older Compson family and the parvenu Sutpens; ""your grandfather or Judge Benbow,"" Father tells Quentin, would have enacted the role of gentleman ""more effortlessly"" (35).  But that distance cannot shelter Quentin from the anguished sense that ""<em>maybe it took . . . Thomas Sutpen to make all of us</em>"" (210).

His commentaries often change details from the novel - for example, here Benjy is castrated after Mr. Compson's death - but it's hard to say whether these discrepancies are deliberate or examples of Faulkner's carelessness with facts.  The ""Appendix"" is organized as a series of separate entries on individual characters, a technique that de-emphasizes the relationships <em>among</em> the family members which is a major source of the original novel's power.  Instead, the ""Appendix"" firmly locates the story of the family in the history of the nation and the region, from the Indian Removal of the 19th century to World War II - Caddy is last sighted among the Nazis in occupied France, for example, and Jason's final disposition of ""the Compson domain"" (329) occurs as part of the post-War housing boom.  The ""Appendix"" is dominated by words like ""dispossessed"" (325) and ""doomed"" (330) and ""lost"" (341) but the fate of the Compson family is not given the tragic status it has in the novel; while in that text Quentin evokes his Grandfather the General as a heroic figure from a great past, for instance, the ""Appendix"" says of him that he ""failed at Shiloh in '62 and failed again though not so badly at Resaca in '64"" (329).  It is worth noting, too, that while the Compson family tree remains all white (unlike the Sartorises and the McCaslins), the ""Appendix Compson"" includes Ikkemotubbe, and four members of the Gibson family - though these last entries appear after a kind of disclaimer: ""These others were not Compsons.

The stream-of-consciousness narrative technique used in the first three sections of this novel vividly dramatizes the extent to which one's earlier life is always present, consciously or unconsciously.  Throughout his section the 33-year-old Benjy Compson helplessly re-lives his childhood memories, when his beloved sister Caddy was ""here"" (3).  His brother Quentin, knowing how painful are his own recollections of Caddy, spends his last day in Massachusetts - or anywhere - trying in vain to repress the return of memories that keep carrying him back to home and family.  Their brother Jason is much less mindful of the past, seeming to live in the present, but his actions - following his niece around as twenty years earlier his mother had commissioned him to follow his sister, embezzling and locking up and constantly counting the money that is his attempt to compensate for the job in the bank that he lost twenty years ago, before he ever had it - drives home just as powerfully the way the children of Jason and Caroline Bascomb Compson are defined by what ""family"" as a destructive force did to them.  All the ""father said""s in Quentin's section reveal how his mind is inhabited by that parent, but perhaps the saddest line in his section - it is repeated twice - is Quentin's ""<em>if I'd just had a mother so I could say Mother Mother</em>"" (95, 172).  The Compson family as a whole is certainly shaped by history, by the defeat of the Confederacy and the collapse of the old Southern aristocracy, and the past that provides the context for the novel's final, Easter section is the modern idea of the death of God, where the Christian faith of the ""breddren en sistuhn"" in the black church (295) is juxtaposed with the nihilistic darkness in which the Compson children find themselves.  But although Faulkner said he never read Freud, the novel is one of literature's greatest representations of what Freud called, not without irony of his own, the family romance.<br />
Our tree does not try to identify the father of Caddy's daughter Quentin, who represents the last of the Compsons.  Some commentators assume it is Dalton Ames, the man to whom Caddy loses her virginity, but when the pregnant Caddy replies to her brother Quentin's question about her sexual history - ""Have there been very many Caddy"" - she says ""I dont know too many"" (115).</p>

The Gibson family we see in this text still goes back no further than Dilsey, but it now includes an unnamed husband for Frony (though this does not clear up the question about Luster's father), and gives us a look at the Gibsons beyond Yoknapatawpha: after first moving to St. Louis to be with her husband, Frony now lives in Memphis where she takes care of Dilsey; and like Versh in the earlier novel, TP (as Faulkner here spells T.P.) now lives in Memphis too.  (Curiously, Versh is the only one of Dilsey's children not mentioned in the ""Appendix."")  It is surely significant that the Gibson family has apparently all left Yoknapatawpha.  But even in ""the Negro residence section of Memphis"" (336), they are still mainly defined in terms of the Compson story.  Although it might be interesting to know why Dilsey's family has migrated to Memphis, it is a current event in Caddy's life that takes the narrative there.

The Compsons: a mother who fancies herself a Christian, a father who dies, three sons (the oldest of whom leaves Yoknapatawpha for Massachusetts), one daughter and her child.  The Gibsons: a mother who is a Christian, a father who dies, two sons (the older of whom leaves Yoknapatawpha for Memphis), one daughter and her child.  In neither instance is the father of the child identified, and both children live with their grandmothers.  Dilsey is Faulkner's first major black character, and Gibsons appear in over one-third of the novel's 463 Events (as we have defined Events), though this is mainly because so much of it is set at Compson place, where Dilsey does all the cooking and other housework and where her sons and grandson work as Benjy's caretakers.  Dilsey herself plays such a large and impressive part in the novel's last section that many critics refer to it as 'Dilsey's section'; when narrative goes with her, Frony, Luster and Benjy to the Easter service in Jefferson's African American church, it locates the Gibsons in their own context as blacks living in the modern South.  But the narrative never really gives Dilsey or her family parity with the Compsons.  Even in that last section, what happens to Dilsey in church is made most significant as an ironic contrast to what happens to Jason Compson in the section's other main narrative, when ""from time to time he passes churches"" on his drive to Mottston in his frantic, futile quest to recover the money his niece took (306).  Individual members of the Gibson family acquire a powerful individuality, especially the tough-minded Frony, who even as a child knows that when Caddy climbs the tree expecting to see a ""party,"" what awaits her is really a ""funeral"" (36) - and that if it rains on Easter, she and her new dress will ""git wet"" (290).  As Frony repeats, ""I knows what I knows"" (36, 38, 39). There are even a few scenes that take place in Dilsey's cabin, though they are described as they recur in Benjy's memory, and what he remembers most vividly is the ""smell"" of this black residence (28).  In other words, this African American family is still defined almost entirely in terms of the story the novel is really interested in, the story of the white family that the blacks serve for generations.</p>

They are linked through what could be considered a third, non-biological but recognizably familial relationship between Sam Fathers and Ike McCaslin, who commune across racial, cultural and generational lines that seem almost to disappear in the wilderness.  The novel's treatment of Sam's Indian family as a family is much less resonant.  It adds a new and potentially moving note of pathos to the story Faulkner has so often told before about Ikkemotubbe's rise to power when it provides his cousin, Moketubbe, with an eight-year-old son who is almost certainly killed by Ikkemotubbe; there is no mention of a parent's grief or any other human feeling, however, in its brief report of either the event or Moketubbe's subsequent ""abdication"" (158).  And a new inconsistency appears in the family's genealogy: when the Chickasaw chief Issetibbeha is first mentioned, in ""The Old People"" chapter, he is identified by the narrator as the ""uncle"" of Ikkemotubbe (157), but when talking with his cousin in ""The Bear"" chapter, Ike refers to ""Ikkemotubbe's father old Issetibbeha"" (245).  There is no textual reason to attribute the lapse to Ike rather than Faulkner.  (Our graph represents him as an uncle, the place he occupies in all but one of the other texts.)  Yet the novel's description of Sam's enslaved mother not as a ""Negro"" but as a ""quadroon"" (157) - that is, someone with three white and one black grandparents - connects the story of Sam's family in new ways to the recurring wrongs of Southern history, and makes his own body the tragic scene of the conflict that remains unresolved whether he lives as a ""Negro"" in society or an ""Indian"" in the woods.  Ike tells his cousin that ""Sam Fathers set me free"" (285), but Sam himself has no similar opportunity to renounce his lost patrimony - or his inheritance from his mother.</p>

However, the story also creates real confusion about Sam's place in the family's generational sequence.  Ikkemotubbe-Doom is still the central figure from the past, still the ruthless plotter who becomes the chief by killing his cousin Moketubbe, who had inherited the title in the customary way.  Ikkemotubbe buys a slave in New Orleans whom he takes as a concubine; she is already pregnant when he brings her back to the plantation, where he compels her to marry ""one of the slaves which he had just inherited"" as the new chief (203).  The child this enslaved woman bears is named ""Had-Two-Fathers,"" which was the name Sam himself was given at birth in ""A Justice"" and still bears in ""The Old People"" under his anglicized name of Sam Fathers.  But while the story strongly implies that Ikkemotubbe is Sam's father, it calls Ikkemotubbe his ""grandfather,"" and says Sam has ""been a Negro for two generations"" (202) - in which case there is an earlier ""Had-Two-Fathers"" who is presumably the ""own son"" whom Ikkemotubbe sells to a white family along with his concubine and her enslaved husband, and who would then also Sam's one father (203).  Our genealogical chart includes this ""Had-Two-Fathers,"" Sr., but with no certainty that Faulkner really intended him to be there.  The most likely explanation for these confusions is that Faulkner lost track of the relationships in the course of drafting and rewriting the story.  He clears it up when he revises ""The Old People"" for publication in <em>Go Down, Moses</em> (1942): there Ikkemotubbe is Sam's father, the enslaved woman his mother, and the 'step-father' she marries the reason for Sam's name.  In a sense the confusion is a symptom of Faulkner's lack of investment in these Indians and blacks and mixed-race characters as members of a family, though his imagination repeatedly returns to the figure of Ikkemotubbe-as-Doom and Sam is one of the most memorable characters in his canon.

It also describes in some detail Issetibbeha's anxiety about his son, Moketubbe, who covets the ""pair of slippers with red heels"" that Issetibbeha brought back with him from a trip to Europe.  The slipper is the one place where the story provides access inside the dynamic of the Indian family.  For a while his son's behavior amuses Issetibbeha, but remembering Doom's rise to power, he grows increasingly anxious at what it portends for his future.  The role Moketubbe actually plays in his father's death is not made explicit, but the evidence implies another regicide.  The role that race plays in the tale is ambiguous.  Moketubbe may have murdered his father, but the story leaves no doubt about his unfitness to be the Man.

Having signed the final cession papers with ""her X,"" wearing a French silk dress ""and a hat crowned with the royal-colored plume of a queen,"" amid her Negro slaves and ""the young men of her body guard,"" it is she who tells the tribe to ""Turn the mules west,"" and who leads them from ""home"" (170-71).  The youngest generation of the family - her grandchildren, including the granddaughter who marries a white man - is also identified with her, not her son.  It is still the case, however, that the narrative shows no interest in her family as a family; the relationships are genealogical, but not emotional.</p>

Sixty years later he remains an unreconstructed Confederate and a cultural link to the Old South.  The fact that his father gave him a mule when he married his first wife establishes the family's lower class origins, but he and his six sons are friends and hunting companions with the aristocratic Sartorises, which establishes the difference between this family of yeomen and ""poor white"" Southerners like the Snopeses.  Virginius has had two wives; both are now dead.  His adult sons continue to live at the family home in the woods and hills, where they remain connected to a traditional natural world that seems outside the disruptive modern forces that are at work closer to town.

There are, however, a few subtle suggestions that this traditional world is itself endangered: the effeminacy of son Henry, the childlessness of the all the sons, and in particular the odd breeding experiment being conducted by son Jackson, who mates a fox and a hound with grotesque results.</p>

In brief, the process begins when in the novel's first 'chapter,' the previously unpublished ""Was,"" he gives Buck and Buddy a new brother, a slave named Tomey's Turl who is described as a ""white half-McCaslin"" (7).  It is developed in the extensive additions he makes to the previously written material about Lucas Beauchamp, who now shares a common ancestor (Carothers McCaslin) with his various Edmonds landlords.  It concludes with a revision of ""Delta Autumn,"" where the last McCaslin and the last Edmonds are brought together with one of the last members of the Beauchamp family, and Carother McCaslins'  'original sin' as a slave owner is repeated on the eve of World War II.  In the long chapter called ""The Bear,"" it is Ike McCaslin who plumbs the true darkness at the heart of the family's history.  As a sixteen-year-old he is hunting in the ledgers of the plantation that he will inherit as Old Carothers' grandson, innocently hoping to learn more about the history of ""his own flesh and blood"" (254), when he discovers the terrible truth about his heritage that results in his principled renunciation of the estate.  Like <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>, this novel uses a family to represent the larger history of a culture.

Members from five generations and from all three of the family's branches - McCaslin, Edmonds and Beauchamp - are included in <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, but the larger family story, as told in <em>Moses</em>, is significantly revised, a process that will continue in subsequent texts.  Old Carothers McCaslin, the long-dead patriarch of the family, is described as Carothers (Roth) Edmonds' ""great-grandfather"" (7); in <em>Moses</em> he is Roth's great-great-grandfather.  But the most striking change involves the lineage of the Beauchamps, Old Carothers' illegitimate, mixed-race descendants.   Lucas Beauchamp, the black man at the center of the novel's detective plot, is identified as the ""son of one of old of Old Carothers McCaslin's . . . slaves"" (7).  In <em>Moses</em> Lucas is Old Carother's grandson - but also his great-grandson.  His father is the product of incest, of the sexual relationship between a white slave-owner and his daughter.  Neither that daughter, Tomasina, nor her mother Eunice - the two enslaved woman with whom Old Carothers had a child - are mentioned in <em>Intruder</em>; their place on the family tree is occupied instead by the unnamed male (Tomey's Turl in <em>Moses</em>) who is Lucas' father.   In <em>Moses</em> discovering that his grandfather committed incest with a slave who was his own, owned daughter is the symbolic and human horror that leads Ike McCaslin to renounce his family inheritance.  Ike is ""still alive at ninety"" in <em>Intruder</em> (91), but this novel's one mention of him refers to him only as one of ""the hunters"" who used to hunt bear in Yoknapatawpha in ""the old days"" (90).  Like <em>Moses</em>, <em>Intruder in the Dust</em> is about the legacy of slavery, in this case the virulent doctrine of racial superiority that makes it seem certain that (white) Yoknapatawpha will lynch Lucas for having apparently killed a (white) man.  And Lucas himself remains a commanding figure, one of the most impressive African American characters in the canon.  But when Lucas says ""I am a McCaslin,"" it is a boast (19).  The novel's various associations of him with grandfathers - his own, or Chick Mallison's, also a white patriarch - imply that those old southern aristocrats are a source of pride, not moral consternation.  If Faulkner's use of the McCaslin genealogy in <em>Moses</em> to look hard and deeply into an American heart of darkness is one of the great achievements of his career, it is disappointing to note how his return to the family in <em>Intruder</em> seems to retreat from or at least palliate that revelation.</p>

This recalls the truth that had appalled Ike in <em>Go Down, Moses</em>, but is in fact a revision of that story: the slave here is a different woman than Eunice, and the particular horror of Old Carothers fathering a second child on his own enslaved daughter Tomey has disappeared.  The product of this interracial relationship is not Tomey's Turl, but Ned McCaslin.  Ned is one of the novel's three major characters, but in a comic role that enables the narrative to revisit the past nostalgically.  Ned is a new member of the family.  Even more interestingly, in this final Yoknapatawpha fiction, Faulkner extends the McCaslins onto an entirely new branch of the family tree, the Priests.  It seems significant that this new line originates with the marriage between an Edmonds and a man named <em>Lucius</em> Priest, who is actually ""a distant kinsman"" of Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin (279).  On the one hand, the idea of sex between kinfolks recalls, even as it renders harmless the incest in the McCaslin past in the past of Faulkner's fiction.

The stories are narrated by the Bayard who appeared in the first Yoknapatawpha fiction, <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, as an old man struggling with modernity, deafness and a weak heart.  In these eight stories he grows from a twelve-year-old boy to a young man through a set of losses, including the defeat of the South and two deaths in the family, and in the process discovers the human failings of the father he begins by idolizing.  Faulkner may have been led back to Colonel Sartoris, as seen through the eyes of his child, by a desire to restore some of the shine to the idea of the aristocratic planter, an idea which he himself was tarnishing by writing about ""Colonel Sutpen"" in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> at the same time he wrote the first seven of these Bayard stories.<br />
In addition to the Sartorises, father and son, two other characters recur throughout the stories.  Beginning with ""Ambuscade,"" Faulkner introduces a new member of the extended Sartoris family - Rosa Millard, Colonel John's mother-in-law whom Bayard calls Granny.  She maintains the plantation and nurtures Bayard in the absence of his father.  These three characters - Rosa, the Colonel and Bayard - are, with one slight exception, the only Sartorises who appear in the series.  On the other hand, the only other character who appears with Bayard in all eight stories, an enslaved child Bayard's age named Ringo, may be an unacknowledged member of the family.  Not until Faulkner collected the first seven stories into the novel <em>The Unvanquished</em> (1838) did he explicitly give Ringo a father.  There are details in the stories - including the fact that he too calls Rosa ""Granny"" - which may suggest Faulkner considered making Ringo the illegitimate offspring of the Colonel and a female slave.  But if he's considering that idea, even unconsciously, he never lets it come to the surface of the narratives, and so we include Ringo on the Strother family tree.</p>

That is a good reminder of the status ""Sartoris"" has in the collective Yoknapatawpha mind.  What Faulkner intended by linking the aristocratic Sartorises whom he celebrated with the poor white Snopeses whom, as a quasi-species, he execrated, is a good question to ponder.

Falkner's statue (in Ripley, Mississippi) is at least as grand as the marble representation of Colonel John Sartoris that looms over both the town cemetery and the lives of his descendants.  Like Colonel John, Colonel William was a plantation aristocrat, a Confederate officer demoted by his regiment, a railroad builder shot by a former partner - and also, in a part of his biography his great-grandson leaves out of his fictional recreation, a best-selling novelist.  It is safe to say that of all Yoknapatawpha's recurring families, the Sartorises were the ones that Faulkner himself was most personally invested in; as is the case for the younger Sartorises, working out the terms of his relationship to the memory of the Colonel was not easy, psychologically or morally, which partly explains why Colonel Sartoris appears so frequently in his texts.  On the first page of this novel he is both long gone, and ""a far more palpable presence"" then either of the two living men in the scene (3).</p>
<p>As a Lost Generation writer, however, Faulkner uses the Sartoris family in this novel chiefly to represent the greatness of the Southern past and the bleakness of the modern present.  That so many Sartoris men are named either John or Bayard simultaneously binds the past and present together, and drives home the idea that, if the names endure, so much else has been lost - especially in the two wars that frame the story: the Civil War, where the first Bayard was killed, and the Great War (as World War I was originally called, apparently without any ironic intent), where the last John died.  Altogether twenty Sartorises appear in the text.  Curiously, it has the least to say about the generation that Faulkner's parents belonged to, the first generation born after the South's surrender.  Nor do any of the later texts tell their story.   By the end of the novel all the adult Sartoris males are dead.  At the end of the novel, on the other hand, the last Bayard's widow gives birth to a son, whom she names in a way that tries to exorcise the family's ""ghosts of glamourous and old disastrous things"" and provide some kind of future (403).  Faulkner will go on to write more than two dozen stories and novels with Sartorises in them, but as one might expect, his imagination will have trouble imagining <em>that</em>.</p>

Actually, in this novel they're a bit different than they are in earlier texts.  Bayard II is never referred to except as ""Colonel Sartoris,"" but Faulkner had already used the same convention in <em>The Town</em> (in this novel he adds a new phrase, referring to Bayard's father John as ""the original Colonel Sartoris,"" 446).  The significant differences involve the family history, and especially the tone with which it is narrated.  ""Mrs Du Pre,"" for example, is credited with deliberately arranging Bayard III's marriage to Narcissa Benbow.  ""Colonel Sartoris"" (i.e. Bayard II) figures mainly as the original founder and president of the bank that Flem Snopes takes over, but the tone with which his death is described is surprisingly sarcastic - he ""lets his grandson run the automobile off into a ditch"" (150).  The most striking difference, however, concerns the treatment of Bayard III.  In the several representations of him and his twin brother John in World War I, there is no hint of the way he was earlier characterized as a tragic member of of the Lost Generation (see <em>Flags in the Dust</em>, for example).  Instead, in a somewhat lengthy passage in the middle of this novel, Charles recounts what his uncle Gavin and his mother each say about Bayard: Gavin, that his problem was ""boredom"" (210), and Maggie, that he was afraid of his own weakness, ""that completely un-Sartoris-like capacity for shame "" (211).  The passage includes an interesting analysis of Bayard's place in the family as a twin, but as Faulkner's final words on the person to whom Mrs. Du Pre refers as ""the last Sartoris Mohican"" (210), it implicitly renounces the idea of the family's romantic doom.</p>

His father, Colonel John, appears several times, but the Sartoris men are both overshadowed by John's mother-in-law, Rosa, who not only runs the plantation while John at war, but gives orders to a Confederate General - though the field on which she fights is marital rather than martial.  John and Bayard are the most frequently recurring characters in the fictions (the father appears or is metioned in 22 texts; his son in 18).  Rosa appears or is mentioned in 10.  But this story also mentions John's mother and his first wife, who never appear in the fictions directly and are only mentioned (though never named) in 3 and 4, respectively.  The references to them here don't add any new facts about them as people, or about their role in the family; instead, the story's use of them can be called artifactual - John's ""Carolina"" mother is represented by a medallion (670) and his wife (Bayard's ""Mother,"" 698) by the wedding dress that her mother and she each wore before it is worn a third time by a cousin at the story's end.  The story is both a romance, and a send-up of romances with ""ladies looking out windows and playing on something [like dulcimers] while somebody else was off somewhere fighting"" (695), and the comedy depends upon juxtaposing war with the genteel repression of life's grittier elements, like 'backhouses' - i.e. privies.

Rosa and Bayard now live in a slave cabin - Yankees destroyed the big house in an earlier story - but the color line remains in place; although Bayard notes that Ringo ""had got to treating me like Granny [i.e. Rosa] did,"" there is still no suggestion that the two growing boys might be related (78), and in church Ringo sits with the other blacks in the ""slave gallery"" until Granny calls him down to help distribute the profits from her campaign (84).</p>

But if money was a material motive for transforming the Bayard who appeared in <em>Flags in the Dust</em> as an old man into the adolescent maturing through the cultural traumas of the Civil War and Reconstruction, both the textual and biographical evidence suggests that Faulkner may also have brought the Sartorises back to the center of his fiction as a way to burnish the image of the plantation aristocrat.  The relationship between the two ""colonels"" - Sartoris and Sutpen - is made more overt in the revisions Faulkner made in the stories.  Already in the <em>Post</em> version of ""Retreat,"" Uncle Buck McCaslin celebrates Colonel John's heroism at the expense of the unnamed ""damn whippersnapper"" who replaces him in command of the Confederate regiment from Jefferson.  But in the final story in the novel, ""An Odor of Verbena,"" published for the first time in this novel, the newest member of the Sartoris family - Drusilla, whose marriage to John is the narrative focus of the penultimate story, ""Skirmish at Sartoris"" - develops at length the contrast between Sutpen's ruthless ambitions and John's noble ""dream"" (223).  </p>
<p>The decision to let Bayard narrate the stories from a dual vantage point - the boy, to whom ""the things [his father] did . . . made him seem big to us"" (9), and the older man, who in some respects ""knows better now"" (10) - keeps the novel's portrait of the planter class from becoming too simple.  In that last story, Bayard becomes ""The Sartoris"" (214) in part by revising the aristocratic code by which the Colonel lived.  But in the end, Bayard joins Drusilla in building a monument to the first Sartoris: ""he would always be there,"" the ""dream"" he ""had bequeathed us"" is something ""we could never forget"" (253).  And the other main member of the family, John's mother-in-law Rosa Millard, takes care of the extended plantation family, slaves and all, while John is away at the war with a selflessness that is impressive, endearing, and a personification of the ideal of <em>noblesse oblige</em>.  If Faulkner's representation of the Sutpen family challenges the myth of the Old South, the Sartorises in this novel go a long way toward recuperating it.</p>
<p>The racial politics of the novel are much less disconcerting too, if one wants to preserve ""black"" and ""white"" as distinct categories.  Sutpen has a child with one of his slaves, and his first born son is also ""part Negro.""  Readers of the stories might have wondered whether the slave Ringo is actually an (illegitimate) member of the Sartoris family, teased by the fact, for example, that as Bayard says, Ringo ""calls Granny 'Granny' just like I did"" (7), or the fact that Bayard never identifies a father for Ringo.  But in revising Faulkner made it clear that there was no place for Ringo on the Sartoris family tree.  One of the earliest changes he made was to have Bayard state overtly that another slave, Simon, is ""Ringo's father"" (17).</p>

The proof of that is the way, as described in the rest of the story, Bayard hunts down and kills the outlaw Grumby, who had killed his Granny in the previous short story in the series.  Defending one's family by seeking private vengeance is a part of the aristocratic code that the Sartorises live by, but in this case, as Buck has seen for himself, Bayard's revenge includes the act of skinning Grumby's body and nailing the 'hide' to a wall - a practice that Bayard learned from ""a book at home about Borneo"" and its headhunters (115).  Bayard also cuts off Grumby's hand and attaches it to Granny's headstone.  Faulkner deletes the reference to headhunters in Borneo when he republishes ""Vendee"" in the novel <em>The Unvanquished</em>, but it's a jarring detail in the story: connecting the aristocratic ""home"" of the Sartorises with the jungles of savagery.

The only member of the family whose character is developed at any length is Byron.  He is explicitly ""animal-like"" (276), with ""hairy hands"" (78), ""down to the second joints of his fingers"" (101), and a ""drooling mouth"" (270).  His name evokes the great Romantic poet, and in fact Byron is the one writer in the novel - but his quasi-obscene love letters to Narcissa Benbow, daughter of one of the oldest, most aristocratic families in Jefferson, are definitive symbols of the kind of squalid assault the Snopeses, as avatars of the modern South, mount against the traditional order.

Following in his wake are five more Snopeses: in order of their arrival in the Bend, I.O., Eck, Mink, Ike and Lump. They refer to each other as cousins, all children of different fathers who may have been brothers of Ab Snopes.  Mink tells Ratliff that he, Flem and Ike had a common ""grandma"" (84), which suggests that Ab's own father, the ur-Snopes who never appears in the fictions, must have had two wives; Mink says as much in <em>The Mansion</em>, written twenty years after <em>The Hamlet</em>.  However, in the way this first Snopes novel describes the extended family, the phrase ""nobody ever knew for certain"" exactly what ""the relationship was"" - used to describe the connection between Flem and Eck (73) - sums up the general difficulty of drawing a definitive Snopes family tree (73).  Economically the members of the family seem allied by their ambitions, but their emotional bonds are very tenuous - except for the rage that Mink and his (unnamed) wife feel toward Flem's success; Mink's hostility toward Flem will become a major motif in the trilogy's final volume.</p>
<p>The various male Snopeses are drawn very vividly, but their lives and familial relationships are depicted from a distance.  The third-person narrator often sees them through V.K. Ratliff's eyes, and Ratliff shares their class origins (his father and Ab were both sharecroppers on Anse Holland's place, 29).  But Ratliff's attitude toward the family alternates between astonishment and consternation, and neither he nor the narrator display any hint of empathy.  The life of Eula Varner, the young woman whom Flem marries as another step upward on the social ladder he's climbing, is described in considerable detail - until she becomes ""Mrs. Snopes,"" at which point she becomes essentially opaque.</p>

In this story he is apparently helping Bayard's Granny in the extra-military campaign she wages against the invading Union Army on behalf of the people of Yoknapatawpha, but by the end it is tragically clear that the only cause Ab serves is his own self-interest.</p>

Although this story (and even its characters) only refer to her as ""Mrs. Harriss,"" elsewhere in the canon readers learn she was born Melisandre Backus, a fact that roots her still more deeply in the county's aristocracy, via a Civil War era relative of Colonel Sartoris' wife.  Gavin first courted her twenty years ago, when she was sixteen and represented for him the old world that had been threatened, if not destroyed, by the First World War; when the narrative ends at the beginning of the Second World War, they are finally married, though it's not clear what difference this might make to the Stevens family's future.  The story inside this story is the one Faulkner develops most dramatically: it describes a homicidal plot by Mrs. Harriss' son Max to kill an Argentinian named Gualdres to prevent him from marrying her.  Gavin discovers and forestalls the plot, and before proposing himself congratulates Gualdres on his marriage, to Mrs. Harriss' daughter (also not given a name).  The story is told in the third person, much of it from the perspective of Gavin's seventeen-year-old nephew, Charles (the only name he is given), but except for his work with his uncle on the 'murder case,' it largely ignores his family life; for example, he and Gavin go home several times, for ""dinner"" and ""supper,"" and Charles eats breakfast once, but no other people are mentioned at all in those cases.</p>

The other genealogical mystery involves Elnora.  When she appears in the novel's first chapter, the narrator describes her as ""a tall mulatto woman"" (9), a phrase that explicitly presumes that one of her parents is white.

""My Grandmother Millard and General Bedford Forrest and the Battle of Hurricane Creek"" (1942) takes place in 1862, chronologically before any of the previous stories.  The ""battle of Hurricane Creek"" is a fiction constructed to allow Philip Backhouse, a member of an old southern family, to change his humiliating last name and marry Melisandre, Granny's niece and so from another old southern family.  Intertextually, Faulkner changes two of the Strothers' names as well: Loosh is now called Lucius, and Philadelphy, Philadelphia.  As in the first two tales in the series, Lucius proclaims ""more than once"" that the Yankees are coming (669), and with them will come the fulfillment of his longing for freedom.  Both Granny and the story, however, treat his aspirations with a kind of sarcastic contempt.  As part of the story's romance plot, Granny sends him in the direction of the war to find the Confederate General Forrest, but instead of using this opportunity to link up with the Union forces, Lucius gets so lost that ""he didn't know where he had been"" for four days and is benevolently brought back to Sartoris in ""one of General Forrest's forage wagons"" (690).  Ringo is reduced to the role of supporting player.  Louvinia is explicitly referred to as ""Mammy"" (687).  Early in the tale a group of renegade Yankee soldiers do attack Sartoris, destroying the ""back house"" (676) - that is, the ""outhouse"" or ""privy"" behind the big house (675).

The most significant addition, however, is the information that Elnora and Bayard Sartoris are siblings: after describing her as a ""mulatto"" in <em>Flags</em>, Faulkner here reveals that her white father is John Sartoris - making Elnora herself and her children members of both families.  The story's narrator carefully refers to Simon now as ""Elnora's mother's husband"" (727), but that is the only reference to ""Elnora's mother""; in <em>Flags</em> Simon is married to Euphrony, so it can be presumed that she is the woman with whom Sartoris had sex, but that is a presumption.  Another source of confusion is the way Caspey is now referred to as ""Elnora's husband""; in the earlier <em>Flags</em> he is Elnora's brother.  One of Elnora's children - Joby - has moved away (to Memphis), and Caspey is ""in the penitentiary for stealing,"" but the other living members of the Strothers family all remain on the Sartoris plantation, where they work for the white family as servants.  One of the story's longest scenes is Elnora's conversation with Saddie and Isom, but her subject is the ""quality"" of the family they serve, which she tells Isom is ""something you don't know nothing about"" (732).</p>

For example, Loosh appears only when Bayard compares the poor people of Yoknapatawpha looking at Granny to the way the hounds used to look at Loosh when he went into their kennels to feed them (85).  Ringo is still a slave, but when Bayard notes that ""he was taller than me now"" (78), it feels like an acknowledgment of the amount of independence and authority Ringo displays as Granny's resourceful second-in-command in the bloodless campaign to convert Yankee mules into cash to sustain the collapsing economy of the county.</p>

"19643","<a href=""/content/strothersinuv"">StrothersInUV</a>","<a href=""/content/strotherfamily"">StrotherFamily</a>","<p>When Faulkner gathered the six short stories Bayard narrates, along with a seventh that he had not been able to sell, into a novel, he made a number of revisions that significantly effect the story of the Strothers family.  Early in ""Ambuscade"" as the novel's first chapter, he clears up some of the potential ambiguity about Ringo's place on the Strothers family tree by specifying that Ringo is Simon's son and Louvinia's grandson - though still novel still makes no mention of Ringo's mother, except when Bayard says both he and Ringo nursed at same breast.  Simon himself appears in the novel's last chapter, ""An Odor of Verbena,"" a loyal ""body servant"" grieving beside John Sartoris' coffin.  Also in this final chapter Loosh, who had last been seen going off with his wife to find freedom from slavery, makes a brief and unexplained appearance as an employee in the Sartoris stable.  And both Bayard's actions in the story and his narrative of the story essentially relegate Ringo to the same role that Isom plays in Bayard's life at start of <em>Flags</em> - holding the reins of Bayard's horse, or opening the gate for Bayard to ride through.</p>

"19638","<a href=""/content/strothersinven"">StrothersInVEN</a>","<a href=""/content/strotherfamily"">StrotherFamily</a>","<p>Ringo is removed almost entirely from the context of his family as his character continues to outgrow the conventional boundaries for slaves and other blacks in both Faulkner's fiction and cultural stereotypes.  During his and Bayard's pursuit of the men responsible for killing Granny at the end of ""The Unvanquished,"" Ringo helps Uncle Buck tie Ab Snopes - a Snopes but still a white man - to a tree, and it is Ringo who whips him (109).  Ringo then helps Bayard overpower another white man, Grumby, by stabbing him; together the two young men, in a scene that the narrative spares the reader, complete their revenge by mutilating Grumby's corpse.  Of course, the dynamics here are subtle - Ringo is a slave taking violent revenge on two white men, but in a way that still shows him serving the interests of the white family that owns him.  And interestingly, while Bayard and Ringo act in concert throughout the tale, in the story's final lines Uncle Buck proclaims how their actions prove that <em>Bayard</em> ""is John Sartoris' boy"" (117) - an ending that erases Ringo's role.</p>

"19649","<a href=""/content/sutpensinaa"">SutpensInAA</a>","<a href=""/content/sutpenfamily"">SutpenFamily</a>","<p>In <em>Absalom!</em> Faulkner undertakes his most ambitious imaginative reconstruction of the rise and fall of the Old South, along with the vexed legacy that history bequeaths to the modern South. He organizes that larger story around the history of the Sutpens across six generations - especially the two generations who go through the experience of the Civil War.  The novel includes two earlier generations, including the first Sutpen to arrive in colonial America, and two later generations, including the last of the Sutpens, who disappears into the Yoknapatawpha landscape ten years into the 20th century.  At the heart of the story is Thomas Sutpen, and the five children he has with four different women - only two of whom he acknowledges as his, though that does not enable even them to escape the tragic way in which the ""family"" in this novel serves as the site in which the South's racial, socio-economic and cultural tensions and taboos collide.</p>
